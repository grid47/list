You are given an integer `num` and you must apply a set of operations twice to generate two new integers. The goal is to find the maximum difference between the results of these operations.

{{< dots >}}
### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input consists of a single integer `num`, which represents the number you will perform operations on.
- **Example:** `num = 123`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= num <= 10^8

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** The output is the maximum difference between the two integers `a` and `b` after applying the operations.
- **Example:** `87`
- **Constraints:**
	- The output is a non-negative integer representing the maximum difference.

### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** To find the maximum difference between two new integers generated by applying two transformations to the original number.

- Step 1: Try all combinations of `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9).
- Step 2: For each combination, replace all occurrences of `x` with `y` in `num`.
- Step 3: Calculate the resulting numbers `a` and `b`, and find the difference between them.
- Step 4: Return the maximum difference.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The input number `num` is guaranteed to be a valid integer in the given range.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `num = 123`  \
  **Explanation:** By choosing `x = 1` and `y = 9`, the first operation produces `923`. By choosing `x = 1` and `y = 0`, the second operation produces `23`. The maximum difference is `923 - 23 = 87`.

- **Input:** `num = 408`  \
  **Explanation:** By choosing `x = 4` and `y = 9`, the first operation produces `908`. By choosing `x = 4` and `y = 0`, the second operation produces `0`. The maximum difference is `908 - 0 = 408`.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
We will iterate through all possible values for `x` and `y` and apply the transformations to the given number. We will then find the maximum difference between the resulting numbers.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The two digits `x` and `y` can be any digit from 0 to 9.
- The maximum difference will be achieved by manipulating the number to maximize one result while minimizing the other.
- By trying different combinations of `x` and `y`, we can systematically calculate all possible outcomes.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- The problem guarantees that `num` will be at least 1, so there are no empty inputs.
- Ensure the solution can handle values up to 10^8 efficiently.
- Consider cases where the digits are the same (e.g., `num = 1111`) and cases with zeros (e.g., `num = 100`).
- Ensure that no result contains leading zeros or becomes 0.

## Code üíª
```cpp

int change(int num, int x, int y) {
    int tmp = 0, ten = 1;
    int digit;
    while(num) {
        digit = num % 10;
        if(digit == x) digit = y;
        tmp = ten * digit + tmp;
        num /= 10;
        ten *= 10;
    }
    return digit == 0? -1: tmp;
}

int maxDiff(int num) {
    int mn = num, mx = num;
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
        if(i == j) continue;
        int ret = change(num, i, j);
        if(ret <= 0) continue;
        mn = min(mn, ret);
        mx = max(mx, ret);
    }
    cout << mx << " " << mn;
    return mx - mn;
}
```

The `maxDiff` function calculates the maximum difference between numbers that can be created by changing digits of the input number `num` using the `change` function. The `change` function modifies digits in the number by replacing one digit with another and returns the modified number or `-1` if no valid modification is possible.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int change(int num, int x, int y) {
	```
	Defines the `change` function that modifies the digits of a number `num`, replacing occurrences of digit `x` with digit `y`.

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int tmp = 0, ten = 1;
	```
	Initializes two variables: `tmp` to store the modified number, and `ten` to track the place value of the digits during the process.

3. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int digit;
	```
	Declares an integer variable `digit` to store the current digit of `num` as it is processed.

4. **Loop Constructs**
	```cpp
	    while(num) {
	```
	Starts a loop that processes each digit of the number `num` until all digits are processed.

5. **Modulo Operation**
	```cpp
	        digit = num % 10;
	```
	Extracts the last digit of `num` using the modulo operation.

6. **Conditional Operation**
	```cpp
	        if(digit == x) digit = y;
	```
	Checks if the extracted digit is equal to `x`. If so, it replaces the digit with `y`.

7. **Digit Rebuilding**
	```cpp
	        tmp = ten * digit + tmp;
	```
	Reconstructs the modified number by adding the current digit (adjusted for place value) to `tmp`.

8. **Number Update**
	```cpp
	        num /= 10;
	```
	Removes the last digit of `num` by dividing it by 10.

9. **Place Value Update**
	```cpp
	        ten *= 10;
	```
	Multiplies `ten` by 10 to shift the place value for the next digit.

10. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return digit == 0? -1: tmp;
	```
	Checks if the last processed digit is zero. If so, returns `-1` to indicate no valid modification, otherwise returns the modified number.

11. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int maxDiff(int num) {
	```
	Defines the `maxDiff` function that calculates the maximum difference by calling the `change` function for various digit replacements.

12. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int mn = num, mx = num;
	```
	Initializes two variables `mn` and `mx` to track the minimum and maximum numbers obtained by modifying the digits of `num`.

13. **Nested Loop**
	```cpp
	    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	```
	Starts a loop that iterates through all possible digits `i` (from 0 to 9) to replace in the number `num`.

14. **Nested Loop**
	```cpp
	    for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
	```
	Starts an inner loop to try replacing the digit `i` with every possible digit `j` (from 0 to 9).

15. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	        if(i == j) continue;
	```
	Checks if `i` and `j` are the same. If so, it skips this iteration as no change would occur.

16. **Function Call**
	```cpp
	        int ret = change(num, i, j);
	```
	Calls the `change` function to modify `num` by replacing digit `i` with digit `j`.

17. **Condition Check**
	```cpp
	        if(ret <= 0) continue;
	```
	Checks if the result of `change` is less than or equal to zero. If so, it skips the current iteration.

18. **Min/Max Update**
	```cpp
	        mn = min(mn, ret);
	```
	Updates `mn` to the minimum of its current value and the result from the `change` function.

19. **Min/Max Update**
	```cpp
	        mx = max(mx, ret);
	```
	Updates `mx` to the maximum of its current value and the result from the `change` function.

20. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return mx - mn;
	```
	Returns the difference between the maximum and minimum modified values.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(1), for small values of `num`.
- **Average Case:** O(100), since we try up to 100 combinations of `x` and `y`.
- **Worst Case:** O(100), as we are iterating over the digits 0-9 for both `x` and `y`.

The time complexity is constant in terms of iterations but depends on the number of combinations for `x` and `y`.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(1), as no additional space is required.
- **Worst Case:** O(1), only a few variables are needed.

The space complexity is constant as we only store a few variables.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
