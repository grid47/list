### Problem Statement

The task is to determine the maximum difference between two numbers that can be formed by changing the digits of a given number. Specifically, you are allowed to change any one digit (from 0 to 9) to another digit (also from 0 to 9), and the goal is to maximize the difference between the largest and smallest numbers you can create through these changes. 

### Approach

The solution involves the following steps:
1. **Iterate through Possible Digit Changes**: For each digit from 0 to 9, iterate through every other digit from 0 to 9. If the two digits are the same, skip to the next pair.
2. **Change Digits**: For each pair of digits, use a helper function to create a new number by changing occurrences of the first digit to the second.
3. **Track Maximum and Minimum**: Keep track of the maximum and minimum numbers generated by these transformations.
4. **Calculate the Difference**: The final result is the difference between the maximum and minimum values obtained.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Letâ€™s break down the provided code to understand how it implements this approach effectively:

1. **Class Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
   ```

   - We define a class named `Solution`, which contains the methods for solving the problem.

2. **Helper Function `change`**:
   ```cpp
   int change(int num, int x, int y) {
   ```

   - This method takes three parameters: `num` (the original number), `x` (the digit to be changed), and `y` (the digit to change `x` to).

3. **Digit Transformation**:
   ```cpp
   int tmp = 0, ten = 1;
   int digit;
   while(num) {
       digit = num % 10;
       if(digit == x) digit = y;
       tmp = ten * digit + tmp;
       num /= 10;
       ten *= 10;
   }
   ```

   - In this section, we initialize `tmp` to hold the new number and `ten` to keep track of the place value (units, tens, hundreds, etc.).
   - The `while` loop processes each digit of `num` from least significant to most significant. If a digit equals `x`, we change it to `y`. The modified digit is then added to `tmp` with the correct place value.

4. **Return Modified Number**:
   ```cpp
   return digit == 0 ? -1 : tmp;
   ```

   - After processing all digits, if the most significant digit was `0`, we return `-1` to indicate an invalid number (leading zeros are not allowed). Otherwise, we return the newly formed number.

5. **Main Function `maxDiff`**:
   ```cpp
   int maxDiff(int num) {
       int mn = num, mx = num;
   ```

   - This function initializes both `mn` (minimum) and `mx` (maximum) to the original number.

6. **Iterate Through Digit Pairs**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
   for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
       if(i == j) continue;
       int ret = change(num, i, j);
       if(ret <= 0) continue;
       mn = min(mn, ret);
       mx = max(mx, ret);
   }
   ```

   - The nested loops iterate through all pairs of digits (from 0 to 9).
   - If the digits are the same, we skip the iteration.
   - The `change` function is called to generate a new number. If the returned number is valid (greater than 0), we update `mn` and `mx` accordingly.

7. **Output Results**:
   ```cpp
   cout << mx << " " << mn;
   return mx - mn;
   ```

   - Finally, the function prints the maximum and minimum numbers for debugging purposes and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \(O(1)\), which is effectively constant time. This is because the nested loops iterate a fixed number of times (10x10), and the helper function processes the digits of `num` in linear time relative to its number of digits.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we use a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is an efficient and straightforward approach to finding the maximum difference between two numbers derived from a given number by changing its digits. The implementation utilizes basic loops and a helper function, showcasing clear logic and functionality.

#### Key Takeaways:

1. **Iterative Digit Manipulation**: The solution effectively manipulates each digit and builds new numbers based on specified changes, demonstrating practical skills in digit manipulation.
2. **Edge Cases**: By checking for invalid results (like leading zeros), the solution accounts for potential pitfalls that might arise during digit transformation.
3. **Efficiency**: The algorithm operates efficiently in constant time due to the bounded nature of the digit changes, making it suitable for various input sizes.

Overall, this code serves as an excellent example of handling digit-based problems in programming, emphasizing both clarity and efficiency in its design.
