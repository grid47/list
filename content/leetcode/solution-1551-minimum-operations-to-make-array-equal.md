Given an integer n, create an array arr of length n where arr[i] = (2 * i) + 1. You can perform operations to make all elements in the array equal, with the goal of minimizing the number of operations.

### Input Representations 📥
- **Input:** The input consists of a single integer n, representing the length of the array.
- **Example:** `n = 4`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= n <= 10^4

### Output Specifications 📤
- **Output:** Return the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements in the array equal.
- **Example:** `Output: 4`
- **Constraints:**
	- The operations should minimize the number of steps to equalize all elements.

### Core Logic 🔍
**Goal:** The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal.

- 1. Calculate the target value (average of all elements).
- 2. Calculate how many operations are needed to move each element towards the target.
- 3. Perform operations to redistribute the values to achieve equality with the fewest steps.

### Problem Assumptions ✅
- The input n is always a positive integer within the specified bounds.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples 🧩
- **Input:** `n = 4`  \
  **Explanation:** The array starts as [1, 3, 5, 7]. The goal is to make all elements equal to 4 by minimizing the number of operations. The operations are performed as described to achieve equality in 4 steps.

- **Input:** `n = 5`  \
  **Explanation:** For n = 5, the array is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. The goal is to make all elements equal to 5, and it takes 6 operations to do so.

## Approach 🚀
To minimize the number of operations, we calculate the target value (the average) and use efficient redistribution of values to achieve equality.

### Initial Thoughts 💭
- The values in the array are already in an increasing pattern, which makes the task of balancing the values easier.
- The solution should focus on redistributing the values towards the target value and minimizing the number of moves to balance the array.

### Edge Cases 🌐
- The input array is never empty as n is always >= 1.
- The solution should handle large values of n (up to 10^4) efficiently.
- If n is 1, no operations are needed as the array already has a single element.
- Ensure the solution works for values of n up to 10^4.

## Code 💻
```cpp
int minOperations(int n) {
    return n * n / 4;
}
```

This function calculates the minimum number of operations needed for a specific problem, returning the result of `n * n / 4` based on the input parameter `n`.

{{< dots >}}
### Step-by-Step Breakdown 🛠️
1. **Function Declaration**
	```cpp
	int minOperations(int n) {
	```
	This is the function declaration where `minOperations` is defined to take an integer `n` as input and returns the minimum number of operations, calculated as `n * n / 4`.

2. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return n * n / 4;
	```
	The function returns the result of the mathematical expression `n * n / 4`, which is the calculated value based on the input `n`.

## Complexity Analysis 📊
### Time Complexity ⏳
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Average Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

The solution involves calculating the target value and performing a few mathematical operations, so it is constant time.

### Space Complexity 💾
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

The solution uses only a constant amount of space.
