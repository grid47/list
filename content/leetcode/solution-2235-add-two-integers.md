{{< dots >}}
### Input Representations 📥
- **Input:** The input consists of two integers num1 and num2.
- **Example:** `num1 = 8, num2 = -3`
- **Constraints:**
	- -100 <= num1, num2 <= 100

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications 📤
- **Output:** Return the sum of num1 and num2 as an integer.
- **Example:** `Output: 5`
- **Constraints:**
	- The result will always be within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

### Core Logic 🔍
**Goal:** Compute the sum of two integers using basic arithmetic.

- 1. Take the two input integers, num1 and num2.
- 2. Compute their sum using the addition operator.
- 3. Return the resulting sum.

### Problem Assumptions ✅
- The input will always consist of two valid integers.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples 🧩
- **Input:** `Input: num1 = 8, num2 = -3`  \
  **Explanation:** The sum of 8 and -3 is 5, so the output is 5.

- **Input:** `Input: num1 = 20, num2 = 15`  \
  **Explanation:** The sum of 20 and 15 is 35, so the output is 35.

- **Input:** `Input: num1 = -50, num2 = -25`  \
  **Explanation:** The sum of -50 and -25 is -75, so the output is -75.

## Approach 🚀
A straightforward approach involves using the addition operator to compute the sum of the two integers.

### Initial Thoughts 💭
- The problem requires basic arithmetic.
- The constraints ensure the input values are manageable.
- A simple addition operation is sufficient to solve this problem.

### Edge Cases 🌐
- Not applicable, as input is guaranteed to include two integers.
- Not applicable, as the input range is limited to -100 to 100.
- Input values at the edge of the range, e.g., -100 and 100.
- Ensure the solution works for both positive and negative integers.

## Code 💻
```cpp
int sum(int num1, int num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}
```

This function takes two integer inputs, 'num1' and 'num2', and returns their sum. It demonstrates a simple arithmetic operation in C++.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown 🛠️
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int sum(int num1, int num2) {
	```
	Defines the function 'sum' that takes two integer parameters, 'num1' and 'num2', and will return their sum.

2. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return num1 + num2;
	```
	Returns the sum of 'num1' and 'num2' as the result of the function.

## Complexity Analysis 📊
### Time Complexity ⏳
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Average Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

The addition operation has constant time complexity.

### Space Complexity 💾
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

The space complexity is constant, as no additional memory is used apart from the input and output.

**Happy Coding! 🎉**
