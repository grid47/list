You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid`. A **rhombus sum** refers to the sum of the elements that form the border of a rhombus shape. The rhombus should be viewed as a square rotated 45 degrees, with each of its corners centered on a grid cell. Compute the biggest three distinct rhombus sums in the grid and return them in descending order. If there are fewer than three distinct sums, return all of them.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** You are given a 2D matrix `grid` of integers.
- **Example:** `For grid = [[5,1,3],[4,2,6],[7,8,9]].`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= m, n <= 50
	- 1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the biggest three distinct rhombus sums in descending order. If fewer than three distinct sums exist, return all of them.
- **Example:** `For grid = [[5,1,3],[4,2,6],[7,8,9]], the output is [25, 17, 12].`
- **Constraints:**
	- The output should be an array of integers representing the biggest three distinct rhombus sums.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** To find the rhombus sums, we need to iterate through all possible centers in the grid and calculate the sum of elements that form the rhombus for each center.

- Iterate over each cell in the grid to treat it as a potential center of a rhombus.
- For each center, compute the sum of all grid elements that form the rhombus border.
- Store these sums in a set to ensure distinct values.
- Sort the set and return the top three distinct sums.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The grid is at least 1x1 in size.
- All grid elements are positive integers.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `For grid = [[5,1,3],[4,2,6],[7,8,9]].`  \
  **Explanation:** The rhombus sums for the three biggest distinct rhombuses are: 25, 17, and 12.

- **Input:** `For grid = [[7, 7, 7]].`  \
  **Explanation:** Since all rhombus sums are the same, the output is [7].

## Approach üöÄ
The approach to solving this problem involves calculating the rhombus sum for each possible center in the grid. For each center, we add the values of the grid cells that make up the rhombus and store them. The biggest three distinct sums are then returned.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The rhombus shape can expand out from a center and includes values from adjacent cells at varying distances.
- We need to carefully iterate through all possible rhombus shapes, ensuring we compute the correct sums and handle distinct values efficiently.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- Not applicable as the grid is guaranteed to have at least one row and one column.
- The algorithm should efficiently handle grids as large as 50x50.
- All elements being the same value or all rhombus sums being identical.
- The grid should be within the given constraints.

## Code üíª
```cpp
class Solution {
typedef long long ll;
public:
vector<int> getBiggestThree(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
    set<int> s;
    for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            for(int sz = 0; i + sz < m && i - sz >= 0 && j + 2 * sz < n; sz++) {
                
                ll x = i, y = j, rsum = 0;
                do rsum += grid[x++][y++]; while(x < i + sz);
                if(sz > 0) {
                    
                    do rsum += grid[x--][y++]; while(y < j + 2 * sz);
                    do rsum += grid[x--][y--]; while(x > i - sz);
                    do rsum += grid[x++][y--]; while(x < i);
                    
                }
                s.insert(rsum);
                if(s.size() > 3) {
                    s.erase(begin(s));}
            }
            }
        }
    return vector<int>(rbegin(s), rend(s));
}
```

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(m * n)
- **Average Case:** O(m * n * k)
- **Worst Case:** O(m * n * k)

The time complexity depends on the size of the grid and the maximum possible size of a rhombus that can be formed from each cell.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(m * n)

Space complexity is O(m * n) due to the storage of rhombus sums in a set.
