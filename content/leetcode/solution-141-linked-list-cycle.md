### üß© **Understanding the Problem: Detect Cycle in Linked List**

The problem asks us to determine whether a given singly linked list contains a cycle. A cycle in a linked list occurs when a node‚Äôs `next` pointer points to one of the previous nodes, forming a loop. The goal is to return `true` if the linked list has a cycle and `false` otherwise.

For example:
- **Input**: `head = [3, 2, 0, -4]`, `pos = 1` (where `pos` indicates the node at which the cycle starts).
- **Output**: `true` (since the node at index 1 points back to itself, forming a cycle).

- **Input**: `head = [1, 2]`, `pos = -1`.
- **Output**: `false` (no cycle).

### üîÑ **Approach: Floyd‚Äôs Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare)**

To detect a cycle in a singly linked list, we can use **Floyd‚Äôs Cycle-Finding Algorithm**, also known as the **Tortoise and Hare** algorithm. This algorithm utilizes two pointers:
1. A **slow pointer** (`tortoise`) that moves one step at a time.
2. A **fast pointer** (`hare`) that moves two steps at a time.

#### Key Ideas:
- **If a cycle exists**: The fast pointer will eventually catch up with the slow pointer within the cycle.
- **If no cycle**: The fast pointer will reach the end of the list.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Both the slow and fast pointers start at the head of the list.
2. **Traversal**: In each iteration, the slow pointer moves one step, and the fast pointer moves two steps.
3. **Cycle Detection**: If the slow pointer and the fast pointer meet at any point, a cycle exists, and we return `true`.
4. **End of List**: If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list (`fast == NULL` or `fast->next == NULL`), we return `false`, indicating that there is no cycle.

### üñ•Ô∏è **Code Breakdown: Step-by-Step**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Function Definition and Initialization**

```cpp
bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
    ListNode* slow = head, *fast = head;
```
- The function `hasCycle` takes a pointer `head` to the first node of the linked list.
- We initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the `head` of the list. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Traversing the List**

```cpp
while(fast && fast->next) {
    slow = slow->next;
    fast = fast->next->next;
```
- The `while` loop ensures that we continue traversing as long as `fast` and `fast->next` are not `NULL`. If `fast` reaches `NULL`, there‚Äôs no cycle, and we can return `false`.
- Inside the loop:
  - The `slow` pointer advances by one node: `slow = slow->next`.
  - The `fast` pointer advances by two nodes: `fast = fast->next->next`.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Cycle Detection**

```cpp
if(slow == fast) return true;
```
- After advancing both pointers, we check if `slow` and `fast` are pointing to the same node. If they are, it means the fast pointer has caught up with the slow pointer inside the cycle, indicating that a cycle exists. We return `true`.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **End of the List**

```cpp
return false;
```
- If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list (`fast == NULL` or `fast->next == NULL`), we return `false` because the list doesn‚Äôt have a cycle.

### üßÆ **Time and Space Complexity**

#### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time Complexity**:
- **O(n)**: In the worst case, the fast pointer will traverse the list at most twice: once moving two steps per iteration and then meeting the slow pointer. This gives a linear time complexity, O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the list.

#### üß≥ **Space Complexity**:
- **O(1)**: We only use two pointers (`slow` and `fast`), and the algorithm doesn‚Äôt require any additional space that grows with the size of the input. Hence, the space complexity is constant, O(1).

---

### üéØ **Conclusion: Efficient Cycle Detection**

Floyd‚Äôs Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare) efficiently detects whether a singly linked list contains a cycle. Here‚Äôs why this approach is optimal:

1. **Time Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in linear time, O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes. This is optimal because each node is visited at most once.
2. **Space Efficiency**: The solution uses constant space, O(1), as it only requires two pointers regardless of the size of the list.
3. **Simplicity**: This approach is easy to implement and avoids the need for extra space, such as a hash set or modifying the list structure.

#### Key Insights:
- **Fast and Slow Pointers**: The crux of this algorithm is the two-pointer approach, where one pointer moves faster than the other, helping us detect cycles when the fast pointer eventually meets the slow pointer.
- **Optimal Solution**: The algorithm is optimal for cycle detection due to its linear time complexity and constant space usage.

In conclusion, this is a highly efficient and widely-used algorithm for cycle detection in linked lists.
