Five philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Each philosopher alternates between thinking and eating. A philosopher can only eat when both their left and right forks are available. Design a system where no philosopher will starve and they can continue alternating between eating and thinking.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input consists of an integer n representing the number of times each philosopher will call the function wantsToEat. The philosophers are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise direction, and they request the forks one by one.
- **Example:** `n = 1`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= n <= 60

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** The output consists of an array of operations in the form [a, b, c] where: a is the philosopher id, b indicates the fork (1 for left, 2 for right), and c indicates the operation (1 for pick, 2 for put, 3 for eat).
- **Example:** `[[4, 2, 1], [4, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 0, 3], [2, 1, 2], [2, 2, 2], [4, 0, 3], [4, 1, 2], [0, 2, 1], [4, 2, 2], [3, 2, 1], [3, 1, 1], [0, 0, 3], [0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 2], [1, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [3, 0, 3], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 2], [1, 0, 3], [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2]]`
- **Constraints:**
	- Each philosopher calls the function at least once.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** To ensure no philosopher ever starves while alternating between eating and thinking. The philosopher must acquire both forks before eating and release them afterward.

- Each philosopher alternates between thinking and attempting to eat.
- The philosopher first picks the left fork, then the right fork (or vice versa depending on the philosopher's id).
- Once both forks are acquired, the philosopher starts eating.
- After eating, the philosopher puts down both forks, making them available for others.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- Each philosopher alternates between thinking and eating.
- A philosopher cannot eat without holding both forks.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `n = 1`  \
  **Explanation:** In this example, each philosopher calls the function once. The result is a series of operations where each philosopher picks up their forks, eats, and then puts down the forks in turn.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
To simulate the alternating process of eating and thinking while preventing starvation, we use mutex locks to ensure that philosophers only acquire forks when available and release them when done.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- Philosophers should not block each other from eating by acquiring forks in an arbitrary order.
- We can implement a mutual exclusion mechanism using mutex locks to ensure forks are picked and released in a safe manner.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- No empty inputs are allowed.
- For larger values of n, the number of philosopher actions will increase, but the system must remain efficient.
- Ensure that all philosophers can eat indefinitely and never starve.
- Each philosopher must alternate between thinking and eating without blocking others.

## Code üíª
```cpp
mutex mtx[5];
DiningPhilosophers() {
    
}

void wantsToEat(int philosopher,
                function<void()> pickLeftFork,
                function<void()> pickRightFork,
                function<void()> eat,
                function<void()> putLeftFork,
                function<void()> putRightFork) {
		
    int left = philosopher;
    int right = (philosopher + 1) % 5;
    
    unique_lock<mutex> lck1(mtx[left], defer_lock);
    unique_lock<mutex> lck2(mtx[right], defer_lock);
    
    if(philosopher % 2) {
        lck1.lock();
        lck2.lock();
        pickLeftFork();
        pickRightFork();
    } else {
        lck2.lock();
        lck1.lock();
        pickLeftFork();
        pickRightFork();            
    }
    eat();
    putLeftFork();
    putRightFork();
}
```

This code defines the solution for the Dining Philosophers problem, where philosophers need to acquire two forks to eat, while avoiding deadlocks and ensuring that they can eat in turns.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Variable Declaration**
	```cpp
	mutex mtx[5];
	```
	A mutex array `mtx[5]` is declared to manage access to the forks (shared resources) for each philosopher.

2. **Constructor**
	```cpp
	DiningPhilosophers() {
	```
	This is the constructor for the `DiningPhilosophers` class, where the mutex array is initialized.

3. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	void wantsToEat(int philosopher,
	```
	This is the function definition for `wantsToEat`, which simulates a philosopher's request to eat. It accepts the philosopher's ID and functions for picking up and putting down forks, as well as eating.

4. **Function Parameter**
	```cpp
	                function<void()> pickLeftFork,
	```
	A function parameter `pickLeftFork` that simulates picking up the left fork.

5. **Function Parameter**
	```cpp
	                function<void()> pickRightFork,
	```
	A function parameter `pickRightFork` that simulates picking up the right fork.

6. **Function Parameter**
	```cpp
	                function<void()> eat,
	```
	A function parameter `eat` that simulates the action of eating.

7. **Function Parameter**
	```cpp
	                function<void()> putLeftFork,
	```
	A function parameter `putLeftFork` that simulates putting down the left fork.

8. **Function Parameter**
	```cpp
	                function<void()> putRightFork) {
	```
	A function parameter `putRightFork` that simulates putting down the right fork.

9. **Fork Index Calculation**
	```cpp
	    int left = philosopher;
	```
	The `left` fork is assigned to the philosopher's position (index), corresponding to the philosopher's ID.

10. **Fork Index Calculation**
	```cpp
	    int right = (philosopher + 1) % 5;
	```
	The `right` fork is the next fork, calculated using modulo 5 to handle the circular arrangement of philosophers.

11. **Mutex Lock Setup**
	```cpp
	    unique_lock<mutex> lck1(mtx[left], defer_lock);
	```
	A `unique_lock` is created for the left fork (`lck1`), with the `defer_lock` option to avoid locking immediately.

12. **Mutex Lock Setup**
	```cpp
	    unique_lock<mutex> lck2(mtx[right], defer_lock);
	```
	A `unique_lock` is created for the right fork (`lck2`), again with the `defer_lock` option.

13. **Philosopher Eating Logic**
	```cpp
	    if(philosopher % 2) {
	```
	An if condition is used to alternate the order in which philosophers acquire the forks to avoid deadlocks.

14. **Locking Forks**
	```cpp
	        lck1.lock();
	```
	The left fork is locked.

15. **Locking Forks**
	```cpp
	        lck2.lock();
	```
	The right fork is locked.

16. **Fork Pickup**
	```cpp
	        pickLeftFork();
	```
	The function to pick up the left fork is called.

17. **Fork Pickup**
	```cpp
	        pickRightFork();
	```
	The function to pick up the right fork is called.

18. **Philosopher Eating Logic**
	```cpp
	    } else {
	```
	If the philosopher's ID is even, the order of locking the forks is reversed to avoid deadlocks.

19. **Locking Forks**
	```cpp
	        lck2.lock();
	```
	The right fork is locked first.

20. **Locking Forks**
	```cpp
	        lck1.lock();
	```
	The left fork is locked second.

21. **Fork Pickup**
	```cpp
	        pickLeftFork();
	```
	The function to pick up the left fork is called.

22. **Fork Pickup**
	```cpp
	        pickRightFork();            
	```
	The function to pick up the right fork is called.

23. **Eat Action**
	```cpp
	    eat();
	```
	The philosopher eats.

24. **Put Fork Down**
	```cpp
	    putLeftFork();
	```
	The philosopher puts down the left fork.

25. **Put Fork Down**
	```cpp
	    putRightFork();
	```
	The philosopher puts down the right fork.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n), where n is the number of times each philosopher calls the function.
- **Average Case:** O(n), as each philosopher performs the same number of actions.
- **Worst Case:** O(n), since the system is designed to avoid starvation and deadlock.

The time complexity is linear with respect to the number of iterations each philosopher makes.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(1), since no additional space is required beyond the basic setup.
- **Worst Case:** O(1), as we only need a fixed number of mutexes and variables regardless of input size.

The space complexity is constant as the number of philosophers is fixed and the operations are performed in constant space.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
