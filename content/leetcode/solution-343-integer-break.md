You are given an integer n. Your task is to break it into a sum of at least two positive integers such that the product of these integers is maximized. Return the maximum product that can be obtained.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input is an integer n.
- **Example:** `n = 3`
- **Constraints:**
	- 2 <= n <= 58

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** The output is an integer representing the maximum product that can be achieved by breaking n into the sum of positive integers.
- **Example:** `2`
- **Constraints:**
	- The result is the maximum product of integers summing to n.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** The goal is to find an optimal way to break down n such that the product of the parts is maximized.

- If n is 2 or 3, return the corresponding product values directly.
- For larger values of n, repeatedly subtract 3 from n and multiply by 3 until n becomes less than or equal to 4.
- Finally, multiply the remaining value of n with the accumulated product.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The input n is a valid positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `n = 3`  \
  **Explanation:** Breaking 3 into 2 + 1 yields a product of 2.

- **Input:** `n = 12`  \
  **Explanation:** Breaking 12 into 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 yields a product of 81.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
To solve the problem, we aim to break down the integer into parts where the product is maximized, using a greedy approach.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The maximum product can be achieved by breaking n into as many 3's as possible.
- The product of 3's is optimal, so we should subtract 3 from n repeatedly until n becomes smaller than or equal to 4.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- The input will always be a valid positive integer, so no need to handle empty inputs.
- The solution must handle n values up to 58 efficiently.
- When n equals 2 or 3, the result is directly 1 and 2 respectively.
- The solution must be optimized for n values within the given range.

## Code üíª
```cpp
int integerBreak(int n) {
    if(n == 2) return 1;
    if(n == 3) return 2;
    int product = 1;
    while(n > 4) {
        product *= 3;
        n -= 3;
    }
    product *= n;
    return product;
}
```

This function solves the Integer Break problem by breaking the integer `n` into the sum of at least two positive integers, and returning the maximum product of these integers. The function optimally breaks the number using 3s and handles edge cases for small values of `n`.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int integerBreak(int n) {
	```
	Define the function `integerBreak` which takes an integer `n` and returns the maximum product of integers that sum up to `n`.

2. **Base Case**
	```cpp
	    if(n == 2) return 1;
	```
	If `n` is 2, the only possible integer break is 1 + 1, and the maximum product is 1.

3. **Base Case**
	```cpp
	    if(n == 3) return 2;
	```
	If `n` is 3, the only possible integer break is 2 + 1, and the maximum product is 2.

4. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int product = 1;
	```
	Initialize a variable `product` to 1, which will store the product of the integers as the function progresses.

5. **Looping**
	```cpp
	    while(n > 4) {
	```
	Start a loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 4, ensuring that the remaining number can be divided into parts of 3.

6. **Multiplication**
	```cpp
	        product *= 3;
	```
	Multiply the current `product` by 3, as breaking the number into parts of 3 maximizes the product.

7. **Subtraction**
	```cpp
	        n -= 3;
	```
	Subtract 3 from `n` since we are using 3s to maximize the product.

8. **Final Multiplication**
	```cpp
	    product *= n;
	```
	If `n` is now less than or equal to 4, multiply the remaining value of `n` with `product` to complete the integer break.

9. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return product;
	```
	Return the final computed `product` which is the maximum product for the integer break of `n`.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Average Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

The time complexity is constant since the solution involves simple arithmetic operations.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

The space complexity is constant as we only use a few variables.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
