Design a data structure that simulates a circular double-ended queue (deque) with a fixed maximum size. Implement the MyCircularDeque class with methods for inserting, deleting, and accessing elements at both ends of the deque.

{{< dots >}}
### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input consists of multiple operations to be executed on the deque. Each operation is an array with the first element being the method name and the following elements representing the arguments.
- **Example:** `["MyCircularDeque", "insertLast", "insertLast", "insertFront", "insertFront", "getRear", "isFull", "deleteLast", "insertFront", "getFront"]`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= k <= 1000
	- 0 <= value <= 1000
	- At most 2000 calls will be made to the methods.

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** For each method call, return the result of the operation. If the operation is successful, return a boolean value. For 'getFront' and 'getRear', return the respective item, or -1 if the deque is empty.
- **Example:** `[null, true, true, true, false, 2, true, true, true, 4]`
- **Constraints:**
	- Each 'insert' and 'delete' operation is O(1).
	- The deque will only store integer values.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** To simulate the operations of a circular double-ended queue and ensure the correct results are returned for each operation.

- Initialize the deque with a fixed size.
- Use two pointers (front and back) to track the positions of the front and rear elements.
- Ensure that operations like insertions, deletions, and retrievals are handled efficiently with modulo arithmetic to maintain the circular nature.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The deque will always handle the insert and delete operations correctly based on its current state.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `["MyCircularDeque", "insertLast", "insertLast", "insertFront", "insertFront", "getRear", "isFull", "deleteLast", "insertFront", "getFront"]`  \
  **Explanation:** This example shows the correct sequence of operations on a circular deque, handling insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements with a fixed size.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
We can implement the circular deque using an array with two pointers (front and back), ensuring efficient insertions and deletions at both ends by updating the pointers using modulo arithmetic.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- A circular array can efficiently handle the required operations.
- The modulo operation helps to wrap around the array when inserting or deleting elements.
- We can use a fixed-size array and two pointers to simulate the circular behavior.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- Ensure that operations like 'getFront' and 'getRear' handle an empty deque correctly by returning -1.
- Ensure the solution works efficiently for the largest possible size of the deque and the maximum number of operations.
- Consider cases where the deque is full or empty before performing operations.
- The implementation should be able to handle up to 2000 operations efficiently.

## Code üíª
```cpp
int frd, bck;
int sz, cnt;
public:
MyCircularDeque(int k) : sz(k), buf(k, 0), bck(0), frd(k - 1), cnt(0) {
    
}

bool insertFront(int value) {
    if(isFull()) return false;
    
    buf[frd] = value;
    frd = (frd -1 + sz) % sz;
    
    ++cnt;
    return true;
}

bool insertLast(int value) {
    if(isFull()) return false;
    
    buf[bck] = value;        
    bck = (bck + 1) % sz;
    
    ++cnt;
    return true;        
}

bool deleteFront() {
    if(isEmpty()) return false;
    
    frd = (frd + 1) % sz;
    
    --cnt;
    return true;        
}

bool deleteLast() {
    if(isEmpty()) return false;
    
    bck = (bck - 1 + sz) % sz;
    
    --cnt;
    return true;        
}

int getFront() {
    if(isEmpty()) return -1;
    
    return buf[(frd + 1) % sz];
    
}

int getRear() {
    if(isEmpty()) return -1;
    
    return buf[(bck - 1 + sz) % sz];
}

bool isEmpty() {
    return cnt == 0;
}

bool isFull() {
    return  cnt == sz;
}
};

/**
 * Your MyCircularDeque object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyCircularDeque* obj = new MyCircularDeque(k);
 * bool param_1 = obj->insertFront(value);
 * bool param_2 = obj->insertLast(value);
 * bool param_3 = obj->deleteFront();
 * bool param_4 = obj->deleteLast();
 * int param_5 = obj->getFront();
 * int param_6 = obj->getRear();
 * bool param_7 = obj->isEmpty();
 * bool param_8 = obj->isFull();
```

This is the complete code for implementing a circular deque, with functions to insert elements at the front and back, delete elements from the front and back, and check if the deque is empty or full.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Average Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

Each operation (insert, delete, get) is performed in constant time due to the circular nature of the deque.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(k)
- **Worst Case:** O(k)

The space complexity is O(k) where k is the maximum size of the deque, as we need to store up to k elements.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
