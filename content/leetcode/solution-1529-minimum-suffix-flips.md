You are given a binary string `target` and another string `s` initialized to all zeros. In one operation, you can flip all bits in the inclusive range starting from index `i` to `n-1`. The task is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to make `s` equal to `target`.

### Input Representations 📥
- **Input:** A binary string `target` of length `n`.
- **Example:** `target = '10010'`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= n <= 10^5
	- target[i] is either '0' or '1'.

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications 📤
- **Output:** Return the minimum number of operations required to make `s` equal to `target`.
- **Example:** `For target = '10010', the output is 3.`
- **Constraints:**
	- The output is the minimum number of operations required.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic 🔍
**Goal:** Minimize the number of operations by choosing the correct index `i` to flip bits.

- Start with the string `s` initialized to all zeros.
- Iterate over the `target` string, flipping bits only when needed to match the target.
- Count the number of flip operations required.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ✅
- The string `s` is initially all zeros.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples 🧩
- **Input:** `target = '10010'`  \
  **Explanation:** We need to perform 3 operations to transform the string `s = '00000'` to the target `10010`.

- **Input:** `target = '110'`  \
  **Explanation:** 2 operations are enough to transform `s = '000'` to `110`.

## Approach 🚀
The solution involves flipping the bits of `s` strategically to match `target` while minimizing the number of operations.

### Initial Thoughts 💭
- We only flip bits when the bit in `s` doesn't match `target`.
- We can track the changes in the string `s` while iterating through `target` and perform flips only when necessary.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases 🌐
- No empty string inputs as `n >= 1`.
- The solution should be efficient enough to handle up to 10^5 characters.
- If `target` is already equal to `s`, no flips are needed.
- The solution should work within the given time and space constraints.

## Code 💻
```cpp
int minFlips(string target) {
    int flips = 0;
    char status = '0';
    for(int i = 0; i < target.size(); i++) {
        if(status != target[i]) {
            flips++;
            status = status == '0'? '1':'0';
        }
    }
    return flips;
}
```

The function `minFlips` calculates the minimum number of flips required to convert a binary string to the target binary string. The function iterates through the string and counts the flips needed when the `status` doesn't match the target character.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown 🛠️
1. **Function Declaration**
	```cpp
	int minFlips(string target) {
	```
	This line declares the function `minFlips`, which takes a string `target` and returns an integer representing the minimum number of flips needed to convert a binary string to match the `target` string.

2. **Initialize Flips Counter**
	```cpp
	    int flips = 0;
	```
	The variable `flips` is initialized to zero. It will count the number of flips required to match the target binary string.

3. **Initialize Status**
	```cpp
	    char status = '0';
	```
	The `status` variable is initialized to '0', representing the starting state of the binary string. This will be compared to each character in the `target` string to determine if a flip is required.

4. **Iterate Over Target String**
	```cpp
	    for(int i = 0; i < target.size(); i++) {
	```
	This loop iterates through the `target` string, checking each character to see if a flip is required to match the `status`.

5. **Check for Flip Condition**
	```cpp
	        if(status != target[i]) {
	```
	This condition checks if the current `status` (either '0' or '1') does not match the character at `target[i]`. If they don't match, it means a flip is needed.

6. **Increment Flip Counter**
	```cpp
	            flips++;
	```
	If a flip is required, the `flips` counter is incremented.

7. **Toggle Status**
	```cpp
	            status = status == '0'? '1':'0';
	```
	This line toggles the `status` variable. If the current `status` is '0', it changes to '1', and vice versa. This simulates the flipping process.

8. **Return Result**
	```cpp
	    return flips;
	```
	The function returns the total number of flips (`flips`) required to convert the initial binary string (starting with '0') to match the target binary string.

## Complexity Analysis 📊
### Time Complexity ⏳
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Average Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The solution requires one pass through the string, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

### Space Complexity 💾
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

The space complexity is O(1) as we are only using a constant amount of extra space.
