### Problem Statement

The task is to determine the minimum number of flips required to convert a binary string consisting of only '0's and '1's into a target binary string. A flip changes a '0' to a '1' or vice versa. The challenge lies in finding the minimum number of such operations needed to achieve the desired target string from an initial string of all '0's.

For example, if the target string is "101", we start from "000" and need to flip the first character to '1', then flip the second character to '0', and finally flip the third character to '1'. This results in a total of 3 flips.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize a straightforward strategy that involves a single pass through the target string. Here’s the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialization**: Start with a variable to count flips, initialized to zero. Set an initial character status (representing the current state of the binary string) to '0' since we start with all '0's.

2. **Iterate Through Target String**: Loop through each character in the target string:
   - Whenever the current character in the target string differs from the current status, a flip is needed. Increment the flip counter and update the current status to reflect the flipped character.

3. **Return the Result**: The final count of flips after examining the entire target string will be the result.

This approach effectively counts the transitions between '0' and '1' in the target string, as each transition signifies a required flip.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the code provided:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(string target) {
        int flips = 0;  // Step 1: Initialize flips counter
        char status = '0';  // Step 2: Start with initial status of '0'
```
- We define the `Solution` class and the public method `minFlips`, which takes a binary string `target` as input.
- We initialize a counter `flips` to zero, which will keep track of the number of flips required.
- We set the variable `status` to '0' to represent the starting state of our binary string.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < target.size(); i++) {
            if(status != target[i]) {  // Step 3: Check for flip condition
                flips++;  // Increment flip counter
                status = status == '0'? '1':'0';  // Update status
            }
        }
```
- We start a loop that goes through each character of the `target` string.
- Inside the loop, we check if the current character in `target` differs from the current `status`:
  - If they are different, we have identified a required flip, so we increment the `flips` counter.
  - We then update `status` to the opposite character (if it was '0', we change it to '1', and vice versa). This reflects the current state of the binary string after the flip.

```cpp
        return flips;  // Step 4: Return the total number of flips
    }
};
```
- After iterating through the entire target string, we return the total count of flips.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the target string. This is because we perform a single pass through the string to count the necessary flips.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are using only a constant amount of space for the flip counter and the status variable, regardless of the input size.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently determines the minimum number of flips required to transform a binary string of all '0's into a given target string using a simple and effective approach. By counting transitions between '0' and '1', we can quickly compute the number of flips needed.

**Key Insights**:
- **Single Pass Algorithm**: The approach relies on a single iteration over the target string, which is optimal for this problem.
- **State Tracking**: By maintaining a state variable (`status`), we can easily determine when a flip is required, allowing us to minimize unnecessary computations.
- **Clarity and Efficiency**: The simplicity of the solution contributes to both its clarity and efficiency, making it easy to understand and implement.

Overall, the method demonstrated here can be broadly applied to similar problems involving binary strings, and it highlights the importance of efficiently tracking state changes within a sequence.
