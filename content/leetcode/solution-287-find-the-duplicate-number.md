### ðŸš€ Problem Statement

We're tasked with finding the **duplicate number** in an integer array `nums` containing `n + 1` numbers, with each number ranging between `1` and `n`. The catch? **Don't modify the array**, and aim for **constant extra space**.

For example:
- **Input:** `nums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]`
- **Output:** `2`

The duplicate here is `2` because it appears more than once. Ready to solve it? Let's go!

### ðŸ§  Approach: Cycle Detection with a Twist

Weâ€™ll use a clever approach known as **Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare algorithm** (a.k.a. Cycle Detection). Imagine each number in the array pointing to the next "index," like links in a chain. Since there's a duplicate, this "chain" forms a **cycle**!

Our goal is to detect the start of this cycle, which corresponds to the duplicate number. Hereâ€™s the plan:

1. **Phase 1 (Detect the Cycle):** Use two pointersâ€”a **slow** pointer and a **fast** pointer.
2. **Phase 2 (Find the Duplicate):** After detecting the cycle, reset one pointer and advance both pointers step-by-step to find where they meet again. This meeting point is our duplicate.

---

### ðŸ”¨ Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

#### Step 1: Initialize Slow and Fast Pointers
```cpp
int slow = nums[0], fast = nums[nums[0]];
```
- We start `slow` at `nums[0]` and `fast` at `nums[nums[0]]` to establish a cycle-tracing setup.

#### Step 2: Detect the Cycle
```cpp
while(slow != fast) {
    slow = nums[slow];
    fast = nums[nums[fast]];
}
```
- **Slow pointer** moves one step (`slow = nums[slow]`), while the **fast pointer** moves two steps (`fast = nums[nums[fast]]`).
- When they meet, a cycle is detected. (ðŸŽ‰ Weâ€™re halfway there!)

#### Step 3: Find the Duplicate (Cycle Start)
```cpp
fast = 0;
while(slow != fast) {
    slow = nums[slow];
    fast = nums[fast];
}
return fast;
```
- Reset `fast` to the beginning, then move both pointers one step at a time.
- When they meet again, both `slow` and `fast` will point to the duplicate numberâ€”the start of the cycle. **Voila!**

### ðŸ“ˆ Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)** â€“ Both pointers traverse the array linearly, resulting in **O(n)** time complexity.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)** â€“ Only two extra pointers are used, ensuring constant space usage.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion

This solution brilliantly finds the duplicate in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space using cycle detection. It leverages the duplicate-induced "cycle" in the array structure to identify the duplicate efficiently. 

**Takeaways:**
- **Time Efficient**: Only one pass through the array is needed.
- **Space Efficient**: No extra arrays, just two pointers.
- **Cycle Detection Mastery**: Understanding this approach opens up new ways to handle cycle-related problems.

Keep up the great work! With techniques like this, you're building a powerful foundation in problem-solving! ðŸŒŸ
