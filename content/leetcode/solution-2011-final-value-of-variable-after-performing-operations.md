In a simplified programming language, there are only four operations: incrementing or decrementing a variable X by 1. You are given a list of operations that can either increment or decrement the value of X. Your task is to determine the final value of X after applying all the operations.

{{< dots >}}
### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** You are given an array of strings, where each string represents an operation on the variable X. The operations can be any of the following: '++X', 'X++', '--X', or 'X--'. Initially, X is set to 0.
- **Example:** `operations = ["X++", "--X", "++X"]`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= operations.length <= 100
	- operations[i] will be either '++X', 'X++', '--X', or 'X--'.

### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the final value of X after performing all operations.
- **Example:** `Output: 1`
- **Constraints:**
	- The output will be an integer.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** The goal is to calculate the final value of X after applying all the operations sequentially.

- Start with X initialized to 0.
- Iterate through each operation in the list.
- For each operation, update the value of X accordingly: increment if the operation is '++X' or 'X++', decrement if the operation is '--X' or 'X--'.
- Return the final value of X.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The initial value of X is 0.
- The operations are applied in the order they appear in the list.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `Example 1: Input: operations = ["X++", "--X", "++X"]`  \
  **Explanation:** The operations are applied as follows: X = 0 initially. 'X++' increments X to 1, '--X' decrements X to 0, '++X' increments X to 1. The final value of X is 1.

- **Input:** `Example 2: Input: operations = ["++X", "++X", "X++"]`  \
  **Explanation:** The operations are applied as follows: X = 0 initially. '++X' increments X to 1, '++X' increments X to 2, 'X++' increments X to 3. The final value of X is 3.

- **Input:** `Example 3: Input: operations = ["X++", "--X", "X--"]`  \
  **Explanation:** The operations are applied as follows: X = 0 initially. 'X++' increments X to 1, '--X' decrements X to 0, 'X--' decrements X to -1. The final value of X is -1.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
We can simply iterate over the operations list, update the value of X based on each operation, and return the final value.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The operations only involve simple increments and decrements of X.
- The operations are applied in sequence, and each operation affects the value of X directly.
- Since the operations are straightforward and independent, we can solve this problem using a simple loop to apply each operation sequentially.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- The input array will never be empty, as per the constraints.
- The solution should handle the maximum input size of 100 operations efficiently.
- The initial value of X is always 0.
- Ensure that the operations are valid as per the given constraints.

## Code üíª
```cpp
int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) 
{
    int X = 0;
    for(int i=0;i<operations.size();i++)
    {
        if(operations[i]=="X++")
        {
            X++;
        }
        else if(operations[i] == "++X")
        {
            ++X;
        }
        else if(operations[i] == "X--")
        {
            X--;
        }
        else if(operations[i] == "--X")
        {
            --X;
        }
    }
    return X;
}
```

This code calculates the final value of X after performing a series of increment or decrement operations defined in the `operations` vector.

{{< dots >}}
### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) 
	```
	Defines the function `finalValueAfterOperations` that takes a vector of strings representing operations and returns the final value of `X`.

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int X = 0;
	```
	Initializes the variable `X` to 0, which will hold the result of the operations.

3. **Loop Initialization**
	```cpp
	    for(int i=0;i<operations.size();i++)
	```
	Starts a for loop to iterate over each operation in the `operations` vector.

4. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	        if(operations[i]=="X++")
	```
	Checks if the current operation is `X++`, which increments `X`.

5. **Increment Operation**
	```cpp
	            X++;
	```
	Increments the value of `X` by 1.

6. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	        else if(operations[i] == "++X")
	```
	Checks if the current operation is `++X`, which also increments `X`.

7. **Increment Operation**
	```cpp
	            ++X;
	```
	Increments `X` by 1 before returning the value.

8. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	        else if(operations[i] == "X--")
	```
	Checks if the current operation is `X--`, which decrements `X`.

9. **Decrement Operation**
	```cpp
	            X--;
	```
	Decrements `X` by 1.

10. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	        else if(operations[i] == "--X")
	```
	Checks if the current operation is `--X`, which also decrements `X`.

11. **Decrement Operation**
	```cpp
	            --X;
	```
	Decrements `X` by 1 before returning the value.

12. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return X;
	```
	Returns the final value of `X` after all operations have been performed.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n), where n is the number of operations.
- **Average Case:** O(n), where n is the number of operations.
- **Worst Case:** O(n), where n is the number of operations.

The time complexity is linear because we need to process each operation once.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(1), as the space requirement does not depend on the input size.
- **Worst Case:** O(1), as we only need a constant amount of space to store the value of X.

The space complexity is constant because we only store the value of X.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
