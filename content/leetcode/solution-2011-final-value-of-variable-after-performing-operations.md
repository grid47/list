### Problem Statement

The task at hand is to evaluate a sequence of operations that modify a variable `X`, which starts at zero. The operations are represented as strings and include incrementing or decrementing `X` in various forms. The operations are as follows:

- `X++`: Increment `X` after the current value is used.
- `++X`: Increment `X` before the current value is used.
- `X--`: Decrement `X` after the current value is used.
- `--X`: Decrement `X` before the current value is used.

Given an array of these operation strings, the objective is to compute the final value of `X` after applying all the operations sequentially.

For example, if the input is `operations = ["++X", "X++", "X--", "--X"]`, we should evaluate each operation in order to find out the final value of `X`.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a straightforward iterative approach:

1. **Initialization**: Start with a variable `X` initialized to zero.
2. **Iterate through Operations**: Loop through each operation string in the provided list:
   - If the operation is `X++` or `++X`, increment `X`.
   - If the operation is `X--` or `--X`, decrement `X`.
3. **Return Result**: After processing all operations, return the final value of `X`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Letâ€™s analyze the code and see how it implements this approach:

1. **Class Definition**: We define a class called `Solution`, which encapsulates the logic for our solution.

    ```cpp
    class Solution {
    public:
    ```

2. **Method Declaration**: We declare a public method named `finalValueAfterOperations`, which takes a vector of strings representing the operations and returns an integer.

    ```cpp
    int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) 
    ```

3. **Variable Initialization**: Inside the method, we initialize a variable `X` to zero, which will hold the result of the operations.

    ```cpp
    int X = 0;
    ```

4. **Iterating through Operations**: We use a for loop to iterate through the `operations` vector.

    ```cpp
    for(int i=0; i<operations.size(); i++)
    ```

5. **Operation Evaluation**: For each operation, we check the string and modify `X` accordingly:

    - If the operation is `X++`, we increment `X` by 1.

        ```cpp
        if(operations[i] == "X++") {
            X++;
        }
        ```

    - If the operation is `++X`, we also increment `X` by 1. The difference between `X++` and `++X` in this context is negligible for our final result.

        ```cpp
        else if(operations[i] == "++X") {
            ++X;
        }
        ```

    - If the operation is `X--`, we decrement `X` by 1.

        ```cpp
        else if(operations[i] == "X--") {
            X--;
        }
        ```

    - If the operation is `--X`, we also decrement `X` by 1.

        ```cpp
        else if(operations[i] == "--X") {
            --X;
        }
        ```

6. **Return Final Value**: After processing all operations, we return the final value of `X`.

    ```cpp
    return X;
    }
    ```

### Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the number of operations in the input array. This is because we process each operation exactly once. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of additional space to store the variable `X`.

### Conclusion

In summary, the code effectively implements a simple iterative solution to determine the final value of `X` after a series of increment and decrement operations. This problem emphasizes the importance of understanding how operations affect a variable and provides a clear example of how straightforward logical checks can be implemented in programming.

This implementation is efficient, easy to understand, and serves as a solid basis for tackling similar problems involving sequences of operations. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about control structures and operations in programming or an experienced developer refreshing your knowledge, this example offers valuable insights into basic algorithm design and implementation. The clarity of the logic and simplicity of the solution make it a great reference for similar coding challenges.
