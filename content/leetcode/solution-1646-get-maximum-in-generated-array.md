Given an integer n, an array nums of length n+1 is generated with the following rules:

- nums[0] = 0
- nums[1] = 1
- nums[2 * i] = nums[i] when 2 <= 2 * i <= n
- nums[2 * i + 1] = nums[i] + nums[i + 1] when 2 <= 2 * i + 1 <= n

Return the maximum value in the array nums.

### Input Representations 📥
- **Input:** An integer n.
- **Example:** `n = 6`
- **Constraints:**
	- 0 <= n <= 100

### Output Specifications 📤
- **Output:** Return the maximum integer in the generated array.
- **Example:** `Output: 3`
- **Constraints:**

### Core Logic 🔍
**Goal:** Generate the array nums based on the given rules and find the maximum integer in the array.

- Initialize an array nums of length n+1.
- Iterate through the array to generate values based on the given rules.
- Return the maximum value in the array.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ✅
- The input integer n will always be a valid non-negative integer.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples 🧩
- **Input:** `n = 6`  \
  **Explanation:** Following the given rules, the array nums is generated as [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2], and the maximum value in the array is 3.

## Approach 🚀
To solve this problem, generate the array nums using the rules provided and track the maximum value while populating the array.

### Initial Thoughts 💭
- We need to iterate through the array and fill in the values based on specific conditions.
- We will need to calculate and compare the values as we go.
- The problem can be solved in linear time by iterating once through the array and maintaining the maximum value.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases 🌐
- If n = 0, the array will only contain one element, which is 0.
- For the maximum value of n = 100, the solution should handle the array efficiently.
- When n = 1, the array will be [0, 1], and the maximum will be 1.
- Ensure that the array size does not exceed the constraints given (n <= 100).

## Code 💻
```cpp
class Solution {
public int getMaximumGenerated(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    int[] nums = new int[n + 1];
    nums[0] = 0;
    nums[1] = 1;
    int max = 1;
    for(int i = 1; 2 * i + 1 < n + 1; i++) {
        nums[2 * i]     = nums[i];
        max = Math.max(nums[2 * i],     max);
        nums[2 * i + 1] = nums[i] + nums[i + 1];
        max = Math.max(nums[2 * i + 1], max);
    }
    return max;
}
```

This function generates a sequence of numbers based on a given integer `n` and calculates the maximum value in that sequence. The sequence is generated by following a specific pattern where every element at index `2*i` is the same as the element at index `i`, and the element at index `2*i + 1` is the sum of elements at index `i` and `i+1`. The maximum value is tracked throughout the process.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown 🛠️
1. **Class Definition**
	```cpp
	class Solution {
	```
	This defines a class named `Solution`, which contains the method to compute the maximum value generated by the sequence.

2. **Method Definition**
	```cpp
	public int getMaximumGenerated(int n) {
	```
	This line defines the method `getMaximumGenerated` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the maximum value in the generated sequence.

3. **Base Case Check**
	```cpp
	    if (n == 0) return 0;
	```
	If `n` is 0, the function returns 0 because the generated sequence has no elements.

4. **Array Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int[] nums = new int[n + 1];
	```
	An array `nums` is initialized with `n+1` elements to store the generated sequence.

5. **Base Case Assignment**
	```cpp
	    nums[0] = 0;
	```
	The first element of the sequence is set to 0, as per the problem definition.

6. **Base Case Assignment**
	```cpp
	    nums[1] = 1;
	```
	The second element of the sequence is set to 1, as per the problem definition.

7. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int max = 1;
	```
	The variable `max` is initialized to 1, which will track the maximum value encountered in the sequence.

8. **Loop**
	```cpp
	    for(int i = 1; 2 * i + 1 < n + 1; i++) {
	```
	A loop starts to iterate from index 1 to generate the sequence values until `2*i + 1` exceeds `n`.

9. **Sequence Generation**
	```cpp
	        nums[2 * i] = nums[i];
	```
	The element at index `2*i` is assigned the value of `nums[i]`, following the pattern defined in the problem.

10. **Max Update**
	```cpp
	        max = Math.max(nums[2 * i], max);
	```
	The maximum value is updated if the value at `nums[2*i]` is greater than the current `max`.

11. **Sequence Generation**
	```cpp
	        nums[2 * i + 1] = nums[i] + nums[i + 1];
	```
	The element at index `2*i + 1` is assigned the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]`, as per the pattern.

12. **Max Update**
	```cpp
	        max = Math.max(nums[2 * i + 1], max);
	```
	The maximum value is updated again if the value at `nums[2*i + 1]` is greater than the current `max`.

13. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return max;
	```
	The method returns the maximum value found in the sequence.

## Complexity Analysis 📊
### Time Complexity ⏳
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Average Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The solution iterates through the array once to generate the values and track the maximum.

### Space Complexity 💾
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the nums array.
