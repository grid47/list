You are given an array `nums` where each element represents the number of balls in a bag. You can perform up to `maxOperations` operations, where each operation consists of splitting one bag of balls into two smaller bags. Each new bag must contain a positive number of balls. The goal is to minimize the maximum number of balls in any bag after performing the operations.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input consists of an integer array `nums`, representing the number of balls in each bag, and an integer `maxOperations`, which is the maximum number of operations you can perform.
- **Example:** `Input: nums = [7, 10], maxOperations = 3`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
	- 1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 10^9

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the minimum possible maximum number of balls in any bag after performing the operations, modulo 10^9 + 7.
- **Example:** `Output: 4`
- **Constraints:**
	- The result should be modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** The goal is to minimize the maximum number of balls in any bag after performing the allowed number of operations.

- 1. Perform a binary search over the possible maximum number of balls in a bag, starting from 1 to the maximum value in the `nums` array.
- 2. For each candidate maximum, count the number of operations needed to achieve this maximum for all bags.
- 3. If the number of operations required is less than or equal to `maxOperations`, it is possible to achieve this maximum, so continue searching for a smaller maximum.
- 4. Return the minimum maximum number of balls that can be achieved.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- All elements in the `nums` array are positive integers.
- The number of operations `maxOperations` is positive and within bounds.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `Input: nums = [7, 10], maxOperations = 3`  \
  **Explanation:** You can divide the bag with 10 balls into two bags with 5 and 5 balls. The maximum number of balls in any bag is 5. With one more operation, you can divide a bag of 7 balls into two bags with 4 and 3 balls. The final maximum number of balls in a bag is 4.

- **Input:** `Input: nums = [2, 3, 5], maxOperations = 2`  \
  **Explanation:** You can divide the bag with 5 balls into two bags with 3 and 2 balls, and then divide the bag with 3 balls into two bags with 2 and 1 balls. The maximum number of balls in any bag is 2.

## Approach üöÄ
The solution involves binary search over the possible maximum number of balls, using a helper function to count how many operations are needed to ensure no bag exceeds this maximum.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The problem is about minimizing the maximum value in a list of bags by splitting them into smaller bags.
- Binary search is an ideal approach to efficiently find the minimum possible maximum number of balls.
- We can try various maximum values and check how many operations are required to achieve that value. The smallest possible maximum that requires no more than `maxOperations` is our answer.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- If `nums` is empty, return 0 since there are no bags.
- Ensure that the binary search and the operation counting function work efficiently for large arrays.
- If all bags contain the same number of balls, no operations are needed, and the penalty is the number of balls in any bag.
- The solution should be efficient for arrays of length up to 10^5.

## Code üíª
```cpp
int minimumSize(vector<int>& nums, int mxOps) {
    
    int l = 1, r = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    // int total_bags = n + 2 * mxOps - 1;
    
    while(l < r) {
        int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
        int cnt = 0;
        for(int a: nums)
            cnt += (a - 1) / mid;
        if(cnt <= mxOps)
            r = mid;
        else
            l = mid + 1;
    }
    return l;
}
```

This function determines the minimum possible maximum bag size after a series of operations to split integers in the vector. It uses binary search to find the optimal value efficiently.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Declaration**
	```cpp
	int minimumSize(vector<int>& nums, int mxOps) {
	```
	Declares a function to minimize the largest bag size given a maximum number of operations.

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int l = 1, r = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
	```
	Initializes the binary search range with `l` as the smallest possible size and `r` as the maximum number in the array.

3. **Binary Search Loop**
	```cpp
	    while(l < r) {
	```
	Begins a binary search loop to find the minimum maximum bag size.

4. **Mid Calculation**
	```cpp
	        int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
	```
	Calculates the middle point to test as the potential maximum bag size.

5. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	        int cnt = 0;
	```
	Initializes the operation counter to track the total number of splits required.

6. **For Loop**
	```cpp
	        for(int a: nums)
	```
	Iterates through each element in the array to calculate the operations required for the current `mid` size.

7. **Operation Calculation**
	```cpp
	            cnt += (a - 1) / mid;
	```
	Calculates the number of operations needed to reduce the current element to the `mid` size or smaller.

8. **Condition Check**
	```cpp
	        if(cnt <= mxOps)
	```
	Checks if the total operations required is within the allowed limit.

9. **Range Update**
	```cpp
	            r = mid;
	```
	Narrows the search range by setting the upper bound to `mid` when the condition is met.

10. **Else Block**
	```cpp
	        else
	```
	Handles the case where the current `mid` size is too small to meet the operation limit.

11. **Range Update**
	```cpp
	            l = mid + 1;
	```
	Narrows the search range by increasing the lower bound when the condition is not met.

12. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return l;
	```
	Returns the smallest possible maximum bag size after applying the allowed operations.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n log(max(nums)))
- **Average Case:** O(n log(max(nums)))
- **Worst Case:** O(n log(max(nums)))

The time complexity is driven by the binary search and the operation counting function, resulting in O(n log(max(nums))) where `n` is the length of the array and `max(nums)` is the maximum number of balls in any bag.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

The space complexity is constant, O(1), since we only need a few variables to track the current state.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
