Given an array of strings `words`, return the longest word in the list that can be built progressively one character at a time by other words in the list.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input consists of an array of strings `words`, where each string represents a word in the dictionary.
- **Example:** `words = ["b", "ba", "ban", "bana", "banana"]`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= words.length <= 1000
	- 1 <= words[i].length <= 30
	- words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the longest word that can be formed progressively from other words in the list. If there is a tie, return the lexicographically smallest word.
- **Example:** `"banana"`
- **Constraints:**
	- The result should be a string representing the longest word that can be progressively built.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** The goal is to identify the longest word that can be formed one character at a time by other words in the list.

- Sort the list of words lexicographically to ensure that we check the smallest words first.
- Use a set to keep track of the words that can be progressively formed.
- For each word, check if it can be formed by adding one character at a time from another word that is already in the set.
- If a word can be formed, update the result if it is longer or lexicographically smaller than the current result.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The list of words is guaranteed to contain at least one word.
- All words are in lowercase English letters.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `words = ["b", "ba", "ban", "bana", "banana"]`  \
  **Explanation:** The word 'banana' can be built progressively from 'b', 'ba', 'ban', and 'bana', making it the longest valid word.

- **Input:** `words = ["d", "do", "dog", "dogs", "dot", "done"]`  \
  **Explanation:** The word 'dog' can be built progressively from 'd' and 'do', whereas 'dogs' cannot be built from any previous word.

## Approach üöÄ
The solution leverages sorting and set operations to efficiently find the longest word that can be built progressively.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- We need to check each word's ability to be progressively built from smaller words.
- Sorting the words helps to check shorter words first, ensuring that we find the longest valid word in lexicographical order.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- If the list is empty, the result should be an empty string.
- Handle cases where the input list contains a large number of words (up to 1000).
- Handle cases where the result is a single character word or where no valid word can be built.
- Ensure that sorting and set operations work efficiently within the problem's constraints.

## Code üíª
```cpp
string longestWord(vector<string>& words) {

    sort(words.begin(),words.end());
    unordered_set<string> mp;
    string res="";
    
    for(string w: words){
        if(w.size() == 1 || mp.count(w.substr(0, w.size() -1))) {
            res = w.size()>res.size()? w:res;
            mp.insert(w);
        }
    }
    return res;
}

```

This function finds the longest word in a dictionary that can be built one character at a time by other words in the dictionary.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	string longestWord(vector<string>& words) {
	```
	Defines the function to find the longest word that meets the criteria.

2. **Sorting**
	```cpp
	    sort(words.begin(),words.end());
	```
	Sorts the words lexicographically to ensure smaller words are processed first.

3. **Data Structure**
	```cpp
	    unordered_set<string> mp;
	```
	Initializes a hash set to store valid prefixes of words.

4. **Initialization**
	```cpp
	    string res="";
	```
	Initializes an empty string to store the result.

5. **Loop**
	```cpp
	    for(string w: words){
	```
	Iterates through each word in the sorted list.

6. **Condition Check**
	```cpp
	        if(w.size() == 1 || mp.count(w.substr(0, w.size() -1))) {
	```
	Checks if the word is a single character or if its prefix exists in the hash set.

7. **Update Result**
	```cpp
	            res = w.size()>res.size()? w:res;
	```
	Updates the result if the current word is longer than the existing result.

8. **Insert**
	```cpp
	            mp.insert(w);
	```
	Adds the current word to the hash set as a valid prefix.

9. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return res;
	```
	Returns the longest word that satisfies the conditions.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n log n) for sorting the words, where n is the number of words.
- **Average Case:** O(n log n) for sorting and O(n * m) for checking each word (n is the number of words, m is the average length of the words).
- **Worst Case:** O(n log n) for sorting and O(n * m) for checking each word.

The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, followed by checking the progressive formation of each word.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(n) for storing the words in a set.
- **Worst Case:** O(n) for storing the words in a set.

The space complexity is O(n) due to the set used for tracking the valid words.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
