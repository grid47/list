You are given a binary string representing a non-negative integer. The task is to determine the number of steps required to reduce this number to 1, following the rules: divide by 2 if the number is even, or add 1 if it is odd. Return the total number of steps required.

### Input Representations 📥
- **Input:** The input is a binary string representing a non-negative integer.
- **Example:** `"1111"`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= s.length <= 500
	- s consists of characters '0' or '1'
	- s[0] == '1'

### Output Specifications 📤
- **Output:** The output is an integer representing the number of steps required to reduce the given number to 1.
- **Example:** `7`
- **Constraints:**
	- The output should be the total number of steps to reduce the number to 1.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic 🔍
**Goal:** The goal is to count how many operations are needed to reduce the number to 1.

- Convert the binary string to a decimal integer.
- For each step, check if the number is odd or even.
- If the number is odd, increment it by 1. If it's even, divide it by 2.
- Keep track of the number of operations until the number becomes 1.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ✅
- The input string is valid and represents a non-negative integer.
- The problem will always have a solution as the number will eventually reduce to 1.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples 🧩
- **Input:** `Input: "1111"`  \
  **Explanation:** The binary representation '1111' corresponds to the number 15. It takes 7 steps to reduce 15 to 1 by following the rules of even and odd operations.

- **Input:** `Input: "100"`  \
  **Explanation:** The binary representation '100' corresponds to the number 4. It takes 3 steps to reduce 4 to 1.

## Approach 🚀
The approach is to repeatedly perform the appropriate operation (add 1 or divide by 2) until the number reaches 1, while counting the steps.

### Initial Thoughts 💭
- We can represent the number as a binary string, which makes it easy to check if the number is odd or even.
- We will simulate the process of reducing the number by performing the required operations, counting each step.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases 🌐
- The string will always have at least one character, as it represents a valid binary number.
- Ensure the solution works for binary strings up to the maximum length of 500 characters.
- What if the binary string is already 1? This case should immediately return 0.
- The solution should be efficient enough to handle up to 500-character long binary strings.

## Code 💻
```cpp
int numSteps(string s) {
    
    int idx = s.size() - 1, cnt = 0;
    
    while(idx > 0) {
        if(s[idx] == '0') {
            cnt++;
            idx--;
        } else {
            int tmp = idx;
            while(idx >= 0 && s[idx] == '1') idx--;
            cnt++; // add one
            if(idx >= 0) {
                s[idx] = '1';
                cnt += (tmp-idx); // divide by 2
            } else {
                cnt += (tmp-idx);
            }
        }
    }
    return cnt;
}
```

This function, `numSteps`, calculates the minimum number of steps required to convert a binary string to a string of all '0's. It performs operations by toggling the binary digits based on specific conditions while iterating over the string from the end.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown 🛠️
1. **Method Definition**
	```cpp
	int numSteps(string s) {
	```
	Defines the method `numSteps`, which takes a binary string `s` and calculates the number of steps to transform it into a string of all '0's.

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int idx = s.size() - 1, cnt = 0;
	```
	Initializes two variables: `idx` to point to the last character of the string and `cnt` to track the number of steps taken.

3. **Loop Start**
	```cpp
	    while(idx > 0) {
	```
	Starts a `while` loop to iterate through the string from the end towards the beginning, as long as `idx` is greater than 0.

4. **Condition Check**
	```cpp
	        if(s[idx] == '0') {
	```
	Checks if the current character is '0'. If so, it increments the step count and moves to the previous character.

5. **Count Increment**
	```cpp
	            cnt++;
	```
	Increments the `cnt` variable by 1 when encountering a '0' at the current index.

6. **Index Decrement**
	```cpp
	            idx--;
	```
	Decrements the `idx` variable to move to the previous character in the string.

7. **Else Block Start**
	```cpp
	        } else {
	```
	Starts the `else` block for handling the case when the current character is '1'.

8. **Temporary Index Save**
	```cpp
	            int tmp = idx;
	```
	Saves the current index (`idx`) to `tmp` before processing the '1' character.

9. **Inner Loop Start**
	```cpp
	            while(idx >= 0 && s[idx] == '1') idx--;
	```
	Moves the `idx` pointer leftward while encountering '1' characters, skipping over consecutive '1's.

10. **Step Increment**
	```cpp
	            cnt++; // add one
	```
	Increments `cnt` by 1 after encountering a '1' and moving past any consecutive '1's.

11. **Check for Index Validity**
	```cpp
	            if(idx >= 0) {
	```
	Checks if there are still remaining characters in the string to process.

12. **Toggle Character**
	```cpp
	                s[idx] = '1';
	```
	Sets the character at the current index to '1', simulating the operation of transforming a '1' into a '0'.

13. **Step Adjustment**
	```cpp
	                cnt += (tmp-idx); // divide by 2
	```
	Adds the difference between the saved index (`tmp`) and the current index (`idx`) to `cnt`, simulating a 'divide by 2' operation.

14. **Else Block End**
	```cpp
	            } else {
	```
	Handles the case where there are no more characters to process in the string.

15. **Final Adjustment**
	```cpp
	                cnt += (tmp-idx);
	```
	Adds the difference between `tmp` and `idx` to `cnt` when the loop ends, finalizing the step count.

16. **Return Result**
	```cpp
	    return cnt;
	```
	Returns the total number of steps (`cnt`) needed to transform the input binary string into a string of all '0's.

## Complexity Analysis 📊
### Time Complexity ⏳
- **Best Case:** O(1), when the input is already '1'.
- **Average Case:** O(n), where n is the length of the binary string.
- **Worst Case:** O(n), as we need to check each bit of the binary string and perform operations.



### Space Complexity 💾
- **Best Case:** O(1), as no extra space is required beyond basic variables.
- **Worst Case:** O(1), since we only need a few variables for the calculation.



**Happy Coding! 🎉**
