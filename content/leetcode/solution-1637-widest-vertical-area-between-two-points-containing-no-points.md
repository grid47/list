### Problem Statement

The task is to find the maximum width of vertical areas formed by a set of points in a 2D plane. Each point is represented by its coordinates \((x, y)\). The width of a vertical area is defined as the horizontal distance between two consecutive points when sorted by their x-coordinates. The goal is to identify the maximum distance between any two adjacent points along the x-axis.

### Approach

To solve the problem, we can use the following approach:

1. **Sorting the Points**: First, we sort the points based on their x-coordinates. This will allow us to easily compute the distances between consecutive points.
2. **Calculating Distances**: After sorting, we iterate through the sorted list and calculate the difference between the x-coordinates of each consecutive pair of points.
3. **Finding the Maximum Width**: As we calculate these distances, we keep track of the maximum width encountered.

This algorithm relies on the properties of sorting to efficiently find the maximum width of vertical areas without needing to check every possible pair of points.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here is a detailed explanation of the provided code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(vector<vector<int>>& pts) {
```
- This line defines the `Solution` class and the method `maxWidthOfVerticalArea`, which takes a vector of points as input. Each point is represented as a vector of integers containing its x and y coordinates.

```cpp
        sort(pts.begin(), pts.end());
```
- The first step in the method is to sort the `pts` vector. The default sorting behavior for a vector of vectors will sort primarily by the first element (the x-coordinate). If two points have the same x-coordinate, they will be sorted by their y-coordinates as a secondary criterion. However, since we are only interested in the x-coordinates for this problem, this is sufficient.

```cpp
        int res = 0;
```
- We initialize a variable `res` to keep track of the maximum width found. It starts at 0 because, initially, we haven't calculated any distances.

```cpp
        for(int i = 1; i < pts.size(); i++)
```
- This line begins a loop that iterates through the sorted points, starting from the second point (index 1) and going to the last point.

```cpp
            res = max(res, pts[i][0] - pts[i - 1][0]);
```
- Inside the loop, we compute the width of the vertical area between the current point `pts[i]` and the previous point `pts[i - 1]`. The width is calculated by taking the difference of their x-coordinates (`pts[i][0] - pts[i - 1][0]`). 
- We then update `res` to be the maximum of its current value and the newly computed width. This ensures that by the end of the loop, `res` will hold the maximum width encountered.

```cpp
        return res;
    }
};
```
- After the loop completes, the method returns the maximum width found, which is stored in `res`.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
    - The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of points. The loop to calculate the maximum width runs in \(O(n)\). Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step.

- **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) beyond the input size since we are only using a fixed amount of additional space for variables (`res` and loop counters).

### Conclusion

The `maxWidthOfVerticalArea` function effectively computes the maximum width of vertical areas formed by a set of points in a 2D plane using a simple and efficient algorithm based on sorting. 

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **Sorting for Efficiency**: Sorting the points simplifies the problem by allowing us to focus only on adjacent points, significantly reducing the complexity of the solution.
2. **Linear Scanning**: Once sorted, a single pass through the points is sufficient to find the maximum width, demonstrating the power of combining sorting with linear traversal.
3. **Practical Application**: This type of problem can be applied in various scenarios, such as finding gaps between buildings or measuring distances in geographical data.

Overall, this solution is a clean and efficient approach to solving the problem of finding the maximum width of vertical areas, leveraging sorting and a simple loop to achieve the desired result.
