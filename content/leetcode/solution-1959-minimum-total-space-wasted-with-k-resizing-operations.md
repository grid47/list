You are tasked with designing a dynamic array where the number of elements that should be in the array at each time is provided in an integer array `nums`. Additionally, you are given an integer `k`, representing the maximum number of times you can resize the array. At each time step, the array‚Äôs size must be large enough to hold the elements in `nums[i]` and any extra space will be wasted. Your goal is to minimize the total wasted space by resizing the array at most `k` times.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input consists of an array `nums` where each `nums[i]` represents the number of elements that need to be in the array at time `i`. You are also given an integer `k` which specifies the maximum number of resizes allowed.
- **Example:** `nums = [15, 25, 10], k = 1`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= nums.length <= 200
	- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
	- 0 <= k <= nums.length - 1

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** The output should be the minimum total space wasted if you can resize the array at most `k` times.
- **Example:** `Output: 5`
- **Constraints:**
	- The array can be resized at most `k` times.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** The objective is to minimize the total wasted space by determining when and how to resize the array optimally.

- Step 1: Start by setting an initial size for the array.
- Step 2: Check the amount of space wasted at each time step based on the current size and the number of elements required.
- Step 3: Resize the array up to `k` times if it reduces the total wasted space.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The input array will always be valid with non-negative values.
- The number of resizes will not exceed the length of the array minus one.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `Input: nums = [15, 25, 10], k = 1`  \
  **Explanation:** In this case, the initial array size could be set to 25 to accommodate the first two values, and a resize can be made at time 3 to accommodate the value 10. The total wasted space is 5.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
The approach is to start by choosing an initial size for the array and then check the space wasted at each step. The key to minimizing wasted space is to resize the array optimally and avoid unnecessary resizes.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- Resizing too frequently could increase wasted space, but resizing too infrequently may result in larger wasted space.
- The problem is about finding a balance between resizing the array and minimizing wasted space at each step.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- There will always be at least one element in the `nums` array.
- Ensure that the solution works efficiently for the maximum input size.
- Consider scenarios where no resizes are needed, i.e., `k = 0`.
- The number of resizes will be constrained to `k` times.

## Code üíª
```cpp

int n;
vector<int> nums;
int memo[201][200];
int dp(int k, int idx) {
    if(idx == n) return 0;
    if(k == 0) return INT_MAX;

    if(memo[k][idx] != -1) return memo[k][idx];
    
    int ans = INT_MAX, sum = 0, mx = nums[idx];
    for(int j = idx; j < n; j++) {
        mx = max(mx, nums[j]);
        sum += nums[j];
        int wasted = mx * (j - idx + 1) - sum;
        int res = dp(k - 1, j + 1);
        ans = min(ans, wasted + (res == INT_MAX? INT_MAX - wasted: res));
    }
    
    return memo[k][idx] = ans;
}

int minSpaceWastedKResizing(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    n = nums.size();
    this->nums = nums;
    memset(memo, -1, sizeof(memo));
    return dp(k + 1, 0);
}
```

This function defines a dynamic programming approach to minimize space wasted when resizing a vector of integers. It uses memoization to store previously computed results and explores all possible partitions.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Initialization**
	```cpp
	
	```
	Initializing variables for the dynamic programming function.

2. **Variable Declaration**
	```cpp
	int n;
	```
	Declare variable n to store the size of the input vector nums.

3. **Vector Declaration**
	```cpp
	vector<int> nums;
	```
	Declare a vector nums to store the input integers.

4. **Array Declaration**
	```cpp
	int memo[201][200];
	```
	Declare a 2D array memo for memoization, to store the results of subproblems.

5. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int dp(int k, int idx) {
	```
	Define the recursive function dp, which calculates the minimum space wasted given k partitions and the current index.

6. **Base Case**
	```cpp
	    if(idx == n) return 0;
	```
	Base case: if the index has reached the end of the array, return 0 since there is no remaining space.

7. **Base Case**
	```cpp
	    if(k == 0) return INT_MAX;
	```
	Base case: if no partitions are allowed, return a large number to signify an invalid case.

8. **Memoization Check**
	```cpp
	
	```
	Check if the result for the current state (k, idx) has already been computed.

9. **Memoization Check**
	```cpp
	    if(memo[k][idx] != -1) return memo[k][idx];
	```
	Return the precomputed result from the memoization array if it exists.

10. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int ans = INT_MAX, sum = 0, mx = nums[idx];
	```
	Initialize variables: ans stores the minimum space wasted, sum tracks the current sum, and mx stores the maximum value in the current partition.

11. **Loop**
	```cpp
	    for(int j = idx; j < n; j++) {
	```
	Iterate over all possible ending indices for the current partition.

12. **Max Calculation**
	```cpp
	        mx = max(mx, nums[j]);
	```
	Update the maximum value in the current partition.

13. **Sum Calculation**
	```cpp
	        sum += nums[j];
	```
	Add the current element to the sum for the current partition.

14. **Wasted Space Calculation**
	```cpp
	        int wasted = mx * (j - idx + 1) - sum;
	```
	Calculate the wasted space for the current partition by comparing the area that would be taken by the max value with the actual sum.

15. **Recursive Call**
	```cpp
	        int res = dp(k - 1, j + 1);
	```
	Recursively call dp to calculate the result for the remaining partitions after the current partition.

16. **Result Calculation**
	```cpp
	        ans = min(ans, wasted + (res == INT_MAX? INT_MAX - wasted: res));
	```
	Update the minimum answer by considering the wasted space for the current partition and the result from the recursive call.

17. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return memo[k][idx] = ans;
	```
	Store and return the result for the current state (k, idx) to avoid redundant calculations.

18. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int minSpaceWastedKResizing(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
	```
	Define the function to find the minimum space wasted after resizing the vector with k partitions.

19. **Vector Initialization**
	```cpp
	    n = nums.size();
	```
	Initialize n with the size of the input vector.

20. **Vector Assignment**
	```cpp
	    this->nums = nums;
	```
	Assign the input vector nums to the member variable nums.

21. **Memoization Setup**
	```cpp
	    memset(memo, -1, sizeof(memo));
	```
	Set all entries in the memo array to -1 to signify that no subproblems have been solved yet.

22. **Return Result**
	```cpp
	    return dp(k + 1, 0);
	```
	Call the dp function with k + 1 partitions and starting from index 0, and return the result.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Average Case:** O(n^2)
- **Worst Case:** O(n^2)

The worst case involves checking every possible combination of resizes, which leads to a time complexity of O(n^2).

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n*k)

The space complexity is proportional to the number of resizes and the length of the array.
