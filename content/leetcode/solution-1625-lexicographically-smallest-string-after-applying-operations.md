Given a string s of even length consisting of digits from 0 to 9, and two integers a and b, return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by applying two operations any number of times: adding a to all odd indices of s (with wrapping) and rotating s to the right by b positions.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** You are given a string s of even length, containing digits from 0 to 9, and two integers a and b.
- **Example:** `s = "3637", a = 7, b = 2`
- **Constraints:**
	- 2 <= s.length <= 100
	- s.length is even.
	- s consists of digits from 0 to 9 only.
	- 1 <= a <= 9
	- 1 <= b <= s.length - 1

### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by applying the two operations any number of times, in any order.
- **Example:** `Output: "3036"`
- **Constraints:**
	- The output should be a string of the same length as s.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string after applying the operations any number of times.

- Apply rotations to s in all possible ways to generate different versions of s.
- For each version, apply the addition operation on odd indices of s.
- Track the lexicographically smallest result by comparing the modified strings.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The input string s will always have even length and consist of digits from 0 to 9.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `s = "3637", a = 7, b = 2`  \
  **Explanation:** By rotating the string twice and adding 7 to odd positions, we get the smallest possible string, which is "3036".

- **Input:** `s = "9783", a = 3, b = 1`  \
  **Explanation:** After rotating the string and adding 3 to odd indices, we get the smallest possible string, which is "3789".

- **Input:** `s = "1567", a = 4, b = 2`  \
  **Explanation:** In this case, the string is already the lexicographically smallest, and no further operations can make it smaller.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
To solve this problem, we apply the operations in various combinations, keeping track of the lexicographically smallest string generated.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The operations can be applied multiple times, and we need to explore all possibilities to find the smallest string.
- We will rotate the string and apply the addition operation to each resulting string, comparing to find the smallest possible string.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- The string is guaranteed to have a length of at least 2, so we do not need to handle empty inputs.
- Ensure the solution works for strings of length up to 100.
- Handle cases where no further operations can produce a smaller string.
- Ensure all operations are applied efficiently, especially when dealing with large strings.

## Code üíª
```cpp
class Solution {

string ans;
int a, b;
int n;
unordered_set<string> seen;

bool isVisited(string s) {
    return seen.find(s) != seen.end();
}

void visit(string s) {
    ans = min(ans, s);
    seen.insert(s);
}    

string rotate(string s, int x) {
    reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
    reverse(s.begin(), s.begin()+x);
    reverse(s.begin()+x, s.end());
    return s;
}

 string add(string s, int x) {
    for (int i=1; i<n; i += 2) {
        char &c = s[i];
        c = '0' + (c-'0'+x)%10;
    }
    return s;
}
public:
string findLexSmallestString(string s, int a, int b) {
    ans = s;
    this->a = a;
    this->b = b;
    n = s.size();
    dfs(s);
    return ans;
}
void dfs(string s){
    if(isVisited(s)) return;
    visit(s);
    dfs(rotate(s, b));
    dfs(add(s, a));
}
```

This code defines the Solution class with methods to manipulate and rotate a string in specific ways, as well as find the lexicographically smallest string by applying transformations based on the values of a and b.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Average Case:** O(n^2)
- **Worst Case:** O(n^2)

The worst case occurs when all rotations and additions must be explored.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

Space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of strings in the recursion stack and visited set.
