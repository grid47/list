You are given an integer array nums. The task is to compute the product of all the elements in the array and return the sign of the product. Implement the function signFunc(x) that returns 1 if x is positive, -1 if x is negative, and 0 if x is 0. Return signFunc(product) for the array.

### Input Representations 📥
- **Input:** The input consists of an array nums containing integers.
- **Example:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
	- -100 <= nums[i] <= 100

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications 📤
- **Output:** Return the result of signFunc(product) where product is the product of all elements in the array.
- **Example:** `Output: 1`
- **Constraints:**
	- The product can be a very large number, but signFunc only needs to determine the sign of the product.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic 🔍
**Goal:** Determine the sign of the product of elements in nums.

- Initialize a variable to store the product sign (positive, negative, or zero).
- Iterate over the array nums and adjust the sign based on the number of negative elements.
- If any element is zero, return the sign for zero immediately.
- Return the final computed sign.

### Problem Assumptions ✅
- The input array is non-empty.
- The product can be large but will not overflow if handled correctly.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples 🧩
- **Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  \
  **Explanation:** The product is positive, so the return value is 1.

## Approach 🚀
The approach is to iterate through the array, multiplying the values and keeping track of whether the product is positive, negative, or zero.

### Initial Thoughts 💭
- We only need the sign of the product, not the actual product itself.
- If there is a zero in the array, the product is zero, and we can return 0 immediately.

### Edge Cases 🌐
- An empty array should not be allowed by the constraints.
- Large arrays should be handled efficiently with a time complexity of O(n).
- If the array contains a zero, the result is immediately zero.
- The solution should work for the full range of allowed input sizes and values.

## Code 💻
```cpp
int arraySign(vector<int>& nums) {
    int sgn = 1;
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if(nums[i] == 0) {
            sgn = 0;
            break;
        } else if(nums[i] > 0) {
            
        } else if(nums[i] < 0) {
            sgn *= -1;
        }
    }
    return sgn;
}
```

The function `arraySign` calculates the sign of the product of elements in the array `nums`. It returns 1 if the product is positive, -1 if the product is negative, and 0 if the product contains a zero.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown 🛠️
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int arraySign(vector<int>& nums) {
	```
	This is the function definition for `arraySign`, which takes a vector `nums` as input and returns an integer indicating the sign of the product of its elements.

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int sgn = 1;
	```
	The variable `sgn` is initialized to 1, representing the sign of the product. It will be updated during iteration through the array.

3. **Loop Setup**
	```cpp
	    for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
	```
	This `for` loop iterates through each element in the `nums` vector to evaluate its effect on the product's sign.

4. **Check for Zero**
	```cpp
	        if(nums[i] == 0) {
	```
	This conditional checks if the current element of the array is zero. If found, the product will be zero, so `sgn` is set to 0.

5. **Set Sign to Zero**
	```cpp
	            sgn = 0;
	```
	If an element is zero, the sign is immediately set to zero, as multiplying by zero results in zero.

6. **Break Loop**
	```cpp
	            break;
	```
	Once a zero is found, the loop is broken, as the sign has already been determined (0).

7. **Check for Positive Number**
	```cpp
	        } else if(nums[i] > 0) {
	```
	This checks if the current element is positive. Positive numbers do not change the sign, so nothing needs to be done.

8. **Check for Negative Number**
	```cpp
	        } else if(nums[i] < 0) {
	```
	This conditional checks if the current element is negative. Negative numbers flip the sign of the product, so `sgn` is updated accordingly.

9. **Flip the Sign**
	```cpp
	            sgn *= -1;
	```
	When a negative number is found, the sign is flipped by multiplying `sgn` by -1.

10. **Return Sign**
	```cpp
	    return sgn;
	```
	The final sign of the product is returned. It can be 1 (positive), -1 (negative), or 0 (if any element was zero).

## Complexity Analysis 📊
### Time Complexity ⏳
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Average Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The solution requires a single pass over the array to compute the result, making it O(n) in time complexity.

### Space Complexity 💾
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

The space complexity is O(1) because we only need to keep track of the sign during the iteration.
