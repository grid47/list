### Problem Statement

The task is to determine the sign of the product of an array of integers. The product can either be positive, negative, or zero. The sign can be represented as:
- 1 if the product is positive,
- -1 if the product is negative,
- 0 if the product is zero.

The input is an array of integers, and the goal is to compute the sign of their product without explicitly calculating the product itself.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a straightforward approach:
1. **Iterate Through the Array**: We will iterate through each element of the given array.
2. **Check for Zero**: If we encounter a zero in the array, we immediately know that the product will be zero, and we can return 0.
3. **Count Negative Numbers**: We maintain a sign variable that keeps track of the overall sign. We will increment this variable by multiplying it by -1 every time we encounter a negative number.
4. **Determine Final Sign**: At the end of the iteration, if we do not encounter any zeros, the sign will indicate whether the product is positive or negative.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here's the implementation of the approach:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int arraySign(vector<int>& nums) {
```
- The `Solution` class is defined, and within it, the `arraySign` method is declared, which takes a vector of integers as input.

```cpp
        int sgn = 1;
```
- We initialize a variable `sgn` to 1. This variable will keep track of the sign of the product.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
```
- We begin a loop that will iterate over each element in the `nums` array.

```cpp
            if(nums[i] == 0) {
                sgn = 0;
                break;
            }
```
- Within the loop, we first check if the current number is zero. If it is, we set `sgn` to 0 and break out of the loop since the product is guaranteed to be zero.

```cpp
            else if(nums[i] > 0) {
                // Positive number, do nothing
            } 
```
- If the number is positive, we do nothing and simply continue the loop since positive numbers do not affect the overall sign of the product.

```cpp
            else if(nums[i] < 0) {
                sgn *= -1;
            }
        }
```
- If the number is negative, we multiply `sgn` by -1 to toggle the sign. This accounts for the fact that multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number, while multiplying a negative number with a positive number results in a negative number.

```cpp
        return sgn;
    }
};
```
- Finally, after processing all elements in the array, we return the value of `sgn`, which now reflects the sign of the product.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we need to iterate through the entire array to determine the sign of the product.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are using a fixed amount of space for the `sgn` variable, regardless of the size of the input array.

### Conclusion

The `arraySign` function provides a simple and efficient way to determine the sign of the product of an integer array. By leveraging the properties of multiplication and iterating through the array, we can achieve the desired result without the need to compute the actual product.

This approach is beneficial, especially when dealing with large arrays, as it avoids potential overflow issues that may arise from multiplying large integers. Additionally, by checking for zeros early in the process, we can terminate the computation promptly, which enhances the efficiency of the solution.

In summary, this implementation demonstrates the importance of understanding mathematical properties in programming. By carefully considering the implications of multiplying positive and negative integers, we can devise efficient solutions to seemingly complex problems. The `arraySign` function exemplifies how to achieve clarity and conciseness in code, ensuring that our solutions are not only effective but also maintainable and easy to understand.
