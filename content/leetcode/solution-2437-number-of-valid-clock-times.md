You are given a string `time` representing the current time on a 24-hour digital clock in the format 'hh:mm', where some digits are replaced with the '?' symbol. The '?' character can be replaced with any digit from 0 to 9. Your task is to return the total number of valid clock times that can be formed by replacing all '?' characters in the string.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input string `time` is a valid time string of length 5 in the format 'hh:mm', with some digits replaced by the '?' character.
- **Example:** `time = "?3:15"`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= length of `time` <= 5
	- The string is a valid 24-hour time format, i.e., 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59.
	- Any '?' in the string can be replaced with a digit from 0 to 9.

### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return an integer representing the number of valid times that can be formed by replacing '?' with digits from 0 to 9.
- **Example:** `Output: 9`
- **Constraints:**
	- The output is the total number of valid time combinations.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** We need to count all valid times that can be formed by replacing '?' with digits while respecting the constraints of the 24-hour clock format.

- 1. Iterate through each character in the `time` string.
- 2. If the character is a '?', calculate how many valid digits can replace it based on its position in the time format (hours or minutes).
- 3. Multiply the possibilities for each '?' to get the total number of valid times.
- 4. Return the final count of valid combinations.

### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The input string `time` follows the 24-hour format, where hours range from '00' to '23' and minutes range from '00' to '59'.
- The input string is guaranteed to be a valid time representation with '?' representing unknown digits.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `time = "?5:00"`  \
  **Explanation:** For the time `?5:00`, the first '?' can be replaced with either '0' or '1', but not '2' because the hour cannot be '25'. This gives two valid times: '05:00' and '15:00'.

- **Input:** `time = "0?:0?"`  \
  **Explanation:** In the time `0?:0?`, the first '?' can be replaced with any digit from 0 to 9, but the second '?' can also be any digit. This results in 100 possible valid times.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
We need to calculate the number of valid time representations that can be formed by replacing '?' in the string with digits from 0 to 9, ensuring the resulting time remains valid under the 24-hour format.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The number of valid time possibilities depends on the positions of the '?' characters in the hours and minutes part of the time.
- We need to carefully handle the replacement of '?' depending on whether it's in the hour or minute part of the time string.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- The input will always be a valid time string, so no empty inputs need to be considered.
- This problem does not involve large inputs outside of the fixed string size.
- If '?' appears at the first digit of the hour, it must be replaced by a valid number based on the second digit's value.
- Ensure that the number of possibilities is always calculated in a way that respects the limits of a 24-hour time format.

## Code üíª
```cpp
int countTime(string time) {
    int ans = 1;
    if(time[4] == '?') ans = ans * 10;
    if(time[3] == '?') ans = ans * 6;
    
    if(time[0] == '?' && time[1] == '?') ans = ans * 24;
    else{
        if(time[1] == '?'){ 
            if(time[0] == '2' ) ans = ans * 4;
            else ans = ans * 10;
        }
        if(time[0] == '?'){
            if(time[1] < '4') ans = ans * 3;
            else ans = ans * 2;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```

The complete function `countTime` calculates the number of valid times based on a given input string with placeholders ('?').

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int countTime(string time) {
	```
	This line defines the function `countTime` which takes a string `time` as input and returns an integer representing the number of valid times.

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int ans = 1;
	```
	The variable `ans` is initialized to 1. It will store the result of the calculations based on the input time string.

3. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	    if(time[4] == '?') ans = ans * 10;
	```
	If the 5th character in the time string (index 4) is a '?' symbol, it can represent any digit between 0 and 9, so we multiply the answer by 10.

4. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	    if(time[3] == '?') ans = ans * 6;
	```
	If the 4th character in the time string (index 3) is a '?' symbol, it can represent any digit between 0 and 5 (to form a valid minute), so we multiply the answer by 6.

5. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	    if(time[0] == '?' && time[1] == '?') ans = ans * 24;
	```
	If both the 1st and 2nd characters of the time string are '?', the hour can range from 00 to 23, so we multiply the answer by 24.

6. **Else Condition**
	```cpp
	    else{
	```
	If the first two characters are not both '?', the function checks individual components of the hour.

7. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	        if(time[1] == '?'){ 
	```
	If only the second character in the hour (minute's tens place) is '?', the function checks the first character.

8. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	            if(time[0] == '2' ) ans = ans * 4;
	```
	If the first character of the hour is '2', the second character can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3, so we multiply the answer by 4.

9. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	            else ans = ans * 10;
	```
	If the first character of the hour is not '2', the second character can range from 0 to 9, so we multiply the answer by 10.

10. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	        if(time[0] == '?'){
	```
	If the first character in the hour (hour's tens place) is '?', we check the value of the second character.

11. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	            if(time[1] < '4') ans = ans * 3;
	```
	If the second character is less than '4', the first character can be 0, 1, or 2, so we multiply the answer by 3.

12. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	            else ans = ans * 2;
	```
	If the second character is 4 or greater, the first character can only be 0 or 1, so we multiply the answer by 2.

13. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return ans;
	```
	The function returns the final computed value of `ans`, representing the total number of valid times that can be formed.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Average Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

The time complexity is O(1) as the string length is constant (5 characters), and the solution requires only a few conditional checks.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

The space complexity is O(1) since no extra space is required, apart from a few integer variables.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
