Given a string s consisting of digits, check if it is possible to split it into two or more non-empty substrings such that the numerical values of the substrings are in strictly descending order and the difference between the values of adjacent substrings is exactly 1.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input consists of a string s made up of digits.
- **Example:** `"5432"`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= s.length <= 20
	- s consists only of digits

### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return true if it is possible to split the string into substrings satisfying the conditions; otherwise, return false.
- **Example:** `true`
- **Constraints:**

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** To find a valid way to split the string into substrings that meet the conditions.

- Start by iterating through the string and attempting to split it into substrings.
- For each split, check if the substrings' numerical values are in strictly descending order with a difference of exactly 1 between adjacent values.
- Return true if a valid split is found, otherwise return false.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The input string will always contain at least one character.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `"1000001"`  \
  **Explanation:** The string can be split into the substrings ['1', '00000', '1'], which correspond to the values [1, 0, 1]. These values are in descending order with a difference of 1, so the split is valid.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
We will attempt to split the string in different ways and check if any of those splits satisfy the conditions of strictly descending values and adjacent differences of exactly 1.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- We need to check all possible ways of splitting the string and validate if the split satisfies the numerical conditions.
- We can approach this problem using a recursive backtracking method, where we try different splits and check if they meet the criteria.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- The input string will never be empty, as the length is guaranteed to be at least 1.
- The string length will not exceed 20, so efficiency for large inputs is not a concern.
- Consider cases where the string consists of repeating digits or where it starts with zeros.
- The solution should handle strings with lengths from 1 to 20 efficiently.

## Code üíª
```cpp
string s;
bool splitString(string s) {
    this->s = s;
    double tmp = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < s.size() - 1; i++) {
        tmp = tmp * 10 + (s[i] - '0');
        if(bt(i + 1, tmp)) return true;
    }
    return false;
}

bool bt(int idx, double prv) {

    if(idx == s.size()) return true;
    
    double tmp = 0;
    for(int i = idx; i < s.size(); i++) {
        tmp = tmp * 10 + (s[i] - '0');
        if(tmp - prv > -1) break;
        if(tmp - prv == -1) {
            if(bt(i + 1, tmp))
                return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

This code defines a function `splitString` that checks if a given string `s` can be split into a sequence of numbers where each consecutive number differs by exactly 1. It uses a backtracking helper function `bt` to explore possible splits and returns true if such a split exists.

{{< dots >}}
### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Variable Declaration**
	```cpp
	string s;
	```
	Declares a string variable `s` which will hold the input string to be split.

2. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	bool splitString(string s) {
	```
	Defines the `splitString` function, which takes a string `s` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether it can be split into a sequence of numbers with a difference of 1 between consecutive numbers.

3. **Assignment**
	```cpp
	    this->s = s;
	```
	Assigns the input string `s` to the member variable `this->s`.

4. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    double tmp = 0;
	```
	Initializes a temporary variable `tmp` of type double to store the value of the current number being formed during the iteration.

5. **Loop Initialization**
	```cpp
	    for(int i = 0; i < s.size() - 1; i++) {
	```
	Starts a loop that iterates through the string `s`, except for the last character. The loop is used to form numbers from the string.

6. **String to Number Conversion**
	```cpp
	        tmp = tmp * 10 + (s[i] - '0');
	```
	Forms a number by converting the current character `s[i]` to its integer value and updating `tmp`.

7. **Backtracking Function Call**
	```cpp
	        if(bt(i + 1, tmp)) return true;
	```
	Calls the backtracking function `bt` with the next index `i + 1` and the current value of `tmp` to check if the string can be split starting from that index.

8. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return false;
	```
	If no valid split is found, the function returns false, indicating that the string cannot be split into the desired sequence.

9. **Backtracking Function Definition**
	```cpp
	bool bt(int idx, double prv) {
	```
	Defines the helper function `bt` (backtracking), which attempts to find a valid split starting at index `idx` and with the previous number `prv`.

10. **Base Case**
	```cpp
	    if(idx == s.size()) return true;
	```
	Checks if the current index has reached the end of the string. If so, it returns true, indicating a successful split.

11. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    double tmp = 0;
	```
	Initializes a temporary variable `tmp` to store the current number formed from the string.

12. **Loop Initialization**
	```cpp
	    for(int i = idx; i < s.size(); i++) {
	```
	Starts a loop that iterates from the current index `idx` to the end of the string `s`. It attempts to form the next possible number.

13. **String to Number Conversion**
	```cpp
	        tmp = tmp * 10 + (s[i] - '0');
	```
	Forms a number by converting the current character `s[i]` to its integer value and updating `tmp`.

14. **Backtracking Pruning**
	```cpp
	        if(tmp - prv > -1) break;
	```
	Prunes the search space. If the difference between the current number `tmp` and the previous number `prv` is greater than -1, it breaks the loop because the sequence cannot continue.

15. **Backtracking Condition**
	```cpp
	        if(tmp - prv == -1) {
	```
	Checks if the difference between the current number `tmp` and the previous number `prv` is exactly -1, which is the condition for a valid split.

16. **Recursive Call**
	```cpp
	            if(bt(i + 1, tmp))
	```
	Makes a recursive call to `bt` with the next index `i + 1` and the current value of `tmp` to check if the rest of the string can be split.

17. **Return True**
	```cpp
	                return true;
	```
	If the recursive call returns true, indicating a valid split, the function returns true.

18. **Return False**
	```cpp
	    return false;
	```
	If no valid split is found, the function returns false.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n^2)
- **Average Case:** O(n^2)
- **Worst Case:** O(n^2)

The time complexity is quadratic in terms of the length of the string because we check all possible splits and validate each one.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the intermediate substrings during the split process.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
