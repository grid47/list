You are given an n x n binary matrix where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. There are exactly two islands in the grid, and you need to connect them by flipping the smallest number of 0's to 1's. An island is a group of 1's that are connected horizontally or vertically. Your task is to find the minimum number of flips required to connect the two islands.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input consists of an n x n binary matrix, where each cell is either 0 or 1.
- **Example:** `Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]`
- **Constraints:**
	- 2 <= n <= 100
	- grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1
	- There are exactly two islands in the grid

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the smallest number of 0's that must be flipped to connect the two islands.
- **Example:** `Output: 1`
- **Constraints:**
	- The grid will always contain exactly two islands.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** To connect the two islands with the minimum number of flips, we first identify one island using depth-first search (DFS), then perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path to the other island by flipping the minimum number of 0's to 1's.

- 1. Use DFS to find the first island and store its coordinates.
- 2. Use BFS from the first island to find the shortest path to the second island, counting the number of 0's encountered along the way.
- 3. Return the number of flips required to connect the two islands.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The grid will always contain exactly two islands, so no edge cases with more or fewer islands are possible.
- The grid will not be empty and will always have a size of at least 2x2.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]`  \
  **Explanation:** In this example, there are two islands represented by 1's at positions (0,1) and (1,0). The minimum number of flips required to connect them is 1, flipping the 0 at position (0,0).

- **Input:** `Input: grid = [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]`  \
  **Explanation:** In this example, the two islands are at positions (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), and (2,2). The minimum number of flips required to connect them is 2, flipping the two 0's at positions (1,0) and (1,2).

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
We solve this problem using depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). First, we perform DFS to find and mark all the cells of one island, then use BFS to find the shortest path to the second island, flipping the minimum number of 0's along the way.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- We can use DFS to mark all the cells of one island, then use BFS to find the shortest path to the second island, ensuring we flip the fewest number of 0's.
- This approach effectively reduces the problem to a shortest path search, ensuring an optimal solution.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- There will always be exactly two islands, so no empty inputs are possible.
- The solution should efficiently handle the largest grid sizes (up to 100x100).
- The grid may contain only land (1's) or only water (0's), but there will always be two islands to connect.
- The input grid will always contain exactly two islands, and no more.

## Code üíª
```cpp
int shortestBridge(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;
    bool flag = false;
    int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
    for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j]) {
                dfs(i, j, q, grid);
                flag = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (flag) break;
    }
    
    int step = 0;
    int dir[5] = {0,1,0,-1,0};
    while(!q.empty()) {
        int sz = q.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < sz; i++) {
            pair<int, int> p = q.front();
            q.pop();
            for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                int x = p.first + dir[i], y = p.second + dir[i+1];
                if(x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= grid.size() || y >= grid[0].size() || grid[x][y] == -1)
                    continue;
                if(grid[x][y] == 1) return step;
                q.push({x, y});
                grid[x][y] = -1;
            }
        }
        step++;
    }
    return -1;
}

void dfs(int x, int y, queue<pair<int, int>> &q, vector<vector<int>> &grid) {
    if(x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= grid.size() || y >= grid[0].size() || grid[x][y] != 1)
        return;
    q.push(make_pair(x, y));
    grid[x][y] = -1;
    dfs(x + 1, y, q, grid);
    dfs(x - 1, y, q, grid);
    dfs(x, y + 1, q, grid);
    dfs(x, y - 1, q, grid);
}
```

This code solves the problem of finding the shortest bridge between two islands in a grid using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm after identifying one island with depth-first search (DFS).

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Initialization**
	```cpp
	int shortestBridge(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
	```

	Call the DFS function to explore the first island and fill the queue with its land cells.

9. **Set Flag**
	```cpp

18. **Queue Pop**
	```cpp
	            q.pop();
	```
	Remove the element from the queue.

19. **Direction Loop**
	```cpp
	            for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n^2)
- **Average Case:** O(n^2)
- **Worst Case:** O(n^2)

Both DFS and BFS operate in O(n^2) time, where n is the number of rows (or columns) in the grid.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(n^2)
- **Worst Case:** O(n^2)

The space complexity is O(n^2) due to the need to store the grid and the visited cells during the DFS and BFS.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
