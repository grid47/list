Alice and Bob are tasked with watering a garden of n plants. The plants are arranged in a row and need varying amounts of water. Alice waters the plants from left to right, while Bob waters them from right to left. They both begin with full watering cans. If they don‚Äôt have enough water for the next plant, they refill their cans. In case they both reach the same plant, the one with more water in their can should water the plant, or Alice waters it in case of a tie. The goal is to determine how many times Alice and Bob have to refill their cans to water all the plants.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** You are given a 0-indexed integer array, plants, where each element represents the amount of water a corresponding plant needs. Additionally, two integers, capacityA and capacityB, represent the capacities of Alice‚Äôs and Bob‚Äôs watering cans, respectively.
- **Example:** `plants = [3, 2, 5, 4], capacityA = 6, capacityB = 6`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= plants.length <= 10^5
	- 1 <= plants[i] <= 10^6
	- max(plants[i]) <= capacityA, capacityB <= 10^9

### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the number of times Alice and Bob need to refill their watering cans in order to water all the plants.
- **Example:** `For plants = [3, 2, 5, 4], capacityA = 6, capacityB = 6, the output is 2.`
- **Constraints:**

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** The goal is to efficiently compute the number of refills required by simulating the watering process while tracking the remaining water in Alice's and Bob's cans.

- Initialize two pointers, one for Alice starting from the left (i = 0) and one for Bob starting from the right (j = n - 1).
- Initialize counters for Alice's and Bob's current water levels (alice, bob) with the respective capacities.
- Simulate the process of watering plants for both Alice and Bob, adjusting the number of refills as needed.
- If either Alice or Bob runs out of water for their current plant, they refill their can and continue watering.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- Alice and Bob always start with full watering cans.
- Alice waters the plants from left to right, and Bob waters the plants from right to left.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `Example 1: plants = [3, 2, 5, 4], capacityA = 6, capacityB = 6`  \
  **Explanation:** Initially, both Alice and Bob have 6 units of water. Alice waters plant 0 (3 units), leaving 3 units in her can. Bob waters plant 3 (4 units), leaving 2 units in his can. Alice then waters plant 1 (2 units), leaving 1 unit in her can, and Bob refills and waters plant 2 (5 units), leaving 1 unit in his can. Total refills = 2.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the watering process for both Alice and Bob. We keep track of their current water levels and count how many times they need to refill during the process.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- We need to simulate a simultaneous watering process for both Alice and Bob, which means tracking their water usage at the same time.
- Refills are required when either Alice or Bob doesn't have enough water to water the next plant.
- Efficiently handling the watering process and counting refills is key to solving this problem in optimal time.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- If there are no plants (empty list), no watering is needed and thus no refills.
- For very large input sizes, ensuring the algorithm is efficient enough to handle up to 10^5 plants is crucial.
- If all plants require less water than the capacities of Alice and Bob, no refills are needed.
- The solution should operate within O(n) time complexity to handle the upper constraint of 10^5 plants.

## Code üíª
```cpp
int minimumRefill(vector<int>& plant, int capA, int capB) {
    int n = plant.size();
    int i = 0, j = n - 1;
    int cnt = 0;
    
    int alice = capA, bob = capB;
    
    while(i <= j) {
        if(i < j) {
            if(alice >= plant[i]) {
                alice -= plant[i];
            } else {
                cnt++;
                alice = capA;
                alice -= plant[i];
            }
            i++;
            
            if(bob >= plant[j]) {
                bob -= plant[j];
            } else {
                cnt++;
                bob = capB;
                bob -= plant[j];
            }
            j--;
        } else {
            if(alice >= bob) {
                if(alice >= plant[i]) {
                    alice -= plant[i];
                } else {
                    cnt++;
                    alice = capA;
                    alice -= plant[i];                        
                }
            } else {
                if(bob >= plant[i]) {
                    bob -= plant[i];
                } else {
                    cnt++;
                    bob = capB;
                    bob -= plant[i];                        
                }                    
            }
            i++, j--;
        }
    }
    return cnt;
}
```

This code implements a solution to the problem where Alice and Bob are refilling plants, and the goal is to determine the minimum number of refills they need based on their tank capacities and the water needs of each plant. The code uses a two-pointer technique, where one pointer starts at the beginning and the other at the end of the plant list.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Average Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The time complexity is linear because we only iterate through the list of plants once.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

The space complexity is constant as we only need a few variables to track the water levels and the current plant positions.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
