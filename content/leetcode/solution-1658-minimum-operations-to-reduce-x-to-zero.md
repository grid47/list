You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `x`. In each operation, you can either remove the leftmost or rightmost element from the array and subtract its value from `x`. The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce `x` to exactly 0, or return -1 if it's not possible.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** You are given two inputs: an integer array `nums` and an integer `x`.
- **Example:** `nums = [2, 3, 1, 4, 1], x = 5`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
	- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
	- 1 <= x <= 10^9

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the minimum number of operations needed to reduce `x` to 0, or -1 if it's not possible.
- **Example:** `2`
- **Constraints:**
	- The output will be a single integer: either the minimum number of operations or -1.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** Determine the minimum number of operations to reduce `x` to 0, by removing elements from either end of the array and subtracting their value from `x`.

- Calculate the total sum of elements in `nums`. If the sum is smaller than `x`, return -1 immediately.
- Use a sliding window approach to check the sum of subarrays of `nums` that can contribute to reducing `x` to 0.
- Keep track of the longest subarray that matches the condition of reducing `x` to 0, and calculate the number of operations.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The array `nums` contains only positive integers.
- The array has a length between 1 and 100,000, and `x` can be as large as 1 billion.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `nums = [2, 3, 1, 4, 1], x = 5`  \
  **Explanation:** In this case, we can remove the last two elements (4 + 1 = 5) to reduce `x` to 0, requiring exactly 2 operations.

- **Input:** `nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], x = 3`  \
  **Explanation:** In this case, it‚Äôs impossible to remove elements from the array to sum to `x = 3`. Hence, the answer is -1.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
We will use a sliding window approach to find the longest subarray that can reduce `x` to 0 by removing elements from the array.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The problem can be reduced to finding a subarray whose sum is equal to `sum(nums) - x`.
- Using a sliding window or prefix sum technique will help optimize the solution for large inputs.
- Start by checking if the sum of all elements in `nums` is smaller than `x`. If it is, return -1 immediately.
- Otherwise, calculate the difference between the sum of the array and `x`.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- If `nums` is empty, return -1 immediately.
- For large arrays, ensure that the algorithm handles the input within acceptable time limits.
- If `x` is greater than the sum of all elements in `nums`, return -1.
- Ensure that the solution works efficiently with up to 100,000 elements.

## Code üíª
```cpp
int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int x) {
    int res = -1;
    long sum = -x;
    for(int y: nums) sum += y;
    int n = nums.size();
    if (sum == 0) return n;
    
    map<int, int> mp;
    mp[0] = -1;
    int s = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        s += nums[i];
        if(mp.count(s - sum)) {
            res = max(res, i - mp[s - sum]);
        }
        mp[s] = i;
    }
    
    return res == -1? res :n - res;        
}
```

This function computes the minimum number of operations to reduce the sum of a given array to a target value `x` by removing elements from either end. It uses a prefix sum approach with a map for optimization.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int x) {
	```
	Defines the function `minOperations` which takes an array and a target value as inputs.

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int res = -1;
	```
	Initializes the result variable `res` to -1 to track the maximum subarray length.

3. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    long sum = -x;
	```
	Initializes `sum` to -x to adjust the target for finding a subarray with a specific sum.

4. **Looping**
	```cpp
	    for(int y: nums) sum += y;
	```
	Calculates the total sum of the array and adjusts `sum` for further processing.

5. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int n = nums.size();
	```
	Stores the size of the array in `n` for use in subsequent logic.

6. **Condition Check**
	```cpp
	    if (sum == 0) return n;
	```
	Checks if the total sum equals `x`. If true, the entire array is the solution.

7. **Map Initialization**
	```cpp
	    map<int, int> mp;
	```
	Initializes a map to store prefix sums and their corresponding indices.

8. **Map Update**
	```cpp
	    mp[0] = -1;
	```
	Adds an initial entry to the map for handling prefix sums starting from the beginning.

9. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int s = 0;
	```
	Initializes the prefix sum variable `s` to zero.

10. **Looping**
	```cpp
	    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	```
	Iterates through the array to compute prefix sums and check for subarray matches.

11. **Sum Update**
	```cpp
	        s += nums[i];
	```
	Updates the prefix sum `s` with the current element.

12. **Condition Check**
	```cpp
	        if(mp.count(s - sum)) {
	```
	Checks if there exists a prefix sum in the map such that the difference equals the target sum.

13. **Update Result**
	```cpp
	            res = max(res, i - mp[s - sum]);
	```
	Updates `res` to the maximum length of a valid subarray found so far.

14. **Map Update**
	```cpp
	        mp[s] = i;
	```
	Adds the current prefix sum and its index to the map for future reference.

15. **Return**
	```cpp
	    return res == -1? res :n - res;        
	```
	Returns the minimum operations needed by converting the subarray length to elements removed.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Average Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The time complexity is linear because we scan the array once using the sliding window technique.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of intermediate results like prefix sums or hash maps.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
