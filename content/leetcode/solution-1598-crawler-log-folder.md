You are working with a file system that logs folder change operations. The file system starts in the main folder, and the operations allow the user to move to a parent folder, remain in the current folder, or navigate to a child folder. Given a list of operations, your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to return to the main folder after performing all the operations.

### Input Representations 📥
- **Input:** You are given a list of strings where each string represents a folder operation. Operations include moving to a parent folder ('../'), staying in the current folder ('./'), or moving to a child folder ('x/').
- **Example:** `Input: logs = ['folder1/', 'folder2/', '../', 'folder21/', './']`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= logs.length <= 1000
	- 2 <= logs[i].length <= 10
	- logs[i] contains lowercase English letters, digits, '.', and '/'
	- logs[i] follows the described format

### Output Specifications 📤
- **Output:** Return the minimum number of operations required to return to the main folder after the changes are applied.
- **Example:** `Output: 2`
- **Constraints:**
	- The returned number is a non-negative integer.

### Core Logic 🔍
**Goal:** The goal is to find the minimum number of operations to go back to the main folder.

- 1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the current folder level, starting at 0 (main folder).
- 2. For each operation, adjust the counter based on the operation type ('../' decreases level, 'x/' increases level, './' leaves the level unchanged).
- 3. After processing all operations, the counter will indicate the number of operations needed to return to the main folder.

### Problem Assumptions ✅
- The folder operations are guaranteed to follow the specified format.

## Examples 🧩
- **Input:** `Input: logs = ['folder1/', 'folder2/', '../', 'folder21/', './']`  \
  **Explanation:** In this case, we move to 'folder1', then to 'folder2', go back to the main folder using '../', move to 'folder21', and stay in the current folder. To return to the main folder, we need to move back twice using '../', hence the output is 2.

- **Input:** `Input: logs = ['folder1/', 'folder2/', './', 'folder3/', '../', 'folder31/']`  \
  **Explanation:** After moving through various folders, we must return 3 levels up to get back to the main folder. Thus, the output is 3.

- **Input:** `Input: logs = ['folder1/', '../', '../', '../']`  \
  **Explanation:** In this case, after moving to 'folder1', we use '../' three times to get back to the main folder, and since we're already in the main folder, the output is 0.

## Approach 🚀
The approach involves simulating the folder change operations, adjusting the folder level accordingly. We use a simple counter to track the number of steps required to return to the main folder.

### Initial Thoughts 💭
- Each operation can either increase, decrease, or leave the folder level unchanged.
- We don't need to simulate every individual operation, but rather just track the folder depth.
- By keeping track of the folder level, we can directly compute the minimum number of operations to return to the main folder.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases 🌐
- If no operations are provided, return 0.
- The problem can handle up to 1000 operations, so the solution should efficiently handle large input sizes.
- Consider cases where all operations are './', which would mean no movement and thus 0 operations to return.
- Ensure the solution works within the constraints, especially the maximum size of the input list.

## Code 💻
```cpp
static int minOperations(vector<string>& logs) {
    int level=0;
    for(auto& dir: logs){
        if (dir=="../") 
            level-=(level>0);
        else if (dir!="./")
            level++;
    //    cout<<level<<endl;
    }
    return level;
}
```

This function calculates the minimum number of operations required to navigate through a list of directory logs, which can be of three types: going up a directory ('../'), staying in the current directory ('./'), or entering a new directory. The function keeps track of the 'level' in the directory structure, returning the final level after processing all operations.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown 🛠️
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	static int minOperations(vector<string>& logs) {
	```
	This is the function signature. It defines a static function 'minOperations' that takes a reference to a vector of strings, 'logs', representing the directory operations.

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int level=0;
	```
	Here, a variable 'level' is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to track the current level in the directory structure.

3. **Loop**
	```cpp
	    for(auto& dir: logs){
	```
	This 'for' loop iterates over each directory operation in the 'logs' vector.

4. **Condition Check**
	```cpp
	        if (dir=="../") 
	```
	This condition checks if the current operation is moving up one directory ('../').

5. **Level Adjustment**
	```cpp
	            level-=(level>0);
	```
	If the 'dir' is '../', the level is decremented by 1, but only if the current level is greater than 0, ensuring that it doesn't go below 0.

6. **Condition Check**
	```cpp
	        else if (dir!="./")
	```
	This condition checks if the directory operation is not './', i.e., the operation is a valid directory movement (entering a new directory).

7. **Level Adjustment**
	```cpp
	            level++;
	```
	If the directory operation is not './' (i.e., a new directory is entered), the level is incremented by 1.

8. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return level;
	```
	After all operations have been processed, the final 'level' is returned, indicating the final position in the directory structure.

## Complexity Analysis 📊
### Time Complexity ⏳
- **Best Case:** O(n) - If all operations are './', no level changes are needed.
- **Average Case:** O(n) - We always iterate over the input list once.
- **Worst Case:** O(n) - In the worst case, we may need to process all operations.

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the logs list.

### Space Complexity 💾
- **Best Case:** O(1) - The space complexity remains constant regardless of the input size.
- **Worst Case:** O(1) - We only need a few variables to track the current folder level.

The space complexity is O(1), as we are only using a fixed amount of memory to store the folder level.
