You are given an array nums containing positive integers and an integer k. In each operation, you can remove the last element from the array and add it to your collection. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to collect all elements from 1 to k (inclusive).

### Input Representations 📥
- **Input:** The input consists of an array of positive integers nums and an integer k. The goal is to collect elements from 1 to k in the minimum number of operations.
- **Example:** `nums = [6, 3, 8, 5, 7, 1, 4, 2], k = 3`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= nums.length <= 50
	- 1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length
	- 1 <= k <= nums.length

### Output Specifications 📤
- **Output:** Return the minimum number of operations needed to collect all elements from 1 to k in the collection.
- **Example:** `For input nums = [6, 3, 8, 5, 7, 1, 4, 2], k = 3, the output is 6.`
- **Constraints:**

### Core Logic 🔍
**Goal:** The goal is to collect all numbers from 1 to k in the least number of operations.

- Start removing elements from the end of the array one by one.
- Keep track of the elements you collect in your collection.
- Stop when all elements from 1 to k are collected.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ✅
- The input array nums contains all the elements from 1 to k at least once.

## Examples 🧩
- **Input:** `For input nums = [6, 3, 8, 5, 7, 1, 4, 2], k = 3, the output is 6.`  \
  **Explanation:** After 6 operations, elements 1, 2, and 3 will be collected. Thus, the total number of operations is 6.

## Approach 🚀
We will process the array from the last element towards the first, collecting elements until we have all the elements from 1 to k in our collection.

### Initial Thoughts 💭
- The challenge is to determine how many operations it takes to collect the elements from 1 to k, starting from the end of the array.
- One efficient way to approach this is by using a set or array to keep track of the elements that have been collected.

### Edge Cases 🌐
- The input array will always contain at least one element.
- The solution must efficiently handle arrays of size up to 50 elements.
- If all elements are in order or all elements from 1 to k are already in the array, fewer operations will be needed.
- The solution must respect the constraints on the number of elements and the values of k.

## Code 💻
```cpp
int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int cnt[51] = {}, i = nums.size() - 1;
    for (int found = 0; found < k; --i)
        if (nums[i] <= k)
            found += cnt[nums[i]]++ == 0;
    return nums.size() - i - 1;
}
```

This function calculates the minimum number of operations required to perform an action on the given array, using a frequency count to track the required numbers.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown 🛠️
1. **Code Declaration**
	```cpp
	int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
	```
	Function declaration that takes a vector of integers and an integer k as input, returning an integer result.

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int cnt[51] = {}, i = nums.size() - 1;
	```
	Initialize an array to count occurrences of numbers up to 50 and set the index variable i to the last element of nums.

3. **Loop Setup**
	```cpp
	    for (int found = 0; found < k; --i)
	```
	Start a for loop that iterates backwards through the array, with a stopping condition based on found elements.

4. **Condition Check**
	```cpp
	        if (nums[i] <= k)
	```
	Condition that checks if the current element is less than or equal to k.

5. **Frequency Count**
	```cpp
	            found += cnt[nums[i]]++ == 0;
	```
	Increment the 'found' variable if the current number has not been seen before, while updating its count in the cnt array.

6. **Result Calculation**
	```cpp
	    return nums.size() - i - 1;
	```
	Return the difference between the size of the nums vector and the current index, minus one, which represents the result of the operation.

## Complexity Analysis 📊
### Time Complexity ⏳
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Average Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The time complexity is O(n) because we only need to iterate through the array once.

### Space Complexity 💾
- **Best Case:** O(k)
- **Worst Case:** O(k)

The space complexity is O(k) for storing the collected elements in the set.

**Happy Coding! 🎉**
