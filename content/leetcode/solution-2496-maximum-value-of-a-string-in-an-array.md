Given an array of alphanumeric strings, you are tasked with determining the maximum value of any string in the array. The value of a string is determined in the following way: If the string consists only of digits, its value is its numeric representation in base 10. If it contains any letters, its value is the length of the string.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input consists of a list of alphanumeric strings, where each string is composed of digits and lowercase English letters.
- **Example:** `Input: strs = ["hello1", "abc", "9", "010"]`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= strs.length <= 100
	- 1 <= strs[i].length <= 9
	- strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters and digits.

### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the maximum value of any string in the array, based on the aforementioned rules.
- **Example:** `Output: 9`
- **Constraints:**
	- The maximum value is calculated by evaluating the numeric value for strings with only digits, and the length for strings containing letters.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** The goal is to determine the maximum value by checking if each string consists of digits or contains letters, and then applying the respective rule for value calculation.

- 1. Iterate through the list of strings.
- 2. For each string, check if it consists only of digits or contains letters.
- 3. If the string consists of digits, convert it to an integer and compare it with the maximum value found so far.
- 4. If the string contains letters, compare its length with the maximum value.
- 5. Return the maximum value after processing all strings.

### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The input is guaranteed to be valid and conforms to the given constraints.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `Input: strs = ["hello1", "abc", "9", "010"]`  \
  **Explanation:** In this case, the string "hello1" has a length of 6, "abc" has a length of 3, "9" has a value of 9, and "010" has a value of 10. The maximum value is 10.

- **Input:** `Input: strs = ["1", "2", "01", "3"]`  \
  **Explanation:** Each string contains only digits, so the values are 1, 2, 1, and 3, respectively. The maximum value is 3.

## Approach üöÄ
To solve this problem, we need to evaluate each string based on whether it consists only of digits or contains letters. We can then calculate its value and track the maximum value.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The challenge lies in correctly differentiating between strings containing digits and those containing letters.
- We can leverage built-in functions like all_of to check for digit-only strings and handle the string length calculation for others.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- There are no edge cases for empty input since the constraints guarantee at least one string in the array.
- Ensure the solution handles up to 100 strings, each with a maximum length of 9 characters.
- Be cautious of strings with leading zeros, which should still be evaluated correctly as numeric values.
- The function should efficiently handle the constraints and provide the correct result.

## Code üíª
```cpp
public:
int maximumValue(vector<string>& strs) 
{
    int m = 0;
    for (string s : strs)
        if (all_of(s.begin(), s.end(), ::isdigit))
            m = max(m, stoi(s));
        else
            m = max(m, (int)s.size());
    return m;
}
```

The code defines a function `maximumValue` that computes the maximum value from a list of strings. It checks if each string contains only digits or if it represents a number and compares their sizes accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	public:
	```
	Marks the beginning of the function definition in C++ syntax, where the function is defined as a public member function.

2. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int maximumValue(vector<string>& strs) 
	```
	Defines the function `maximumValue`, which takes a vector of strings as an argument and returns an integer, which will be the maximum value determined by the function logic.

3. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int m = 0;
	```
	Initializes a variable `m` to 0, which will hold the maximum value found during the iteration over the input strings.

4. **Looping**
	```cpp
	    for (string s : strs)
	```
	Starts a loop that iterates through each string `s` in the vector `strs`.

5. **Condition Checking**
	```cpp
	        if (all_of(s.begin(), s.end(), ::isdigit))
	```
	Checks if every character in the string `s` is a digit. The `all_of` function verifies this condition.

6. **Mathematical Operations**
	```cpp
	            m = max(m, stoi(s));
	```
	If the string `s` consists only of digits, the value is converted to an integer using `stoi()` and compared with `m`. The maximum value is assigned to `m`.

7. **Else Condition**
	```cpp
	        else
	```
	Executes the following block of code if the string `s` is not fully numeric.

8. **Mathematical Operations**
	```cpp
	            m = max(m, (int)s.size());
	```
	If the string is not numeric, the function compares the length of the string `s` (converted to an integer) with `m` and updates `m` to the larger value.

9. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return m;
	```
	Returns the maximum value found, either the largest integer found or the maximum length of any non-numeric string.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Average Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input array, as each string is processed once.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a few variables to track the maximum value.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
