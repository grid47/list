Given two integers, `n` and `k`, construct a k-avoiding array of length `n`. A k-avoiding array is an array of distinct positive integers where no two elements sum up to `k`. Return the minimum possible sum of such an array.

### Input Representations 📥
- **Input:** The input consists of two integers `n` and `k`.
- **Example:** `For example, `n = 5, k = 7`.`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= n, k <= 50

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications 📤
- **Output:** Return the minimum possible sum of a k-avoiding array of length `n`.
- **Example:** `For `n = 5, k = 7`, the output is `24`.`
- **Constraints:**

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic 🔍
**Goal:** The goal is to find a valid k-avoiding array and compute its sum.

- Initialize an empty array to store the valid k-avoiding array.
- Iterate through integers, adding them to the array if they don't form a pair that sums to `k` with any previous element.
- Once the array reaches length `n`, return the sum of its elements.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ✅
- The integers `n` and `k` are within the constraints provided.
- The k-avoiding array will have distinct positive integers.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples 🧩
- **Input:** `For `n = 5, k = 7``  \
  **Explanation:** A valid k-avoiding array is `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`, with a sum of `24`, where no pair of numbers sum to `7`.

## Approach 🚀
The solution involves iterating through integers, constructing the k-avoiding array by ensuring no pair sums to `k`, and then returning the minimum possible sum.

### Initial Thoughts 💭
- We need to avoid pairs of numbers in the array that sum up to `k`.
- By selecting the smallest available integers and ensuring no pair sums to `k`, we can minimize the sum.

### Edge Cases 🌐
- An empty array scenario will not be encountered due to problem constraints.
- Ensure the solution works efficiently when `n` and `k` are at their maximum values.
- Consider cases where `n` is small (e.g., 1 or 2), ensuring the solution handles these properly.
- The algorithm must work efficiently within the constraints, ensuring optimal selection of numbers.

## Code 💻
```cpp
int minimumSum(int n, int k) {
    int sum = 0;
    vector<int> vis(51, 0);
    int i = 1;
    while(n > 0 && i <= k) {
        if(!vis[i] && !vis[k - i]) {
            n--;                
            sum += i;
            vis[i] = true;
        }
        i++;
    }
    while(n--) {
        sum += i++;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

This function calculates the minimum sum of distinct integers from 1 to k, with a given number of elements n, while avoiding repetitions.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown 🛠️
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int minimumSum(int n, int k) {
	```
	The function 'minimumSum' is defined, taking two integers 'n' (the number of elements) and 'k' (the upper limit for the sum).

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int sum = 0;
	```
	A variable 'sum' is initialized to 0, which will store the cumulative sum of selected integers.

3. **Array Initialization**
	```cpp
	    vector<int> vis(51, 0);
	```
	A vector 'vis' of size 51 is initialized with all elements set to 0, to keep track of the integers that have been used.

4. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int i = 1;
	```
	The variable 'i' is initialized to 1. It will be used to iterate through integers starting from 1.

5. **Loop Start (Condition Check)**
	```cpp
	    while(n > 0 && i <= k) {
	```
	A while loop starts, which will continue as long as 'n' is greater than 0 and 'i' is less than or equal to 'k'.

6. **Condition Check**
	```cpp
	        if(!vis[i] && !vis[k - i]) {
	```
	An if condition checks whether both 'i' and 'k - i' are not used yet (not marked in the 'vis' vector).

7. **Decrement n**
	```cpp
	            n--;                
	```
	If the condition is met, 'n' is decremented, indicating that one element has been used.

8. **Update Sum**
	```cpp
	            sum += i;
	```
	The current value of 'i' is added to 'sum'. This contributes to the total minimum sum.

9. **Mark as Visited**
	```cpp
	            vis[i] = true;
	```
	The value of 'i' is marked as used by setting 'vis[i]' to true.

10. **Increment i**
	```cpp
	        i++;
	```
	The value of 'i' is incremented to check the next integer.

11. **Second While Loop**
	```cpp
	    while(n--) {
	```
	If there are still elements left (i.e., 'n' is greater than 0), a second while loop begins, incrementing 'i' and adding to the sum.

12. **Add Remaining Integers**
	```cpp
	        sum += i++;
	```
	The value of 'i' is added to 'sum', and 'i' is incremented for the next iteration.

13. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return sum;
	```
	The function returns the total 'sum' calculated.

## Complexity Analysis 📊
### Time Complexity ⏳
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Average Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The time complexity is O(n), as we iterate through integers and check pairs for validity.

### Space Complexity 💾
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The space complexity is O(n) as we store the k-avoiding array, with the worst case requiring space proportional to `n`.

**Happy Coding! 🎉**
