You are tasked with creating a data structure that allows adding words and checking if a word matches any previously added word, with support for the wildcard '.' character.
<!--more-->
{{< dots >}}
### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input consists of calls to the WordDictionary constructor, addWord method, and search method. Words can include lowercase letters and the wildcard '.' character.
- **Example:** `[[], ["hello"], ["world"], ["hell"], ["hell"], ["hello"], ["h.ll"], ["wo.ld"]]`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= word.length <= 25
	- Words consist of lowercase English letters in addWord and lowercase English letters or '.' in search.
	- At most 10^4 calls to addWord and search.

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** For each search query, return true if a matching word exists, otherwise return false.
- **Example:** `For input ["search('hell')"] after adding 'hello' and 'hell', the output will be true.`
- **Constraints:**

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** Implement a data structure that supports efficient addition and search of words, with the ability to match patterns using the '.' wildcard.

- Use a Trie (prefix tree) to store added words.
- For search, use a backtracking approach to explore all possible matching words, considering '.' as a wildcard.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The input will contain lowercase letters and the wildcard '.' character only.
- The system should efficiently handle large numbers of addWord and search calls.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `Example 1`  \
  **Explanation:** After adding 'hello', 'world', and 'hell', searching for 'hell' returns true because 'hell' is an exact match. Searching for 'h.ll' also returns true because 'hello' matches the pattern.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
We can solve this problem using a Trie for storing words and backtracking for searching with patterns containing '.'

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The Trie is an efficient data structure for storing words based on their prefixes.
- Backtracking can be used for searching, especially with the wildcard '.' character.
- We will need to recursively explore all possible matches when encountering a dot in the search string.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- If no words are added, any search will return false.
- The solution should handle cases with large numbers of words and search queries efficiently.
- Search queries containing '.' should match any character in the corresponding position.
- Optimize for time complexity to handle up to 10^4 operations.

## Code üíª
```cpp
bool isWord;
char val;
vector<Node*> next;
Node(char val, bool isWord) {
    this->val = val;
    this->isWord = isWord;
    next.resize(26, NULL);
}
};
class WordDictionary {
public:
Node* root;
WordDictionary() {
    root = new Node(' ', false);
}

void addWord(string word) {
    Node* node = this->root;
    for(int i = 0; i < word.size(); i++) {
        int code = word[i] - 'a';
        if(node->next[code] == NULL) {
            node->next[code] = new Node(word[i], false);
        }
        node = node->next[code];
    }
    node->isWord = true;
}

bool search(string word) {
    return bt(word, this->root, 0);
}

bool bt(string word, Node* node, int idx) {
    if(word[idx] == '.') {
        if(idx + 1 == word.size()) {
            int res = false;
            for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if(node->next[i] != NULL)
                    res |= node->next[i]->isWord;
                if(res) return true;
            }
            return false;
        } else {
            int res = false;
            for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if(node->next[i] != NULL)
                    res |= bt(word, node->next[i], idx+1);
                if(res) return true;
            }
            return false;                
        }
    } else {
        
        int code = word[idx] - 'a';
        if(node->next[code] == NULL)
            return false;
        node = node->next[code];
        if(idx + 1 == word.size())
            return node->isWord;
        return bt(word, node, idx + 1);
    }
}
};

/**
 * Your WordDictionary object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * WordDictionary* obj = new WordDictionary();
 * obj->addWord(word);
 * bool param_2 = obj->search(word);
```

This code defines a WordDictionary class that supports adding words and searching for them, where the search allows for wildcards (represented by '.') in the word.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	bool isWord;
	```
	The 'isWord' variable indicates if the current node represents the end of a word.

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	char val;
	```
	The 'val' variable stores the character that the node represents in the trie structure.

3. **Vector Insertion**
	```cpp
	vector<Node*> next;
	```
	The 'next' vector holds pointers to the next nodes in the trie, with each position corresponding to a character from 'a' to 'z'.

17. **Conditional Statement**
	```cpp
	        if(node->next[code] == NULL) {
	```
	Checks if the node at the corresponding position in the trie is null.

18. **Memory Allocation**

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(m), where m is the length of the word being searched.
- **Average Case:** O(m), assuming an average branching factor for the Trie.
- **Worst Case:** O(m * 26^k), where k is the number of '.' characters in the search query and 26 is the number of possible letters for each dot.

In the worst case, we may need to explore all possible combinations for the dots in the query.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(n), where n is the number of words, assuming each word has a constant length.
- **Worst Case:** O(n * m), where n is the number of words and m is the average length of each word.

The space complexity is mainly determined by the Trie structure, which stores all words and their corresponding characters.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
