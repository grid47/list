You are given an array of positive integers `arr` and an array of queries. For each query `[lefti, righti]`, calculate the XOR of elements from index `lefti` to `righti` (inclusive). Return an array `answer` where each element corresponds to the XOR result of the respective query.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input consists of an array of positive integers and an array of queries, where each query contains two integers representing a range in the array.
- **Example:** `Input: arr = [2, 5, 7, 10], queries = [[0,2],[1,3],[2,3],[0,1]]`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= arr.length, queries.length <= 3 * 10^4
	- 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
	- queries[i].length == 2
	- 0 <= lefti <= righti < arr.length

### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** The output is an array of integers where each element is the XOR result of the corresponding query.
- **Example:** `Output: [4, 5, 13, 7]`
- **Constraints:**
	- Each element of the output corresponds to the XOR result for the respective query.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** Calculate the XOR of elements between indices `lefti` and `righti` for each query efficiently.

- Use prefix XOR array to precompute XOR values for the array.
- For each query, calculate the XOR from the prefix array using the formula: `prefix[righti + 1] ^ prefix[lefti]`.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The array and queries are well-formed and follow the given constraints.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `Input: arr = [2, 5, 7, 10], queries = [[0,2],[1,3],[2,3],[0,1]]`  \
  **Explanation:** The XOR values for queries are computed by applying the XOR operation on the array elements between indices `lefti` and `righti`.

## Approach üöÄ
We can solve the problem efficiently by using a prefix XOR array, which allows us to compute the XOR for any range in constant time.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The XOR of a range of elements can be derived from a prefix XOR array.
- Precompute the XOR for all elements up to index `i` in a prefix array. Then, for each query, the result can be derived in constant time.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- If the array is empty, there are no queries to process.
- For large arrays and queries, ensure that the solution handles up to 30,000 elements efficiently.
- If the elements in the array are all the same, the XOR result for any range may be predictable.
- The solution must handle arrays with up to 30,000 elements and queries efficiently.

## Code üíª
```cpp
vector<int> xorQueries(vector<int>& arr, vector<vector<int>>& q) {
    int n = arr.size();
    vector<int> xr(n +1,0);
    for(int i = 1; i < n +1; i++)
        xr[i] = xr[i - 1] ^ arr[i - 1];
    vector<int> res;
    for(int i = 0; i < q.size(); i++) {
        auto &v = q[i];
        res.push_back(xr[v[1]+1] ^ xr[v[0]]);
     }
    return res;
}
```

This code defines a function 'xorQueries' which performs XOR operations on subarrays based on a list of queries. It computes the cumulative XOR from the start and processes each query to return the XOR of elements in the specified range.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Declaration**
	```cpp
	vector<int> xorQueries(vector<int>& arr, vector<vector<int>>& q) {
	```
	The function 'xorQueries' is defined with two parameters: a vector 'arr' which contains the array elements and a 2D vector 'q' which holds the queries. Each query specifies a range for which the XOR is computed.

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int n = arr.size();
	```
	The variable 'n' is initialized to the size of the input array 'arr'. This value is used to manage array bounds during the processing of queries.

3. **Vector Initialization**
	```cpp
	    vector<int> xr(n +1,0);
	```
	A vector 'xr' is initialized with size 'n+1' to store the cumulative XOR values. The extra space is to handle the prefix sum logic efficiently.

4. **Loop Control**
	```cpp
	    for(int i = 1; i < n +1; i++)
	```
	This for loop starts from index 1 and iterates through the array to compute the cumulative XOR for each element.

5. **XOR Operation**
	```cpp
	        xr[i] = xr[i - 1] ^ arr[i - 1];
	```
	In each iteration, the cumulative XOR at index 'i' is calculated by XORing the previous cumulative value with the current element of the array. This builds a prefix XOR array.

6. **Vector Initialization**
	```cpp
	    vector<int> res;
	```
	An empty vector 'res' is initialized to store the results of each query.

7. **Loop Control**
	```cpp
	    for(int i = 0; i < q.size(); i++) {
	```
	This loop iterates through each query in the 2D vector 'q'. Each query specifies a range of indices for which the XOR operation needs to be performed.

8. **Query Processing**
	```cpp
	        auto &v = q[i];
	```
	The current query is extracted by referencing the query vector 'v', which contains two indices representing the range for XOR computation.

9. **XOR Operation**
	```cpp
	        res.push_back(xr[v[1]+1] ^ xr[v[0]]);
	```
	The XOR for the range specified by the query is calculated using the prefix XOR array 'xr'. The result is pushed to the 'res' vector.

10. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return res;
	```
	The function returns the 'res' vector, which contains the results of all the XOR queries.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n) - The best case occurs when all queries are processed after building the prefix XOR array.
- **Average Case:** O(n + m) - Where n is the length of the array and m is the number of queries.
- **Worst Case:** O(n + m) - The worst case involves processing all queries with the prefix XOR array.

The time complexity is O(n + m), where n is the length of the array and m is the number of queries.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(n) - The best case still requires space for the prefix XOR array.
- **Worst Case:** O(n) - The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the prefix XOR array.

The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
