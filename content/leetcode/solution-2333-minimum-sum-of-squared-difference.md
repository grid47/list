{{< dots >}}
### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** Two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of length n, and two integers k1 and k2.
- **Example:** `nums1 = [10, 20, 30], nums2 = [1, 15, 35], k1 = 2, k2 = 3`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= n <= 10^5
	- 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^5
	- 0 <= k1, k2 <= 10^9

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the minimum possible sum of squared differences after modifying the elements of nums1 and nums2 as described.
- **Example:** `50`
- **Constraints:**
	- The result must be a non-negative integer.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** Minimize the sum of squared differences by adjusting elements of nums1 and nums2 under given constraints.

- Calculate the initial squared differences between nums1 and nums2.
- Determine the amount of adjustment possible based on k1 and k2 for each element.
- Apply the adjustments in a way that minimizes the overall squared difference.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- You are allowed to modify the elements of nums1 and nums2 within the provided limits of k1 and k2.
- The arrays nums1 and nums2 can be modified independently.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `nums1 = [5, 12, 8], nums2 = [3, 9, 5], k1 = 1, k2 = 2`  \
  **Explanation:** By adjusting nums1[0] by +1 and nums2[2] by -2, the minimum sum of squared differences is achieved.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
To minimize the sum of squared differences, adjust the elements of nums1 and nums2 intelligently using k1 and k2 to reduce the largest differences first.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The sum of squared differences is sensitive to large differences between corresponding elements.
- The optimal approach involves reducing these differences while respecting the available modification limits.
- Start by computing the initial sum of squared differences.
- Determine which elements can be adjusted most effectively with the given k1 and k2 values.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- If nums1 and nums2 are empty, the result should be 0.
- For very large inputs, the solution should handle the constraints efficiently.
- If k1 or k2 is 0, no modifications can be made, and the sum of squared differences remains unchanged.
- Handle cases where the elements in nums1 and nums2 are already very close.

## Code üíª
```cpp
long long minSumSquareDiff(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2, int k1, int k2) {

    int n = nums1.size();
    vector<long long> diff(n, 0);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    diff[i] = abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);

    long long m = *max_element(diff.begin(), diff.end());
    int k = k1 + k2;

    vector<long long> bck(m + 1, 0);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        bck[diff[i]]++;

    for(int i = m; i > 0; i--)
        if (bck[i] > 0) {
            long long num     = min(bck[i], (long long) k);
            bck[i]     -= num;
            bck[i - 1] += num;
            k -= num;
            if (k == 0) break;
        }

    long long res = 0;
    for(long long i = 0; i < m + 1; i++)
     res += bck[i] * (i * i);

    return res;
}
```

This function calculates the minimum sum of squared differences between two lists `nums1` and `nums2` after performing up to `k1` and `k2` operations to adjust the values of the lists. It uses a greedy approach with a counting strategy to minimize the difference.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Declaration**
	```cpp
	long long minSumSquareDiff(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2, int k1, int k2) {
	```
	Declares the function `minSumSquareDiff` that calculates the minimum sum of squared differences between two integer arrays after adjusting their values using up to `k1` and `k2` operations.

2. **Array Size Calculation**
	```cpp
	    int n = nums1.size();
	```
	Calculates the size of the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, storing it in variable `n`.

3. **Difference Array Initialization**
	```cpp
	    vector<long long> diff(n, 0);
	```
	Initializes an array `diff` to store the absolute differences between the elements of `nums1` and `nums2`.

4. **Loop Through Arrays**
	```cpp
	    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	```
	Loops through the arrays `nums1` and `nums2` to calculate the absolute differences.

5. **Calculate Differences**
	```cpp
	    diff[i] = abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
	```
	Calculates the absolute difference between corresponding elements in `nums1` and `nums2` and stores it in the `diff` array.

6. **Find Maximum Difference**
	```cpp
	    long long m = *max_element(diff.begin(), diff.end());
	```
	Finds the maximum difference in the `diff` array to determine the range of possible values for adjustments.

7. **Total Operations Calculation**
	```cpp
	    int k = k1 + k2;
	```
	Calculates the total number of operations (`k1` and `k2`) available to adjust the values.

8. **Count Occurrences of Differences**
	```cpp
	    vector<long long> bck(m + 1, 0);
	```
	Initializes a backup array `bck` to store the count of each difference value.

9. **Loop Through Differences**
	```cpp
	    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	```
	Loops through the `diff` array to count the occurrences of each difference value.

10. **Update Count Array**
	```cpp
	        bck[diff[i]]++;
	```
	Increments the count of the current difference in the backup array `bck`.

11. **Loop Through Differences in Reverse**
	```cpp
	    for(int i = m; i > 0; i--)
	```
	Starts a loop from the maximum difference down to 1 to try and minimize the differences with available operations.

12. **Check if Adjustments are Possible**
	```cpp
	        if (bck[i] > 0) {
	```
	Checks if there are any occurrences of the current difference `i` that can be adjusted.

13. **Calculate Number of Adjustments**
	```cpp
	            long long num     = min(bck[i], (long long) k);
	```
	Calculates the number of adjustments that can be made for the current difference, based on the available operations.

14. **Update Count Array After Adjustments**
	```cpp
	            bck[i]     -= num;
	```
	Decreases the count of the current difference by the number of adjustments made.

15. **Update Lower Difference Count**
	```cpp
	            bck[i - 1] += num;
	```
	Increases the count of the next lower difference by the number of adjustments made.

16. **Update Remaining Operations**
	```cpp
	            k -= num;
	```
	Reduces the remaining number of operations by the number of adjustments made.

17. **Check if Operations Are Exhausted**
	```cpp
	            if (k == 0) break;
	```
	Checks if all available operations have been used, and if so, breaks out of the loop.

18. **Initialize Result**
	```cpp
	    long long res = 0;
	```
	Initializes the result variable `res` to store the final sum of squared differences.

19. **Sum of Squared Differences**
	```cpp
	    for(long long i = 0; i < m + 1; i++)
	```
	Loops through the `bck` array to calculate the sum of squared differences.

20. **Accumulate Squared Differences**
	```cpp
	     res += bck[i] * (i * i);
	```
	Accumulates the sum of squared differences using the counts from the `bck` array.

21. **Return Result**
	```cpp
	    return res;
	```
	Returns the final result, which is the minimum sum of squared differences after the adjustments.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n log n) for sorting and calculating differences.
- **Average Case:** O(n log n) for sorting and updating the elements.
- **Worst Case:** O(n log n) due to sorting, which is the most time-consuming operation.

The complexity is dominated by the sorting step.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(n) for storing differences and counts.
- **Worst Case:** O(n) for storing differences and counts.

Space complexity is linear in terms of the number of elements in nums1 and nums2.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
