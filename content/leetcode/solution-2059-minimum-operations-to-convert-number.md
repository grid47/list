You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, containing distinct numbers, an integer start, and an integer goal. There is an integer x, initially set to start, and you need to transform x into goal by repeatedly performing operations. You can use any number from the array nums in the following ways: x + nums[i], x - nums[i], or x ^ nums[i] (bitwise-XOR). You can perform each operation any number of times in any order. If the resulting number goes outside the range 0 <= x <= 1000, no further operations can be performed. The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to convert x from start to goal, or return -1 if it is not possible.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** You are provided with the following input parameters:
- **Example:** `Input: nums = [4, 5, 6], start = 3, goal = 9`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
	- -10^9 <= nums[i], goal <= 10^9
	- 0 <= start <= 1000
	- start != goal
	- All elements in nums are distinct.

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the minimum number of operations required to transform start to goal using the operations described, or -1 if it is not possible.
- **Example:** `Output: 2`
- **Constraints:**
	- The result must be a non-negative integer or -1.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations to transform the number start into goal using the operations provided. The strategy involves exploring all possible transformations using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach.

- 1. Initialize a queue and a set to track seen numbers.
- 2. Perform a breadth-first search, starting with the value 'start'.
- 3. For each number x, generate new numbers by performing the operations x + nums[i], x - nums[i], and x ^ nums[i], ensuring they are within the allowed range (0 <= x <= 1000).
- 4. Check if any of the new numbers equal goal, and return the current number of operations.
- 5. If no solution is found, return -1.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The numbers in the nums array are distinct.
- Both start and goal are integers within the range [0, 1000].
- If no valid transformation sequence exists, return -1.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `Input: nums = [2,4,12], start = 2, goal = 12`  \
  **Explanation:** We can go from 2 ‚Üí 14 ‚Üí 12 with the following operations: 2 + 12 = 14, then 14 - 2 = 12. This requires 2 operations.

- **Input:** `Input: nums = [3,5,7], start = 0, goal = -4`  \
  **Explanation:** We can go from 0 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí -4 with the following operations: 0 + 3 = 3, then 3 - 7 = -4. This requires 2 operations.

- **Input:** `Input: nums = [2,8,16], start = 0, goal = 1`  \
  **Explanation:** It is impossible to reach 1 starting from 0 with the given nums, so the output is -1.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
The problem is best solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy. BFS is ideal here as it explores all possible transformations level by level, ensuring the minimum number of operations is found.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- We need to explore all possible transformations of x from start to goal.
- BFS will allow us to find the shortest path of transformations.
- Since BFS explores level by level, it ensures we find the minimum number of operations to reach the goal.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- There will always be at least one number in nums, so no need to handle empty input.
- Handle cases where nums contains a large number of elements efficiently (up to 1000).
- Ensure the algorithm handles edge cases like unreachable goals or cases where transformations take the number out of the allowed range.
- The BFS should be optimized to avoid unnecessary computations and to handle the constraints efficiently.

## Code üíª
```cpp
int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums, int start, int goal) {
    
    queue<int> q;
    set<int> seen;
    q.push(start);
    seen.insert(start);
    int op = 0;
    while(!q.empty()) {
        int sz = q.size();
        op++;
        while(sz--) {
            int x = q.front();
            q.pop();
            for(auto it: nums) {
                if((x + it) == goal || (x - it) == goal || (x ^ it) == goal)
                    return op;
                
                if(!seen.count(x + it) && x + it <= 1000 && x + it >= 0) {
                    seen.insert(x + it);                        
                    q.push(x + it);
                }
                
                if(!seen.count(x - it) && x - it <= 1000 && x - it >= 0) {
                    seen.insert(x - it);
                    q.push(x - it);
                }             
                
                if(!seen.count(x ^ it) && (x ^ it) <= 1000 && (x ^ it) >= 0) {
                    seen.insert(x ^ it);
                    q.push(x ^ it);
                }                    
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
    
}
```

This function finds the minimum number of operations required to reach a 'goal' from a 'start' using a sequence of operations (+, -, ^) applied to elements from the 'nums' vector, using a BFS approach.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums, int start, int goal) {
	```
	Initialize the function 'minimumOperations' which takes in a vector 'nums' and two integers 'start' and 'goal' to calculate the minimum operations required.

2. **Queue Initialization**
	```cpp
	    queue<int> q;
	```
	Initialize a queue 'q' for BFS traversal to explore the different possible values.

3. **Set Initialization**
	```cpp
	    set<int> seen;
	```
	Create a set 'seen' to store the values that have already been processed, ensuring no value is revisited.

4. **Queue Operations**
	```cpp
	    q.push(start);
	```
	Push the initial 'start' value into the queue to begin the BFS search.

5. **Set Operations**
	```cpp
	    seen.insert(start);
	```
	Insert the 'start' value into the 'seen' set to mark it as processed.

6. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int op = 0;

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Average Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in nums, as we explore all possible transformations in BFS.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The space complexity is O(n) due to the queue and the set used to track visited numbers.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
