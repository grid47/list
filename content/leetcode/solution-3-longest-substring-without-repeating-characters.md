### üîç **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** ‚Äì Explained Simply!

In the **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** problem, we are given a string `s`, and we need to determine the **length of the longest substring** that contains unique characters (no repeats). This problem is often encountered in algorithmic challenges and tests your ability to efficiently manage substring uniqueness.

### üìù **Problem Statement**

**Input**: 
- A string `s`, consisting of characters.

**Output**: 
- An integer representing the **length of the longest substring** of `s` with all unique characters.

### üí° **Key Idea: Sliding Window with Hashmap**

To tackle this problem efficiently, we‚Äôll use a **sliding window** approach combined with a **hashmap**. The sliding window helps manage the substring boundaries, while the hashmap enables us to quickly track characters and their most recent positions, allowing us to keep the substring unique.

#### **Steps to Solve the Problem:**

1. **Sliding Window**: Use a window that slides across the string. The window will expand as we move right and adjust (shrink from the left) when duplicate characters are found.
   
2. **Hashmap**: Use a hashmap to store each character's **latest index** in the string. This lets us know where to adjust the left boundary if a repeated character is encountered.

3. **Calculate Length**: As we slide the window, we continuously calculate the length of the current valid substring and track the maximum length found.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

```cpp
int prv = -1, len = 0;  // Previous boundary index and max length
map<char, int> mp;  // Map to store characters and their latest positions
```

- `prv`: Represents the **left boundary** of the window, initialized to `-1` (before the start of the string).
- `len`: Stores the length of the **longest valid substring** found.
- `mp`: A hashmap that stores the **latest index** of each character encountered, allowing quick access and efficient window adjustment.

#### Step 2: Traverse the String

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
    if(mp.count(s[i])) 
        prv = max(prv, mp[s[i]]);  // Update left boundary to avoid duplicate
    mp[s[i]] = i;  // Update the latest index of the character
    len = max(len, i - prv);  // Calculate length of current valid substring
}
```

- **Loop through each character** (`i` is the current index):
  - **Check for duplicates**:
    - If `s[i]` is already in `mp`, it means we‚Äôve seen this character before.
    - **Adjust left boundary**: `prv = max(prv, mp[s[i]])` ensures `prv` moves right to the latest occurrence of `s[i]`.
  - **Update the hashmap**: Set `mp[s[i]] = i`, marking `s[i]`'s latest position.
  - **Calculate the length**: `len = max(len, i - prv)` updates `len` if the current substring (from `prv` to `i`) is the longest so far.

#### Step 3: Return the Maximum Length

```cpp
return len;
```

- After processing the string, `len` will hold the length of the longest substring without repeating characters, which we return as the result.

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We perform a single pass through `s`, with each operation inside the loop (hashmap access and updates) taking constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(min(n, m))**, where `n` is the length of the string, and `m` is the size of the character set. The hashmap `mp` stores at most one entry per unique character in `s`.

### üåü **Why This Solution Works**

This solution is efficient and intuitive:
- **Single Pass (O(n) Time)**: The sliding window ensures each character is processed once.
- **Efficient Window Adjustment**: The hashmap enables quick lookups to reposition the left boundary, maintaining uniqueness within the window.

### üèÜ **In Summary**

This approach makes it easy to tackle the **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** by combining a sliding window with a hashmap. With this method, we can solve the problem in linear time, making it well-suited for large strings. This technique is useful not only for solving similar substring problems but also for real-world applications involving efficient string processing.
