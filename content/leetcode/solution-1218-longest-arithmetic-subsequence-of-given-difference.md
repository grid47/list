### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** You are given an integer array arr and an integer difference.
- **Example:** `Input: arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], difference = 2`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
	- -10^4 <= arr[i], difference <= 10^4

### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the length of the longest subsequence where the difference between adjacent elements equals the given difference.
- **Example:** `Output: 5`
- **Constraints:**

### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** The goal is to find the longest subsequence of numbers that have a constant difference between adjacent elements.

- Use a map to store the length of the longest subsequence ending at each element.
- For each element in the array, check if there is a subsequence ending at the previous element that can be extended with the current element.
- Update the map and keep track of the longest subsequence found.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The input array may contain both positive and negative integers.
- The difference can be both positive and negative.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `Input: arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], difference = 2`  \
  **Explanation:** The entire array forms an arithmetic subsequence with a common difference of 2.

- **Input:** `Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], difference = 3`  \
  **Explanation:** The longest subsequence with a difference of 3 is [1, 4].

## Approach üöÄ
We can use dynamic programming with a hashmap to efficiently track the longest subsequence for each element.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- Each element in the array can potentially extend a subsequence if it forms a valid arithmetic progression with the previous element.
- We will use a map to store the longest subsequence that ends with each element and update it as we iterate through the array.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- The input array will always have at least one element, as per the constraints.
- The solution should be efficient enough to handle arrays of length up to 10^5.
- Consider cases where the entire array is a valid arithmetic subsequence or when no subsequence forms.
- The solution should work within the given time and space limits.

## Code üíª
```cpp
int longestSubsequence(vector<int>& arr, int diff) {
    map<int, int> mp;
    int ans = 1;
    for(int x: arr) {
        mp[x] = 1 + max(mp[x - diff], mp.count(x)? mp[x] -1 :0);
        ans = max(ans, mp[x]);
    }
    return ans;
}
```

This function finds the length of the longest subsequence in the given array `arr` where the difference between consecutive elements is exactly `diff`. It uses dynamic programming with a hashmap to store the longest subsequence length for each element.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int longestSubsequence(vector<int>& arr, int diff) {
	```
	Define the function `longestSubsequence` which takes a vector `arr` and an integer `diff` as input, where `diff` is the required difference between consecutive elements in the subsequence.

2. **Map Initialization**
	```cpp
	    map<int, int> mp;
	```
	Initialize a map `mp` where the key is an element from `arr`, and the value is the length of the longest subsequence ending with that element.

3. **Answer Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int ans = 1;
	```
	Initialize `ans` to 1, which will store the length of the longest subsequence found so far. The minimum subsequence length is 1 (the element itself).

4. **Loop Through Array**
	```cpp
	    for(int x: arr) {
	```
	Start a loop to iterate through each element `x` in the input array `arr`.

5. **Update Map with Subsequence Length**
	```cpp
	        mp[x] = 1 + max(mp[x - diff], mp.count(x)? mp[x] -1 :0);
	```
	For each element `x`, update the map `mp`. The new value is 1 plus the maximum of two cases: the length of the subsequence that ends with `x - diff` or the length of the subsequence ending with `x`, adjusted if it exists.

6. **Update Maximum Length**
	```cpp
	        ans = max(ans, mp[x]);
	```
	Update `ans` to be the maximum of the current `ans` and the subsequence length ending at `x`. This ensures that the longest subsequence length is stored.

7. **Return Result**
	```cpp
	    return ans;
	```
	Return the length of the longest subsequence found.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Average Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, as we process each element once.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of subsequence lengths in the map.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
