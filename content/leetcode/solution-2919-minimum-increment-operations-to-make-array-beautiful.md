You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`. You can perform an operation where you pick an index `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]` and increment `nums[i]` by 1. You can perform this operation any number of times (including zero). A subarray is considered beautiful if, for every subarray of size 3 or more, the maximum element in that subarray is greater than or equal to `k`. Your task is to return the minimum number of increment operations needed to make the array beautiful.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input consists of a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.
- **Example:** `nums = [4, 1, 0, 3, 0], k = 6`
- **Constraints:**
	- 3 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5
	- 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
	- 0 <= k <= 10^9

### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the minimum number of increment operations needed to make the array beautiful.
- **Example:** `Output: 4`
- **Constraints:**
	- The output must be an integer.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** We need to increment values in the array such that for every subarray of size 3 or more, the maximum value is greater than or equal to `k`.

- For each element in the array, check how many increments are needed to make it greater than or equal to `k`.
- For each element, determine the minimum number of operations required to ensure all subarrays with size 3 or more satisfy the condition.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The array has at least three elements.
- The value of `k` is non-negative.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `Input: nums = [4, 1, 0, 3, 0], k = 6`  \
  **Explanation:** We perform the minimum number of increment operations to ensure that all subarrays of size 3 or more have a maximum value of at least 6. The answer is 4.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
The problem can be solved by iterating over the array and counting the minimum number of operations required to ensure that every subarray of size 3 or more has a maximum value that meets or exceeds `k`.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The solution needs to minimize the number of operations while ensuring the condition is met for every subarray of size 3 or more.
- We can achieve this by iterating over the array and performing the minimum number of increments necessary to make every element greater than or equal to `k` where required.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- The input will always contain at least three elements.
- The solution should be optimized to handle up to 10^5 elements efficiently.
- When `k` is 0, no increments are needed if all elements are already non-negative.
- We assume that the constraints are satisfied as given.

## Code üíª
```cpp
long long minIncrementOperations(vector<int>& A, int k) {
    long long dp1 = 0, dp2 = 0, dp3 = 0, dp;
    for (int& a: A) {
        dp = min(dp1, min(dp2, dp3)) + max(k - a, 0);
        dp1 = dp2;
        dp2 = dp3;
        dp3 = dp;
    }
    return min(dp1, min(dp2, dp3));
}
```

This function calculates the minimum increment operations needed to make all elements in the array greater than or equal to a value 'k'. It uses dynamic programming to track the minimum number of operations for each step and returns the result.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	long long minIncrementOperations(vector<int>& A, int k) {
	```
	Defines the function 'minIncrementOperations' which takes an array 'A' and an integer 'k', returning the minimum number of operations to make each element of the array greater than or equal to 'k'.

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    long long dp1 = 0, dp2 = 0, dp3 = 0, dp;
	```
	Initializes four long long variables: dp1, dp2, dp3 for dynamic programming state storage and dp for the current operation calculation.

3. **Loop Over Array**
	```cpp
	    for (int& a: A) {
	```
	Iterates through the array 'A', using reference to modify each element if necessary.

4. **Dynamic Programming Update**
	```cpp
	        dp = min(dp1, min(dp2, dp3)) + max(k - a, 0);
	```
	Calculates the minimum number of operations needed by considering the previous dynamic programming states (dp1, dp2, dp3) and the difference between 'k' and the current element 'a'.

5. **State Transition**
	```cpp
	        dp1 = dp2;
	```
	Updates dp1 to the value of dp2 for the next iteration, preparing for the dynamic programming transition.

6. **State Transition**
	```cpp
	        dp2 = dp3;
	```
	Updates dp2 to the value of dp3 for the next iteration, continuing the dynamic programming state transition.

7. **State Transition**
	```cpp
	        dp3 = dp;
	```
	Sets dp3 to the current value of dp, completing the state transition for dynamic programming.

8. **Return Result**
	```cpp
	    return min(dp1, min(dp2, dp3));
	```
	Returns the minimum value among dp1, dp2, and dp3, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to make each element of 'A' greater than or equal to 'k'.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- **Average Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

We iterate over the array once, performing constant-time operations for each element.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1), since no extra space is used beyond a few variables.

The solution uses constant space.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
