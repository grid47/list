### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** You are given a 2D grid, where each element is either 0 or 1.
- **Example:** `Input: grid = [[1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]]`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= grid.length <= 100
	- 1 <= grid[0].length <= 100
	- grid[i][j] is 0 or 1

### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the number of elements in the largest square subgrid with 1s on its border and 0s inside.
- **Example:** `Output: 9`
- **Constraints:**
	- The output will be an integer representing the area of the largest square subgrid.

### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** Find the largest square subgrid with all 1s on its border and 0s inside.

- 1. Use dynamic programming to calculate the largest possible square that can be formed at each point.
- 2. Check the border elements of possible square subgrids to ensure they meet the condition of having 1s along the borders.
- 3. Return the area of the largest valid square found.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The grid contains only 0s and 1s.
- We are looking for squares where the border consists of 1s and the inside is filled with 0s.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `Input: grid = [[1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]]`  \
  **Explanation:** In this example, the largest square with all 1s on its border is the entire 3x3 grid, which has 9 elements.

- **Input:** `Input: grid = [[1, 1, 0, 0]]`  \
  **Explanation:** Here, the only valid square is the top-left corner, which is a 1x1 square with 1 on its border, giving an output of 1.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
The goal is to find the largest square subgrid with 1s on its border and 0s inside, using dynamic programming to check possible squares and validate their borders.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- Dynamic programming can be used to store the size of the largest square that can end at each point.
- We need to ensure the border of the square is composed of 1s and the inside is 0s.
- The problem is a typical dynamic programming problem where we compute the largest square at each point and then check if it satisfies the condition of having 1s on the border and 0s inside.

### Edge Cases üåê
- An empty grid will not be given as per the constraints.
- The solution should efficiently handle grids of size 100x100.
- Grids where no valid square exists should return 0.
- The solution must be efficient enough to handle the upper limits of grid size (100x100).

## Code üíª
```cpp
int largest1BorderedSquare(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
    
    vector<vector<int>> top(m, vector<int>(n, 0)), left(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
    
    for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        if(grid[i][j] > 0) {
            top[i][j] = i > 0? 1 + top[i - 1][j]: 1;
            left[i][j] = j > 0? 1 + left[i][j - 1]: 1;
        }
    
    for(int l = min(m, n); l >= 1; l--) {
        for(int i = 0; i < m - l + 1; i++)
        for(int j = 0; j < n - l + 1; j++)
            if(top[i + l - 1][j] >= l &&
               top[i + l - 1][j + l - 1] >= l &&
              left[i][j + l - 1] >= l &&
              left[i + l - 1][j + l - 1] >= l)
                return l * l;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This function finds the largest square that can be formed from '1's in a given 2D grid. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the size of potential squares by storing the maximum consecutive '1's found at each position in the 'top' and 'left' arrays.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int largest1BorderedSquare(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
	```
	This defines the function `largest1BorderedSquare`, which takes a reference to a 2D vector `grid` and returns an integer representing the area of the largest square with a border of '1's.

2. **Matrix Dimensions**
	```cpp
	    int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
	```
	This line initializes two variables, `m` and `n`, to store the number of rows and columns in the input `grid` respectively.

3. **DP Arrays Initialization**
	```cpp
	    vector<vector<int>> top(m, vector<int>(n, 0)), left(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
	```
	This line initializes two 2D vectors, `top` and `left`, both with dimensions `m` x `n`, and fills them with zeros. These vectors will store the length of consecutive '1's up to each position in the grid (vertically for `top`, and horizontally for `left`).

4. **Loop Through Grid**
	```cpp
	    for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
	```
	This starts a loop iterating over each row of the grid.

5. **Loop Through Grid Columns**
	```cpp
	    for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
	```
	This nested loop iterates through each column of the grid in the current row.

6. **Check for '1'**
	```cpp
	        if(grid[i][j] > 0) {
	```
	This `if` statement checks if the current cell in the grid contains a '1'. If so, it calculates the maximum length of consecutive '1's for this position.

7. **Top Array Update**
	```cpp
	            top[i][j] = i > 0? 1 + top[i - 1][j]: 1;
	```
	If the current cell contains a '1', this line updates the `top` array at position `(i, j)` to store the length of consecutive '1's in the column, including the current cell.

8. **Left Array Update**
	```cpp
	            left[i][j] = j > 0? 1 + left[i][j - 1]: 1;
	```
	This line updates the `left` array at position `(i, j)` to store the length of consecutive '1's in the row, including the current cell.

9. **Square Size Search**
	```cpp
	    for(int l = min(m, n); l >= 1; l--) {
	```
	This `for` loop searches for the largest possible square that can be formed. It starts with the largest possible square size `l` (which is the minimum of the grid's dimensions) and decrements until it finds a valid square.

10. **Search Rows**
	```cpp
	        for(int i = 0; i < m - l + 1; i++)
	```
	This nested loop iterates through all possible starting positions for a square of size `l` in the rows.

11. **Search Columns**
	```cpp
	        for(int j = 0; j < n - l + 1; j++)
	```
	This nested loop iterates through all possible starting positions for a square of size `l` in the columns.

12. **Square Validity Check**
	```cpp
	            if(top[i + l - 1][j] >= l &&
	```
	This checks if the top row of the current square of size `l` contains enough consecutive '1's (using the `top` array).

13. **Square Validity Check**
	```cpp
	               top[i + l - 1][j + l - 1] >= l &&
	```
	This checks if the top-right corner of the current square contains enough consecutive '1's.

14. **Square Validity Check**
	```cpp
	              left[i][j + l - 1] >= l &&
	```
	This checks if the left column of the current square contains enough consecutive '1's (using the `left` array).

15. **Square Validity Check**
	```cpp
	              left[i + l - 1][j + l - 1] >= l)
	```
	This checks if the bottom-left corner of the current square contains enough consecutive '1's.

16. **Return Area of Largest Square**
	```cpp
	                return l * l;
	```
	If a valid square of size `l` is found, the function returns the area of the square (i.e., `l * l`).

17. **Return 0**
	```cpp
	    return 0;
	```
	If no square is found, the function returns 0, indicating that no valid square exists in the grid.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(m * n)
- **Average Case:** O(m * n)
- **Worst Case:** O(m * n)

The algorithm checks each cell in the grid and performs a constant-time operation for each, leading to a time complexity of O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(m * n)
- **Worst Case:** O(m * n)

The space complexity is O(m * n) due to the storage of additional 2D arrays `top` and `left`.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
