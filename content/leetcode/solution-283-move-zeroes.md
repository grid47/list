### üöÄ Problem Statement

The challenge here is to **move all zeroes in a given array** `nums` to the end, without changing the order of non-zero elements. And here‚Äôs the twist: we want to do this with an efficient **O(n)** time complexity and **O(1)** extra space.

For example:
- **Input:** `nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`
- **Output:** `nums = [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`

See how all the zeroes are at the end while the other numbers stay in order? Let‚Äôs dive into how we can achieve this efficiently!

### üîç Approach

To solve this problem, we‚Äôll use a classic **two-pointer technique**. This method allows us to traverse the list and rearrange it without needing extra space‚Äîjust a simple, efficient, in-place modification.

**Main Idea:**
1. **Pointer `i`:** Moves through each element in the array.
2. **Pointer `j`:** Tracks where the next non-zero element should go.

As we move through the array, every time we find a non-zero element, we swap it with the element at position `j` (the spot where the next non-zero belongs). Then, we move `j` forward to prep it for the next non-zero.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

#### Step 1: Initialize Pointer `j`
```cpp
int j = 0;
```
- Here, `j` starts at `0`. This is the position where the next non-zero element should be placed.

#### Step 2: Traverse the Array with Pointer `i`
```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
    if(nums[i] != 0)
        swap(nums[i], nums[j]), j++;
}
```
- We iterate through each element in `nums`.
- Every time we encounter a non-zero (`nums[i] != 0`), we swap it with `nums[j]`.
    - This swap puts the non-zero element in the correct place at the front.
    - Then, we move `j` to the next spot where a non-zero element should go.
- By the end, all non-zero elements are clustered at the beginning in the correct order.

#### Step 3: Fill the Remaining Positions with Zeroes
```cpp
while(j < nums.size())
    nums[j++] = 0;
```
- Once all non-zero elements are at the front, `j` will be at the first position where a zero should go.
- We then set each remaining position (from `j` onward) to zero.

### üìä Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity
- **O(n):** We process each element in the array once in the main loop, and the second loop fills in zeroes in **O(n)** worst-case time.
- Both loops combined give an overall time complexity of **O(n)**.

#### Space Complexity
- **O(1):** The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space‚Äîno additional arrays or data structures needed. Everything is done in-place.

---

### üéØ Conclusion

This solution efficiently moves all zeroes to the end while keeping the relative order of non-zero elements intact. Using the **two-pointer technique** gives us an optimal **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space complexity, making it a great fit for performance-sensitive applications.

#### Key Takeaways:
- **Optimal Efficiency:** **O(n)** time complexity for fast performance.
- **In-Place Solution:** **O(1)** space complexity‚Äîmodifies the array without extra memory.
- **Preserves Order:** Keeps non-zero elements in their original order.

The two-pointer approach is a fantastic way to handle similar array rearrangement problems, making it a valuable technique in your toolkit! Keep up the good work, and happy coding! üòä
