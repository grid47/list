Given a binary tree, a target node within the tree, and a non-negative integer k, determine all the nodes that are exactly k edges away from the target node. Return these node values as a list in any order.

{{< dots >}}
### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input includes the root of a binary tree, a target node within the tree, and an integer k.
- **Example:** `root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,6], target = 2, k = 1`
- **Constraints:**
	- The binary tree has between 1 and 500 nodes.
	- All node values are unique and in the range [0, 500].
	- The target node is guaranteed to exist in the tree.
	- 0 <= k <= 1000.

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return a list of all node values that are k edges away from the target node.
- **Example:** `Output: [4, 5, 1]`
- **Constraints:**
	- Output can be in any order.
	- If no nodes are at distance k, return an empty list.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** Identify all nodes exactly k edges away from the given target node in the binary tree.

- Store parent-child relationships of all nodes using a map.
- Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) starting from the target node.
- Track visited nodes to avoid revisiting and looping.
- Stop the search when the depth equals k and collect the values of nodes at this depth.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The binary tree is finite with no cyclic references.
- Node values are distinct.
- The tree includes the specified target node.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,6], target = 2, k = 1`  \
  **Explanation:** Nodes at distance 1 from target node 2 are nodes 4, 5, and 1. Output: [4, 5, 1].

- **Input:** `Input: root = [7], target = 7, k = 3`  \
  **Explanation:** The tree contains only one node, so no nodes are at distance 3. Output: [].

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
Use a combination of DFS to track parent-child relationships and BFS to find nodes at a specified distance.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The problem requires traversing the tree in both directions: parent-to-child and child-to-parent.
- Using BFS will efficiently find nodes at a specific distance.
- Start by mapping parent relationships for all nodes.
- Perform a level-order traversal (BFS) from the target node to collect nodes at the required depth.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- Tree is empty (should not occur per constraints).
- Tree contains the maximum number of nodes, k is very large (e.g., k > tree height).
- Tree has only one node, k > 0.
- Ensure k = 0 returns the value of the target node.

## Code üíª
```cpp
class Solution {
map<TreeNode*, TreeNode*> mp;
set<TreeNode*> st;
vector<int> ans;

void parents(TreeNode* node) {
    if(!node) return;
    if(node->left) {
        mp[node->left] = node;
        parents(node->left);
    }

    if(node->right) {
        mp[node->right] = node;
        parents(node->right);
    }
}
public:
vector<int> distanceK(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* target, int k) {
    if(!root) return {};
    parents(root);

    dfs(target, k);
    return ans;
}

void dfs(TreeNode* node, int k) {
    if(st.count(node)) return;
    st.insert(node);

    if(k == 0) {
        ans.push_back(node->val);
        return;
    }

    if(node->left) dfs(node->left, k - 1);
    if(node->right) dfs(node->right, k - 1);
    if(mp[node]) dfs(mp[node], k - 1);
}

```

This code defines a class Solution that finds all nodes at a distance k from a target node in a binary tree. It utilizes depth-first search (DFS) and a helper function for tracking parent nodes to traverse the tree.

6. **Conditional Check**

8. **Map Operation**
	```cpp

	Store the left child and its parent in the 'mp' map.

9. **Recursive Call**
	```cpp
	        parents(node->left);
	```
	Recursively call the 'parents' method on the left child.

10. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	    if(node->right) {

23. **Action on Base Case**

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Average Case:** O(N), since each node and edge is visited once.
- **Worst Case:** O(N), if k equals the tree height or the tree is skewed.

The complexity is dominated by traversing the tree and performing BFS.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(1), if only the target node exists.
- **Worst Case:** O(N), due to the parent map and BFS queue.

Space usage depends on the map for parent references and BFS queue.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
