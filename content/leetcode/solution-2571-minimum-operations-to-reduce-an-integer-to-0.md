You are given a positive integer n. You can perform the following operation any number of times: Add or subtract a power of 2 from n. Your goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to make n equal to 0.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input consists of a positive integer n.
- **Example:** `For example, n = 15.`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= n <= 10^5

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the minimum number of operations required to make n equal to 0.
- **Example:** `For n = 15, the output is 4.`
- **Constraints:**
	- The result must be an integer representing the minimum number of operations.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** The goal is to minimize the number of operations required to reduce the number n to 0 by adding or subtracting powers of 2.

- 1. Use dynamic programming (or recursion) to evaluate the minimum number of operations needed to reach 0.
- 2. In each operation, subtract or add the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- n is always a positive integer.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `For n = 15, the output is 4.`  \
  **Explanation:** We subtract powers of 2 in the following steps: 15 - 8 = 7, 7 - 4 = 3, 3 - 2 = 1, 1 - 1 = 0. Thus, we need 4 operations.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
The approach uses dynamic programming or recursion to break down the problem. By analyzing how powers of 2 can be added or subtracted, we can compute the minimum number of steps required.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- Powers of 2 (such as 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.) are the key to solving the problem efficiently.
- Dynamic programming allows us to minimize operations by storing intermediate results to avoid recomputation.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- n will always be positive as per the problem constraints.
- Ensure that the solution can handle n up to 10^5 efficiently.
- For n = 1, the answer is 1 since it's already a power of 2.
- The operations must be minimized, making an efficient approach necessary.

## Code üíª
```cpp

int dp(int n) {
    if(n == 0) return 0;
    // cout << n << " " ;
    int ans = 0;
    if((n & 1) == 0) {
        ans = dp(n >> 1);
    } else {
        if(((n >> 1) & 1)== 1) {
        // if(n == 5) cout << "'" << n<< "'";                
            n += 1;
            // while((n & 1) == 0) n >>= 1;
            ans = 1 + dp(n);
        } else {
            ans = 1 + dp(n >> 1);
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

int minOperations(int n) {
    // aggregate consecutive ones
    // turn off one
    return dp(n);
}
```

This code defines two functions: `dp`, which calculates the minimum number of operations to turn a number to zero using bit manipulation, and `minOperations`, which calls `dp` to calculate the operations for a given number.

{{< dots >}}
### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Declaration**
	```cpp
	int dp(int n) {
	```
	Declares the function `dp`, which takes an integer `n` and recursively calculates the minimum number of operations to reduce it to 0.

2. **Base Case**
	```cpp
	    if(n == 0) return 0;
	```
	Base case: If `n` is 0, return 0 as no operations are needed.

3. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int ans = 0;
	```
	Initialize a variable `ans` to store the result of the recursive operations.

4. **Condition Check**
	```cpp
	    if((n & 1) == 0) {
	```
	Check if the least significant bit of `n` is 0 (i.e., `n` is even).

5. **Recursive Call (Even Case)**
	```cpp
	        ans = dp(n >> 1);
	```
	If `n` is even, recursively call `dp` with `n` right-shifted by 1 bit (equivalent to dividing by 2).

6. **Else Block**
	```cpp
	    } else {
	```
	If `n` is odd, enter the else block.

7. **Condition Check (Odd Case)**
	```cpp
	        if(((n >> 1) & 1) == 1) {
	```
	Check if the second least significant bit of `n` is 1 (i.e., the number is odd and the next bit is also set).

8. **Increment n**
	```cpp
	            n += 1;
	```
	If the next least significant bit is 1, increment `n` by 1 to make it even, which will facilitate further bit manipulation.

9. **Recursive Call (Odd Case)**
	```cpp
	            ans = 1 + dp(n);
	```
	If `n` is odd, increment the operation count by 1 and recursively call `dp` on the modified `n`.

10. **Else Block (Even Case)**
	```cpp
	        } else {
	```
	If the second least significant bit is not set (i.e., `n` is an odd number with the next bit cleared), enter this block.

11. **Recursive Call (Even Case)**
	```cpp
	            ans = 1 + dp(n >> 1);
	```
	If the second least significant bit is 0, right-shift `n` by 1 and recursively calculate the number of operations.

12. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return ans;
	```
	Return the calculated result `ans`.

13. **Function Declaration**
	```cpp
	int minOperations(int n) {
	```
	Defines the `minOperations` function that calculates the minimum number of operations to reduce `n` to 0 by calling `dp`.

14. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return dp(n);
	```
	Call the `dp` function with `n` and return the result.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(log n), where n is the input value, due to the logarithmic nature of powers of 2.
- **Average Case:** O(log n), assuming the recursion depth is bounded by log n.
- **Worst Case:** O(log n), as the problem is based on powers of 2 and can be solved within log n steps.

The time complexity is logarithmic with respect to the input n, as each operation reduces n significantly.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(log n), if using recursion or memoization.
- **Worst Case:** O(log n), due to the depth of recursion or the space needed for dynamic programming.

The space complexity is logarithmic because of the recursive calls or memoization used to store intermediate results.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
