### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to determine whether a number `n` is **strictly palindromic**. A number is said to be strictly palindromic if it is palindromic in **every base** from 2 to `n - 2`. A palindromic number is one that reads the same forwards and backwards. 

For example, in base 2, a number is palindromic if its binary representation is the same when read from left to right as it is when read from right to left. Similarly, in base 3, the number must be palindromic when converted to base 3, and so on, for all bases from 2 to `n - 2`.

### Key Definitions
- **Palindromic Number**: A number whose string representation (in any given base) reads the same forwards and backwards.
- **Strictly Palindromic**: A number `n` is strictly palindromic if its representation in **every** base from 2 to `n-2` is a palindrome.

For example:
- Input: `n = 9`
  - Check if 9 is palindromic in base 2, base 3, and so on, up to base `9 - 2 = 7`.
- Output: Determine whether all these representations are palindromes.

The problem asks us to determine whether there exists any number `n` that can satisfy this condition.

### Approach

At first glance, the problem seems to require checking if a number is palindromic in various bases between 2 and `n - 2`. However, there's a key insight that simplifies the problem significantly. 

For a number to be **strictly palindromic**, it must satisfy the condition in all bases from 2 to `n-2`. Let's examine a few small cases to see if such a number can exist.

1. **Base Representation Insight**:
   - Consider `n = 4`. In base 2, the number `4` is represented as `100`. This is not palindromic, so `4` cannot be strictly palindromic.
   - Similarly, for larger numbers, the number's representation in various bases (from 2 to `n - 2`) becomes increasingly complex and unlikely to be palindromic. For example:
     - In base `n - 2`, the number `n` would be represented as `10` (which is always palindromic), but this doesnâ€™t guarantee that it will be palindromic in smaller bases.

2. **Mathematical Observation**:
   - It turns out that no number `n` greater than 2 can be strictly palindromic. This is because, in the majority of bases between 2 and `n - 2`, the representation of the number cannot consistently form a palindrome. This can be verified through a detailed exploration of various base representations for different values of `n`.
   - Hence, for all numbers `n >= 3`, it is impossible to satisfy the strictly palindromic condition for all bases between 2 and `n - 2`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Function Definition

The function `isStrictlyPalindromic` is defined with the integer `n` as the input. This function will determine whether the number `n` is strictly palindromic or not.

```cpp
bool isStrictlyPalindromic(int n) {
    return false;
}
```

#### Step 2: Return `false` for All Inputs

The function returns `false` unconditionally for all input values of `n`. This is based on the observation that there is no number `n` greater than or equal to 3 that can be strictly palindromic. 

```cpp
return false;
```

This statement directly implements the conclusion derived from the mathematical insight: no number `n >= 3` can satisfy the condition of being strictly palindromic.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this function is **O(1)**. The function simply returns `false` regardless of the value of `n`, so no computation or iteration is performed.

- Since there are no loops or complex operations, the time complexity is constant, i.e., **O(1)**.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also **O(1)**. The function only uses a constant amount of space (no arrays or data structures are allocated), so the space complexity is constant.

- The function uses a fixed amount of memory to execute, resulting in **O(1)** space complexity.

### Conclusion

The problem of determining whether a number `n` is strictly palindromic can be solved trivially by returning `false` for all inputs `n >= 3`. This is due to the observation that no number `n` greater than or equal to 3 can be palindromic in every base from 2 to `n - 2`. 

The solution leverages the mathematical insight that strictly palindromic numbers do not exist for `n >= 3`, which simplifies the problem to a constant-time solution. The time and space complexities of this solution are both **O(1)**, making it an extremely efficient solution.

Key Takeaways:
- The problem asks about a very specific condition that no number can satisfy for `n >= 3`.
- The insight into base representations leads to a simple solution with constant time and space complexity.
