You are given a sorted array `nums` of non-negative integers and an integer `maximumBit`. For each query, you need to find the optimal integer `k` (less than `2^maximumBit`) such that the XOR of all elements in the current `nums` array and `k` is maximized. Remove the last element from `nums` after each query and return an array of results.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** You are given two inputs: a sorted array `nums` of non-negative integers and an integer `maximumBit`.
- **Example:** `nums = [0, 1, 1, 3], maximumBit = 2`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
	- 1 <= maximumBit <= 20
	- 0 <= nums[i] < 2^maximumBit

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return an array where each element is the best `k` for each query. `k` maximizes the XOR result of the array `nums` and `k`.
- **Example:** `[0, 3, 2, 3]`
- **Constraints:**
	- The returned array should contain one result for each query.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** To maximize the XOR of the entire array and `k`, where `k` is less than `2^maximumBit`.

- Iterate through the array and compute the XOR of all elements.
- Determine the best `k` that maximizes the XOR result for each query.
- Update the array after each query by removing the last element.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The input array `nums` is non-empty.
- The value of `maximumBit` is within the specified bounds.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `nums = [0, 1, 1, 3], maximumBit = 2`  \
  **Explanation:** Each query asks to find the optimal value of `k` to maximize the XOR of all elements in the current array with `k`, considering the constraint that `k` must be less than `2^maximumBit`.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
We will compute the XOR of all elements in the array, and for each query, find the optimal `k` that maximizes the result.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- XOR operations are sensitive to bitwise manipulation, and the optimal `k` can be determined by checking the result of XORing all array elements with `k`.
- The main challenge is to efficiently compute the result for each query while modifying the array after each query.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- The array `nums` should not be empty.
- Ensure the algorithm efficiently handles large arrays with up to `10^5` elements.
- Consider cases where all elements in the array are zero or the array has a single element.
- Make sure to handle all constraints such as the sorted nature of the array and the bounds for `maximumBit`.

## Code üíª
```cpp
vector<int> getMaximumXor(vector<int>& nums, int bit) {
    int ui = 0;
    for(int x : nums)
        ui ^= x;
    int msk = (1 << bit) - 1;
    
    
    

    
    int res = ui ^ msk;
    vector<int> ans;
    ans.push_back(res);
    while(nums.size() > 1) {
        
        res ^= nums.back();
        nums.pop_back();
        ans.push_back(res);
        
    }
    return ans;
}
```

This code defines a function `getMaximumXor` that calculates the XOR for a series of numbers, returning the maximum XOR values for each step by iterating through the list of numbers and performing the XOR operation in reverse order.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	vector<int> getMaximumXor(vector<int>& nums, int bit) {
	```
	Defines the function `getMaximumXor`, which takes a vector of integers `nums` and an integer `bit` as input and returns a vector of integers.

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int ui = 0;
	```
	Initializes the variable `ui` to 0, which will be used to store the XOR of all the elements in the `nums` vector.

3. **Loop Through Numbers**
	```cpp
	    for(int x : nums)
	```
	Starts a loop to iterate through each number `x` in the `nums` vector.

4. **XOR Operation**
	```cpp
	        ui ^= x;
	```
	Performs the XOR operation between `ui` and `x`, updating `ui` with the result. This effectively calculates the XOR of all numbers in the vector.

5. **Mask Calculation**
	```cpp
	    int msk = (1 << bit) - 1;
	```
	Calculates a mask `msk` by shifting 1 left by `bit` positions and subtracting 1. This mask is used to keep only the relevant bits.

6. **XOR Masking**
	```cpp
	    int res = ui ^ msk;
	```
	Applies the mask `msk` to `ui` by performing an XOR operation. This gives the final result after masking.

7. **Vector Initialization**
	```cpp
	    vector<int> ans;
	```
	Initializes an empty vector `ans` to store the results of the XOR calculations.

8. **Store Initial Result**
	```cpp
	    ans.push_back(res);
	```
	Adds the initial XOR result `res` to the `ans` vector.

9. **While Loop Start**
	```cpp
	    while(nums.size() > 1) {
	```
	Starts a while loop that continues as long as there is more than one element left in the `nums` vector.

10. **Reverse XOR Operation**
	```cpp
	        res ^= nums.back();
	```
	Performs the XOR operation with the last element in `nums` (using `nums.back()`) and updates `res`.

11. **Remove Last Element**
	```cpp
	        nums.pop_back();
	```
	Removes the last element from the `nums` vector after performing the XOR operation.

12. **Store Updated Result**
	```cpp
	        ans.push_back(res);
	```
	Adds the updated result `res` to the `ans` vector after each XOR operation.

13. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return ans;
	```
	Returns the `ans` vector, which contains the results of the XOR operations.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Average Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

Since we are performing XOR operations and modifying the array after each query, the time complexity for each query is O(n).

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the result array and intermediate computations.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
