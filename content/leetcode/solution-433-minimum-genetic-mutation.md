You are given two gene strings, `startGene` and `endGene`, both consisting of 8 characters. You also have a gene bank of valid gene strings that can be mutated into one another. A mutation is defined as changing one character at a time, and the mutated gene string must exist in the gene bank. Your task is to determine the minimum number of mutations needed to transform `startGene` into `endGene`. If transformation is impossible, return -1.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** You are given three inputs: `startGene` (an 8-character gene string), `endGene` (an 8-character gene string), and a `bank` (a list of valid gene strings).
- **Example:** `startGene = 'AACCGGTT', endGene = 'AACCGGTA', bank = ['AACCGGTA']`
- **Constraints:**
	- 0 <= bank.length <= 10
	- startGene.length == endGene.length == bank[i].length == 8
	- startGene, endGene, and bank[i] consist of only the characters ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T']

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the minimum number of mutations needed to transform `startGene` to `endGene`. If it's not possible, return -1.
- **Example:** `1`
- **Constraints:**
	- If no mutation path exists, return -1.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** The goal is to find the shortest path from `startGene` to `endGene` by performing valid mutations and using the gene bank.

- 1. Check if `endGene` exists in the gene bank. If not, return -1.
- 2. Use a breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all possible gene strings starting from `startGene`.
- 3. For each gene string, generate all possible mutations by changing one character at a time.
- 4. If a mutated gene string exists in the gene bank, add it to the BFS queue.
- 5. Keep track of the number of mutations, and return the result when `endGene` is reached.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The startGene is always valid.
- Mutations are only allowed if the resulting gene string exists in the bank.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `Input: startGene = 'AACCGGTT', endGene = 'AACCGGTA', bank = ['AACCGGTA']`  \
  **Explanation:** We mutate the last character from 'T' to 'A', which results in the endGene after one mutation.

- **Input:** `Input: startGene = 'AACCGGTT', endGene = 'AAACGGTA', bank = ['AACCGGTA','AACCGCTA','AAACGGTA']`  \
  **Explanation:** The solution involves two mutations: first from 'AACCGGTT' to 'AACCGGTA', and then from 'AACCGGTA' to 'AAACGGTA'.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from `startGene` to `endGene` by exploring all possible valid mutations in the gene bank.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- This is a shortest path problem, and BFS is ideal because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving to nodes at the next depth level.
- We need to generate all possible gene strings from the current string by changing one character at a time, and check if the mutated string is in the gene bank.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- If the gene bank is empty, return -1 unless `startGene` is equal to `endGene`.
- Ensure that the BFS approach handles up to 10 valid mutations efficiently.
- If the `startGene` is equal to `endGene`, return 0 because no mutation is needed.
- Handle cases where no valid mutations exist or where the gene bank is empty.

## Code üíª
```cpp
int minMutation(string startGene, string endGene, vector<string>& bank) {
    unordered_set<string> st{bank.begin(), bank.end()};
    if(!st.count(endGene)) return -1;

    queue<string> q;
    q.push(startGene);
    int step = 0, s;
    string cur, t;
    while(!q.empty()) {
        s = q.size();
        while(s--) {
            cur = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if(cur == endGene) return step;
            st.erase(cur);
            for(int i= 0; i < 8; i++) {
                t = cur;
                t[i] = 'A';
                if(st.count(t)) q.push(t);
                t[i] = 'T';
                if(st.count(t)) q.push(t);
                t[i] = 'G';
                if(st.count(t)) q.push(t);
                t[i] = 'C';
                if(st.count(t)) q.push(t);                    
            }
        }
        step++;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Declaration**
	```cpp
	int minMutation(string startGene, string endGene, vector<string>& bank) {
	```

3. **Base Condition**
	```cpp
	    if(!st.count(endGene)) return -1;

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(1), if startGene is equal to endGene.
- **Average Case:** O(N * 8), where N is the number of gene strings in the bank and each mutation takes O(8) time (since the length of each gene string is 8).
- **Worst Case:** O(N * 8), where N is the number of possible gene mutations.

BFS explores each possible mutation in the gene bank.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(1), if no mutations are required.
- **Worst Case:** O(N), where N is the number of gene strings stored in the queue and the bank.

The space complexity depends on the number of nodes in the BFS queue.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
