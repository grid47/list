You are given a circle, and you need to divide it into 'n' equal slices using the minimum number of straight cuts. A valid cut can either be through the center of the circle touching two points on the edge or touching just one point and the center.

### Input Representations 📥
- **Input:** The input is a single integer, n, which represents the number of slices the circle should be divided into.
- **Example:** `n = 6`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= n <= 100

### Output Specifications 📤
- **Output:** Return the minimum number of cuts needed to divide the circle into 'n' equal slices.
- **Example:** `Output: 3`
- **Constraints:**
	- The output should be a single integer representing the minimum cuts needed.

### Core Logic 🔍
**Goal:** The goal is to determine the fewest number of cuts needed to divide a circle into exactly 'n' equal parts using valid cuts.

- If n is 1, no cuts are required.
- For even numbers, cuts can be made in half, and for odd numbers, each cut should be made to increase the number of equal slices incrementally.

### Problem Assumptions ✅
- The circle is perfectly symmetric, and the goal is to divide it into equal slices.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples 🧩
- **Input:** `Example 2: n = 5`  \
  **Explanation:** Since 5 is an odd number, 5 cuts are needed to divide the circle into 5 equal parts, as no other number of cuts can evenly divide it.

## Approach 🚀
The solution involves calculating the minimum number of cuts based on whether the number of slices is odd or even.

### Initial Thoughts 💭
- If n is even, a smaller number of cuts can be used by cutting through the center of the circle symmetrically.
- If n is odd, each cut must be added incrementally to get the required number of slices.
- For even values of n, the answer is n/2. For odd values of n, the answer is simply n.

### Edge Cases 🌐
- n will always be greater than or equal to 1, so no empty inputs are possible.
- The largest value for n is 100, which is manageable in terms of time complexity.
- If n = 1, no cuts are needed.
- Ensure that n always falls within the bounds of 1 to 100.

## Code 💻
```cpp
int numberOfCuts(int n) {
    if (n == 1) return 0;
    return n % 2 ? n : n / 2;
}
```

This function calculates the number of cuts needed to divide a given number of pieces based on the number `n`. If `n` is odd, the result is `n`; if `n` is even, it returns `n / 2`. The case for `n = 1` is handled separately by returning 0, as no cuts are needed.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown 🛠️
1. **Function Declaration**
	```cpp
	int numberOfCuts(int n) {
	```
	This is the declaration of the function `numberOfCuts`, which takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of cuts (an integer) needed to divide `n` into pieces.

2. **Base Case**
	```cpp
	    if (n == 1) return 0;
	```
	Checks if `n` is 1. If it is, no cuts are needed, so the function returns 0.

3. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return n % 2 ? n : n / 2;
	```
	If `n` is odd, the function returns `n` itself (since no further division is possible). If `n` is even, it returns `n / 2`, indicating that the number of cuts required is half of `n`.

## Complexity Analysis 📊
### Time Complexity ⏳
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Average Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

The time complexity is O(1) since we are simply performing a constant-time check on whether n is odd or even.

### Space Complexity 💾
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(1)

The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space for the computation.
