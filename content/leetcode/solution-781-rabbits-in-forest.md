In a forest, there are an unknown number of rabbits. We ask n rabbits, 'How many rabbits of the same color as you are there?' and collect their answers in an integer array answers, where answers[i] is the answer of the i-th rabbit. The task is to determine the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.

### Input Representations 📥
- **Input:** The input consists of an array answers where each element answers[i] represents the number of rabbits that the i-th rabbit believes share the same color.
- **Example:** `Input: answers = [2, 2, 1]`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= answers.length <= 1000
	- 0 <= answers[i] < 1000

### Output Specifications 📤
- **Output:** The output is a single integer representing the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.
- **Example:** `Output: 6`
- **Constraints:**
	- The minimum number of rabbits must satisfy the answers given by the rabbits.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic 🔍
**Goal:** The goal is to calculate the minimum number of rabbits in the forest that could explain the given answers.

- Count the frequency of each answer.
- For each answer, calculate the minimum number of rabbits required to satisfy that answer. If there are X rabbits answering the same number Y, then the minimum number of rabbits for that answer group is ceil(X / (Y+1)) * (Y+1).
- Sum up the required rabbits for all answer groups to find the total minimum.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ✅
- The array of answers is valid, and each answer is a non-negative integer.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples 🧩
- **Input:** `Example 1: Input: answers = [2, 2, 1]`  \
  **Explanation:** The two rabbits that answered '2' need to be in a group of at least 3 rabbits, and the one rabbit that answered '1' needs to be in a group of at least 2 rabbits. Therefore, the minimum number of rabbits in the forest is 6.

- **Input:** `Example 2: Input: answers = [5, 5, 5]`  \
  **Explanation:** The three rabbits that answered '5' need to be in a group of at least 6 rabbits, so the minimum number of rabbits in the forest is 6.

## Approach 🚀
The approach is to count how many rabbits give the same answer, then compute the minimum number of rabbits required to form complete groups that match those answers.

### Initial Thoughts 💭
- The answers represent groups of rabbits with the same color, and the answers must form groups that fit within those constraints.
- To minimize the total number of rabbits, each group should be as small as possible while still matching the answers given by the rabbits.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases 🌐
- The input array will always have at least one element.
- Ensure the solution handles arrays with a length up to 1000.
- When all rabbits answer '0', only one rabbit is needed in the forest.
- The solution should handle all possible values of answers correctly, considering edge cases like answers with high values near 999.

## Code 💻
```cpp
int numRabbits(vector<int>& answers) {
    unordered_map<int, int> c;
    for(int i: answers)
    c[i]++;
    int res = 0;
    for(auto i : c) res += (i.second + i.first) / (i.first + 1) * (i.first + 1);
    return res;
}
```

The function computes the total number of rabbits based on the answers to the question 'How many other rabbits have the same color as you?'.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown 🛠️
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int numRabbits(vector<int>& answers) {
	```
	Defines the function `numRabbits`, which takes a vector of integers `answers` representing the answers to the rabbit color question.

2. **Map Initialization**
	```cpp
	    unordered_map<int, int> c;
	```
	Initializes an unordered map `c` to count the frequency of each answer (representing the number of rabbits with the same color).

3. **Loop Through Answers**
	```cpp
	    for(int i: answers)
	```
	Loops through each element in the `answers` vector to count how many times each answer appears.

4. **Count Answers**
	```cpp
	    c[i]++;
	```
	Increments the count for the current answer `i` in the map `c`.

5. **Result Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int res = 0;
	```
	Initializes a variable `res` to store the final result, which is the total number of rabbits.

6. **Calculate Total Rabbits**
	```cpp
	    for(auto i : c) res += (i.second + i.first) / (i.first + 1) * (i.first + 1);
	```
	Iterates through the map `c` and calculates the total number of rabbits based on the frequency of each answer. The formula ensures that if there are `x` rabbits with the same answer, they will all be grouped together.

7. **Return Result**
	```cpp
	    return res;
	```
	Returns the calculated total number of rabbits.

## Complexity Analysis 📊
### Time Complexity ⏳
- **Best Case:** O(n), where n is the number of rabbits, because we only need to count the frequency of answers.
- **Average Case:** O(n), as the process of counting and grouping is linear with respect to the number of answers.
- **Worst Case:** O(n), as the worst case also involves counting frequencies and calculating the group sizes.

The time complexity is linear in the size of the input array.

### Space Complexity 💾
- **Best Case:** O(n), when all rabbits have unique answers.
- **Worst Case:** O(n), where n is the number of unique answers, since we need to store the frequency of each answer.

Space complexity is linear with respect to the number of unique answers in the input.
