You are given a non-decreasing sorted integer array. Perform operations to remove pairs of elements where nums[i] < nums[j] and return the minimum length of the array after the operations.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input consists of a sorted list of integers.
- **Example:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
	- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
	- nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the minimum length of the array after applying the operations.
- **Example:** `Output: 0`
- **Constraints:**
	- The output is an integer, representing the remaining array length.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** Determine the minimum length of the array after applying zero or more operations to remove pairs.

- Count the frequency of each element in the array.
- Identify the largest frequency of any element.
- Based on the frequency, determine how many elements can be removed.
- Return the minimum remaining length based on the possible operations.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The input array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- Only valid pairs can be removed (i.e., nums[i] < nums[j]).
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`  \
  **Explanation:** All elements can be removed in pairs, leaving the array empty.

- **Input:** `nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`  \
  **Explanation:** All elements can be removed in pairs, leaving the array empty.

- **Input:** `nums = [1000000000, 1000000000]`  \
  **Explanation:** Both elements are equal, so no pairs can be removed, and the array remains with 2 elements.

- **Input:** `nums = [2, 3, 4, 4, 4]`  \
  **Explanation:** One element can be removed (either 2 or 3), leaving one element.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
The approach is to count the frequency of each element and decide how many pairs can be removed based on the largest frequencies.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The problem can be reduced to counting frequencies and checking how many pairs can be removed.
- If no valid pairs exist (i.e., all elements are the same), the answer will be the size of the array.
- The key insight is that elements with the same value cannot form a valid pair. The task is to find how many pairs can be removed by checking frequencies.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- If the input array is empty, the result is 0.
- For large inputs, ensure that counting frequencies and removing elements is efficient.
- If all elements are the same, no pairs can be removed, and the array will remain unchanged.
- The array must contain distinct integers, sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Code üíª
```cpp
int minLengthAfterRemovals(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    for(int i : nums){
        mp[i]++;
    }
    int maxi = 0;
    for(auto it : mp){
        maxi = max(maxi, it.second);
    }
    if(maxi <= n/2){
        if(n%2){
            return 1;
        }
        else{
            return 0;
        }
    }
    return 2*maxi - n;
    
    
}
```

This function calculates the minimum length of a vector after removing elements based on their frequencies. The goal is to ensure that the frequency of the most frequent element does not exceed half the size of the array.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int minLengthAfterRemovals(vector<int>& nums) {
	```
	The function definition starts here. It takes a vector of integers 'nums' and returns the minimum length after removals.

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int n = nums.size();
	```
	Initialize the variable 'n' to the size of the input vector 'nums'.

3. **Map Initialization**
	```cpp
	    unordered_map<int, int> mp;
	```
	Initialize an unordered map 'mp' to store the frequency of each element in the vector.

4. **Loop Start**
	```cpp
	    for(int i : nums){
	```
	Start a loop to iterate through each element 'i' in the vector 'nums'.

5. **Frequency Count**
	```cpp
	        mp[i]++;
	```
	Increment the count for the current element 'i' in the map 'mp'.

6. **Max Frequency Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int maxi = 0;
	```
	Initialize 'maxi' to store the maximum frequency found in the map.

7. **Frequency Loop**
	```cpp
	    for(auto it : mp){
	```
	Start a loop to iterate through each element in the frequency map 'mp'.

8. **Update Maximum Frequency**
	```cpp
	        maxi = max(maxi, it.second);
	```
	Update the 'maxi' variable with the maximum frequency found in the map.

9. **Condition Check**
	```cpp
	    if(maxi <= n/2){
	```
	Check if the maximum frequency is less than or equal to half the size of the vector.

10. **Odd Size Check**
	```cpp
	        if(n%2){
	```
	If the size of the vector 'n' is odd, return 1.

11. **Return 1**
	```cpp
	            return 1;
	```
	Return 1 if the array size is odd and the maximum frequency is less than or equal to half the size.

12. **Even Size Check**
	```cpp
	        else{
	```
	If the size of the vector 'n' is even, return 0.

13. **Return 0**
	```cpp
	            return 0;
	```
	Return 0 if the array size is even and the maximum frequency is less than or equal to half the size.

14. **Return Calculation**
	```cpp
	    return 2*maxi - n;
	```
	Return the result of '2*maxi - n', which is the minimum length after removals.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Average Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once to count frequencies and check the conditions.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The space complexity is O(n) due to the frequency count stored in a hash map.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
