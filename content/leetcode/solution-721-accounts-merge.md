You are given a list of accounts, where each account consists of a name and a list of emails. Merge accounts that share common emails, and return the merged accounts in the format: name followed by sorted emails.

{{< dots >}}
### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** Each account is represented by a list of strings. The first element is the name, and the rest are email addresses.
- **Example:** `accounts = [["Alice","alice@mail.com","alice_newyork@mail.com"], ["Alice","alice@mail.com","alice123@mail.com"], ["Bob","bob@mail.com"]]`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= accounts.length <= 1000
	- 2 <= accounts[i].length <= 10
	- 1 <= accounts[i][j].length <= 30
	- accounts[i][0] consists of English letters.
	- accounts[i][j] (for j > 0) is a valid email.

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the merged accounts, where each account starts with the name followed by a sorted list of email addresses.
- **Example:** `[["Alice","alice123@mail.com","alice@mail.com","alice_newyork@mail.com"]]`
- **Constraints:**
	- The accounts should be returned with emails in sorted order and merged by shared emails.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** The goal is to merge accounts based on common emails.

- Use a graph where each email is a node, and there is an edge between two emails if they belong to the same account.
- For each account, build the graph by connecting emails together.
- Perform DFS (depth-first search) to find all connected emails for each component, representing one account.
- Sort the emails in lexicographical order and return the merged result with the name and emails.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- Each account contains at least one email.
- The same person may have multiple accounts with the same or different names.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `accounts = [["Alice","alice@mail.com","alice_newyork@mail.com"], ["Alice","alice@mail.com","alice123@mail.com"], ["Bob","bob@mail.com"]]`  \
  **Explanation:** The first and second Alice accounts are merged since they share the email 'alice@mail.com'. The result should contain Alice‚Äôs emails sorted, and Bob‚Äôs account should remain unchanged.

- **Input:** `accounts = [["John","john1@mail.com","john2@mail.com","john3@mail.com"], ["Mike","mike1@mail.com","mike2@mail.com"], ["John","john1@mail.com","john4@mail.com"]]`  \
  **Explanation:** Both John accounts share 'john1@mail.com', so they are merged, with all of John‚Äôs emails sorted.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
The solution uses a graph-based approach to merge accounts that share common emails.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- Each email can be treated as a node, and accounts with common emails form connected components in the graph.
- By performing DFS on the graph, we can find all connected emails for each account and merge them.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- If the input list is empty, return an empty list.
- The solution must handle up to 1000 accounts efficiently.
- If no accounts share any emails, each account should be returned individually.
- The solution should work within time and space limits for the maximum input size.

## Code üíª
```cpp
vector<vector<string>> accountsMerge(vector<vector<string>>& acc) {
    map<string, string> mp;
    map<string, set<string>> gph;
    for(auto ac: acc) {
        for(int i = 1; i < ac.size(); i++) {
            mp[ac[i]] = ac[0];
            gph[ac[i]].insert(ac[1]);
            gph[ac[1]].insert(ac[i]);
        }
    }
    
    set<string> seen;
    vector<vector<string>> ans;
    for(auto it: mp) {
        if(seen.count(it.first)) continue;
        vector<string> tmp;
        dfs(tmp, gph, seen, it.first);
        sort(tmp.begin(), tmp.end());
        tmp.insert(tmp.begin(), it.second);
        ans.push_back(tmp);
    }
    
    return ans;
}

void dfs(vector<string> &tmp, map<string, set<string>> &gph, set<string> &seen, string node) {
    tmp.push_back(node);
    seen.insert(node);
    for(auto it: gph[node]) {
        if(!seen.count(it)) {
            dfs(tmp, gph, seen, it);
        }
    }
    
}
```

This function merges email accounts by identifying connected components in a graph where each email represents a node and edges exist between emails belonging to the same account.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Graph Initialization**
	```cpp
	vector<vector<string>> accountsMerge(vector<vector<string>>& acc) {
	```
	The main function starts by initializing the structure to merge accounts.

2. **Data Mapping**
	```cpp
	    map<string, string> mp;
	```
	A mapping of emails to account names.

3. **Graph Construction**
	```cpp
	    map<string, set<string>> gph;
	```
	Graph representation where each email is a node connected to other emails.

	```
	Recursively calls DFS for unvisited neighbors.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n log n), where n is the number of emails, because sorting the emails is the most time-consuming operation.
- **Average Case:** O(n + e), where n is the number of emails and e is the number of edges in the graph (connections between emails).
- **Worst Case:** O(n log n + e), where n is the number of emails and e is the number of edges.

The time complexity is dominated by DFS and sorting the emails in each connected component.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(n), in the case where no emails are shared between accounts.
- **Worst Case:** O(n + e), where n is the number of emails and e is the number of edges.

The space complexity is dominated by the graph representation and storage for the emails.
