You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length. You need to check if some permutation of `s1` can 'break' some permutation of `s2`, or vice-versa. A string `x` can break string `y` if for every character at position `i`, `x[i] >= y[i]` when sorted alphabetically.

### Input Representations 📥
- **Input:** The input consists of two strings `s1` and `s2`, both containing only lowercase English letters.
- **Example:** `s1 = 'cat', s2 = 'abc'`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= s1.length == s2.length <= 10^5
	- All strings consist of lowercase English letters.

### Output Specifications 📤
- **Output:** The output is a boolean indicating whether one permutation of `s1` can break some permutation of `s2`, or vice-versa.
- **Example:** `true`
- **Constraints:**
	- The output is 'true' if one permutation can break the other, otherwise 'false'.

### Core Logic 🔍
**Goal:** To determine if one permutation of `s1` can break some permutation of `s2` or vice-versa.

- Step 1: Sort both strings `s1` and `s2`.
- Step 2: Compare the characters of the sorted strings. If at any position, a character from `s1` is less than the corresponding character from `s2`, return 'false'.
- Step 3: If no such position is found, return 'true'.

### Problem Assumptions ✅
- Both input strings are valid and consist of lowercase English letters.
- The strings are of equal length.

## Examples 🧩
- **Input:** `s1 = 'cat', s2 = 'abc'`  \
  **Explanation:** After sorting both strings, we have 'act' and 'abc'. Since each character in 'act' is greater than or equal to the corresponding character in 'abc', 's1' can break 's2'.

- **Input:** `s1 = 'dog', s2 = 'god'`  \
  **Explanation:** After sorting both strings, we have 'dgo' and 'dgo'. Since the strings are identical, neither can break the other.

## Approach 🚀
We will compare the sorted versions of both strings to determine if one string can break the other. Sorting ensures that we are comparing the lexicographically ordered characters.

### Initial Thoughts 💭
- Sorting the strings ensures that we can directly compare their characters in lexicographical order.
- By comparing sorted strings character by character, we can determine if one can break the other.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases 🌐
- There are no empty inputs as the problem guarantees non-empty strings.
- Ensure the solution handles strings up to the length of 10^5 efficiently.
- Consider cases where the strings are identical (e.g., 'abc' and 'abc').
- The solution should be efficient enough to handle strings of length up to 10^5.

## Code 💻
```cpp
bool checkIfCanBreak(string s1, string s2) {
    sort(s1.begin(), s1.end());
    sort(s2.begin(), s2.end());
    int n = s1.size();
    string a = s1 < s2 ? s2: s1;
    string b = s1 < s2 ? s1: s2;   
    // cout << a << "\n"<< b;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(a[i] < b[i]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

The `checkIfCanBreak` function checks if one string can break another string based on lexicographical order after sorting. The function returns `true` if every character in the sorted version of one string is greater than or equal to the corresponding character in the sorted version of the other string.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown 🛠️
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	bool checkIfCanBreak(string s1, string s2) {
	```
	Defines the function `checkIfCanBreak`, which takes two strings `s1` and `s2` as input and determines whether one can break the other.

2. **Sorting**
	```cpp
	    sort(s1.begin(), s1.end());
	```
	Sorts the string `s1` in lexicographical order.

3. **Sorting**
	```cpp
	    sort(s2.begin(), s2.end());
	```
	Sorts the string `s2` in lexicographical order.

4. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int n = s1.size();
	```
	Stores the size of string `s1` in the variable `n`. Both strings are assumed to have the same length.

5. **String Comparison**
	```cpp
	    string a = s1 < s2 ? s2: s1;
	```
	Assigns `a` to be the lexicographically larger of `s1` and `s2`.

6. **String Comparison**
	```cpp
	    string b = s1 < s2 ? s1: s2;   
	```
	Assigns `b` to be the lexicographically smaller of `s1` and `s2`.

7. **Loop**
	```cpp
	    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	```
	Begins a loop that iterates over each character of the strings `a` and `b`.

8. **Conditional Check**
	```cpp
	        if(a[i] < b[i]) return false;
	```
	Compares the characters at the same position in `a` and `b`. If any character in `a` is less than the corresponding character in `b`, returns `false`.

9. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return true;
	```
	If the loop completes without returning `false`, it means that every character in `a` is greater than or equal to the corresponding character in `b`, so it returns `true`.

## Complexity Analysis 📊
### Time Complexity ⏳
- **Best Case:** O(n log n) for sorting the strings.
- **Average Case:** O(n log n) for sorting and O(n) for the comparison.
- **Worst Case:** O(n log n) due to the sorting step.

The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step.

### Space Complexity 💾
- **Best Case:** O(n), as we need to store the sorted versions of the strings.
- **Worst Case:** O(n) for storing the sorted strings.

The space complexity is linear, as we are storing the sorted versions of both strings.

**Happy Coding! 🎉**
