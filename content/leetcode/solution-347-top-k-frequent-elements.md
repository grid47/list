### üöÄ Problem Statement

In this problem, you're asked to return the **k most frequent elements** from a list of integers. Given an array of integers, your task is to identify and return the elements that appear most frequently. The order of the elements doesn't matter ‚Äî just make sure to return the top **k** elements with the highest frequency!

Can you think of an efficient way to find the **top k frequent elements** without running into performance issues? Let‚Äôs break it down!

### üß† Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a combination of a **frequency map** and a **priority queue** (or **max heap**) to help us retrieve the top k frequent elements. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Count the Frequencies**: Start by counting how many times each element appears in the array.
2. **Use a Priority Queue**: Push the frequency-element pairs into a priority queue. This will allow us to quickly access the elements with the highest frequencies.
3. **Extract the Top k Elements**: Once the elements are sorted by frequency, we can pop the top k elements from the queue.

This approach ensures that we can efficiently retrieve the most frequent elements with minimal complexity. üí™

### üî® Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Let‚Äôs go over the code to see how each part works!

#### Step 1: Count the Frequency of Elements
```cpp
map<int, int> ma;
for(int x: nums)
    ma[x]++;
```
- We start by using a `map<int, int>` to count the frequency of each element in the array `nums`. The key is the element, and the value is its frequency.
- The loop iterates through `nums` and increments the count of each element in the map.

#### Step 2: Push the Frequency-Pair into a Priority Queue
```cpp
priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq;

for(auto [key, val]: ma)
    pq.push(make_pair(val, key));
```
- Next, we create a **priority queue** called `pq` to store the pairs of (frequency, element). 
- The priority queue sorts the pairs in descending order based on frequency, meaning that the element with the highest frequency will always be at the top.
- We iterate through the `map` and push each `(frequency, element)` pair into the queue.

#### Step 3: Extract the Top k Frequent Elements
```cpp
vector<int> ans;
while(k--) {
    ans.push_back(pq.top().second);
    pq.pop();
}
```
- Now, we initialize a `vector<int>` called `ans` to store the final result.
- The `while` loop runs `k` times, each time extracting the top element from the priority queue. We push the **element** (not the frequency) from the pair into `ans`.
- After each extraction, we remove the top element from the queue using `pq.pop()`.

#### Step 4: Return the Result
```cpp
return ans;
```
- Finally, we return the `ans` vector, which contains the top k frequent elements.

### üìà Complexity Analysis

Let‚Äôs analyze the time and space complexity to ensure our solution is optimal.

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n log n)**: Here‚Äôs the breakdown:
  1. **Counting the frequencies**: We iterate over the array once, so this step takes **O(n)**.
  2. **Inserting into the priority queue**: We insert each element into the queue. Each insertion takes **O(log m)**, where `m` is the number of unique elements in the map. In the worst case, `m` is equal to `n`, so the complexity for this step is **O(n log n)**.
  3. **Extracting the top k elements**: Extracting `k` elements from the queue takes **O(k log n)** time. Since `k` is often much smaller than `n`, this step is dominated by the previous steps.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We use a map to store the frequencies of the elements, and the priority queue holds up to `n` pairs in the worst case. So, the space complexity is proportional to the size of the input array.

### üèÅ Conclusion

We‚Äôve successfully solved the problem of finding the **k most frequent elements** in an array with an optimal approach using a frequency map and a priority queue. üéâ

#### Recap:
- **Time Complexity**: **O(n log n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements.
- The solution efficiently handles large arrays and varying frequencies of elements.
- By using a priority queue, we can quickly retrieve the **top k frequent elements**.

This approach is easy to understand, efficient, and works well for this type of problem. Keep practicing to sharpen your skills in working with heaps and frequency counting ‚Äî they are powerful tools in algorithm design! üåü
