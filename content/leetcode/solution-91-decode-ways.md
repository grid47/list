### üîê **Decode Ways** ‚Äì Unravel the Mystery of Decoding!

The **Decode Ways** problem is a fascinating challenge, where you‚Äôre tasked with decoding a string of digits into alphabetic characters. Each digit or pair of digits represents a letter in the alphabet ('A' = 1, 'B' = 2, ..., 'Z' = 26). Your goal is to determine the number of distinct ways the string can be decoded.

#### Example Walkthrough:
- **Input**: `"12"`  
  - Decodings: "AB" (1 ‚Üí A, 2 ‚Üí B) or "L" (12 ‚Üí L)  
  - **Output**: `2`
  
- **Input**: `"226"`  
  - Decodings: "BBF", "BZ", "VF"  
  - **Output**: `3`

We also need to handle edge cases like leading zeros or numbers greater than 26, which represent invalid decodings.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Approach**

The problem is solved efficiently using **dynamic programming (DP)** with **memoization**. The idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems, storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Base Case**:  
   If we reach the end of the string, we return 1 because it means the string is fully decoded.

2. **Invalid Cases**:  
   If the current digit is '0', it‚Äôs an invalid character (since no letter corresponds to '0'). We return 0 for this case.

3. **Memoization**:  
   We use a `memo` array to store the results of subproblems. This ensures that we don‚Äôt recompute the number of decodings for the same index multiple times.

4. **Recursive Case**:  
   - Recursively calculate the number of ways to decode starting from the next index (`i + 1`).
   - If the current and next characters form a valid two-digit number (between 10 and 26), recursively calculate the number of ways to decode starting from `i + 2`.

### üìú **Code Breakdown**

#### Step 1: Memoization Setup

```cpp
vector<int> memo;
```

- We declare a vector `memo` that will store the number of decodings for each index in the string. Initially, it is empty and will be resized according to the size of the input string `s`.

#### Step 2: Main Function to Call the Helper

```cpp
int numDecodings(string s) {
    memo.resize(s.size(), -1); // Initialize memoization array
    return !s.size()? 0 : ways(0, s);
}
```

- The `memo` array is resized to match the length of the input string `s`, with all elements initialized to `-1` (indicating that no subproblem has been solved yet).
- The function checks if the string is empty. If so, it returns 0 because an empty string cannot be decoded.

#### Step 3: Helper Function for Recursion

```cpp
int ways(int i, string s) {
    if(i == s.size()) return 1;  // Base case: reached the end of the string
    if(s[i] == '0') return 0;    // Invalid character ('0' cannot be decoded)
    if(memo[i] > -1) return memo[i];  // Return memoized result if already computed

    int res = ways(i + 1, s);  // Decode the current character as a single digit

    // If current and next character together form a valid two-digit number (10-26)
    if(i < s.size() - 1 && (s[i] == '1' || (s[i] == '2' && s[i + 1] < '7'))) {
        res += ways(i + 2, s);  // Decode the pair of digits as a two-digit number
    }

    return memo[i] = res;  // Store the result in the memoization array
}
```

- **Base Case 1**: If `i` reaches the end of the string (`i == s.size()`), return 1 because we've successfully decoded the entire string.
- **Base Case 2**: If the current character is `'0'`, return 0 since it cannot be decoded into any letter.
- **Memoization Check**: If the result for the current index `i` is already calculated (`memo[i] > -1`), simply return the stored value.
- We recursively calculate the number of decodings starting from index `i + 1` (for single-digit decoding).
- If the current and next character together form a valid two-digit number between 10 and 26, we also calculate the number of decodings starting from `i + 2` (for two-digit decoding).

#### Step 4: Return the Result

The result is stored in the `memo` array and returned to avoid redundant calculations.

### üìà **Time and Space Complexity**

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because each index is processed only once due to memoization.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(n)** because we use a memoization array of size `n` and recursion depth can also reach `n` in the worst case.

### üèÅ **Conclusion**

The **dynamic programming** approach with **memoization** efficiently counts the number of decodings of a string. By breaking the problem into subproblems and reusing previously computed results, the algorithm achieves a time complexity of **O(n)**. This approach ensures that we avoid redundant calculations and scale well for large inputs.

This solution is **optimal** for this problem, making it perfect for scenarios where you need to decode strings of significant length efficiently.

### üåü **Final Thoughts**

This problem is a great example of how **dynamic programming** and **memoization** can transform a seemingly complex recursive problem into an efficient one. Understanding this technique will help you tackle many similar challenges in coding interviews and competitive programming.

Keep practicing and decoding more problems! üöÄ Happy coding! ‚ú®
