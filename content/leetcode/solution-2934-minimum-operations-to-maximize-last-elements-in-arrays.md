You are given two integer arrays, nums1 and nums2, both having length n. You are allowed to perform a series of operations (possibly none). In each operation, you can select an index i in the range [0, n-1] and swap the values of nums1[i] and nums2[i]. The goal is to satisfy two conditions: the last element of nums1 is equal to the maximum value in nums1, and the last element of nums2 is equal to the maximum value in nums2. Return the minimum number of operations required, or -1 if it's impossible to satisfy both conditions.

### Input Representations üì•
- **Input:** The input consists of two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, both having length n.
- **Example:** `nums1 = [4, 2, 5], nums2 = [1, 3, 6]`
- **Constraints:**
	- 1 <= n == nums1.length == nums2.length <= 1000
	- 1 <= nums1[i] <= 10^9
	- 1 <= nums2[i] <= 10^9

{{< dots >}}
### Output Specifications üì§
- **Output:** Return the minimum number of operations needed to meet both conditions or -1 if it is impossible.
- **Example:** `1`
- **Constraints:**
	- If it's impossible, return -1.

{{< dots >}}
### Core Logic üîç
**Goal:** To determine the minimum number of swaps required to satisfy both conditions, or return -1 if it's not possible.

- Iterate over the elements of nums1 and nums2 while checking the possible swaps.
- Check the max elements of both arrays and adjust their last positions.
- If no valid swap is found, return -1, else return the minimum number of swaps needed.
{{< dots >}}
### Problem Assumptions ‚úÖ
- The arrays nums1 and nums2 are of equal length.
- The arrays contain positive integers.
{{< dots >}}
## Examples üß©
- **Input:** `nums1 = [4, 2, 5], nums2 = [1, 3, 6]`  \
  **Explanation:** In this example, a single swap can make both arrays satisfy the condition.

- **Input:** `nums1 = [7, 3, 5, 1], nums2 = [9, 2, 4, 6]`  \
  **Explanation:** Two swaps are required to meet the conditions for both arrays.

- **Input:** `nums1 = [4, 2, 5], nums2 = [1, 3, 6]`  \
  **Explanation:** It's impossible to meet the conditions because one of the arrays is already invalid.

{{< dots >}}
## Approach üöÄ
To solve the problem, we need to iterate through both arrays and keep track of the swaps that would result in both conditions being satisfied.

### Initial Thoughts üí≠
- The maximum elements of both arrays must be placed in the last index of their respective arrays.
- Each swap must either help move the maximum element of nums1 or nums2 to the right place.
- This problem requires comparing the max elements of both arrays and identifying when a swap would be beneficial.
{{< dots >}}
### Edge Cases üåê
- An empty input is not possible due to the constraint n >= 1.
- When handling large arrays, ensure that the algorithm operates within time limits.
- If arrays have all identical values, no swaps are needed.
- Ensure that the solution works for both arrays containing large integers up to 10^9.

## Code üíª
```cpp
int minOperations(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
    int dp1 = 0, dp2 = 0, n = A.size(), mi = min(A[n - 1], B[n - 1]), ma = max(A[n - 1], B[n - 1]);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int a = A[i], b = B[i];
        if (max(a, b) > ma) return -1;
        if (min(a, b) > mi) return -1;
        if (a > A[n - 1] || b > B[n - 1]) dp1++;
        if (a > B[n - 1] || b > A[n - 1]) dp2++;
    }
    return min(dp1, dp2);
}
```

The function calculates the minimum number of operations required to make two arrays, A and B, consistent with specific constraints. It compares values in each array and counts how many operations are needed to align them under the given rules.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Function Definition**
	```cpp
	int minOperations(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
	```
	Defines the main function 'minOperations', which takes two integer vectors, A and B, and returns an integer representing the minimum number of operations required.

2. **Variable Initialization**
	```cpp
	    int dp1 = 0, dp2 = 0, n = A.size(), mi = min(A[n - 1], B[n - 1]), ma = max(A[n - 1], B[n - 1]);
	```
	Initializes the variables: dp1 and dp2 to count operations, n for the size of arrays, mi for the minimum value between the last elements of A and B, and ma for the maximum value.

3. **Loop Setup**
	```cpp
	    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	```
	Sets up a loop to iterate through each element of the arrays A and B.

4. **Element Assignment**
	```cpp
	        int a = A[i], b = B[i];
	```
	Assigns the current elements of arrays A and B to variables a and b respectively.

5. **Check for Maximum Constraint**
	```cpp
	        if (max(a, b) > ma) return -1;
	```
	Checks if the maximum of a and b exceeds the maximum allowed value ma, returning -1 if the condition is met.

6. **Check for Minimum Constraint**
	```cpp
	        if (min(a, b) > mi) return -1;
	```
	Checks if the minimum of a and b exceeds the minimum allowed value mi, returning -1 if the condition is met.

7. **Increment dp1**
	```cpp
	        if (a > A[n - 1] || b > B[n - 1]) dp1++;
	```
	Increments dp1 if either a is greater than the last element of A or b is greater than the last element of B.

8. **Increment dp2**
	```cpp
	        if (a > B[n - 1] || b > A[n - 1]) dp2++;
	```
	Increments dp2 if either a is greater than the last element of B or b is greater than the last element of A.

9. **Return Statement**
	```cpp
	    return min(dp1, dp2);
	```
	Returns the minimum of dp1 and dp2, representing the minimal operations needed.

## Complexity Analysis üìä
### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Average Case:** O(n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The time complexity is linear in relation to the size of the input arrays.

### Space Complexity üíæ
- **Best Case:** O(1)
- **Worst Case:** O(n)

The space complexity is O(n) due to the need to store temporary results.

**Happy Coding! üéâ**
