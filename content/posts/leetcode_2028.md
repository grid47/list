class Solution {
public:
    vector<map<int, bool>> memo;
    vector<int> missingRolls(vector<int>& rolls, int mean, int n) {

        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            sum += rolls[i];
        
        int net = mean * (m + n);
        
        sum = net - sum;
        
        // create an array of size n with sum = sum and elements 1 - 6
        
        if(sum < n || sum > 6 * n) return vector<int>{};

        int x = sum / n, rem = sum % n;
        vector<int> res(n, x);
