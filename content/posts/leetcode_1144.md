public:
    int movesToMakeZigzag(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size(), left, right;
        vector<int> res(2, 0);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            left  = ( i     > 0 ) ? nums[i - 1] : 1001;
            right = ( i + 1 < n ) ? nums[i + 1] : 1001;

            res[i % 2] += max(0, nums[i] - min(left, right) + 1);
