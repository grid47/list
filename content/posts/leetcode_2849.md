**Code:**

{{< highlight cpp >}}
class Solution {
public:
    bool isReachableAtTime(int sx, int sy, int fx, int fy, int t) {

        int mn = min(abs(fy - sy), abs(fx - sx));
        int asdf = (abs(fy - sy) - mn)+ (abs(fx - sx) - mn) + mn;
        if(abs(fy - sy) == 0 && abs(fx - sx) == 0 && t == 1) return false;
        return asdf <= t;

    }
