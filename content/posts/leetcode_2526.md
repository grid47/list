**Code:**

{{< highlight cpp >}}
class DataStream {
public:
    int val, k, cnt = 0;
    DataStream(int value, int k) {
        val = value;
        this->k = k;
    }
    
    bool consec(int num) {
        if(val == num) cnt = min(k, cnt+1);
        else {
            cnt = 0;
        }
        return k == cnt;
    }
};

/**
 * Your DataStream object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * DataStream* obj = new DataStream(value, k);
 * bool param_1 = obj->consec(num);
