**Code:**

{{< highlight cpp >}}

class Solution {
public:
    int findKOr(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int ans = 0; // Initialize the answer to 0.
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 31; i++) {
            // Bit position represented by 2^i.
            int rep = (1 << i); 
            int cnt = 0; // Initialize a counter to count set bits at this position.

            // Iterate through the input vector 'nums'.
            for (auto ele : nums) {
                if (rep & ele) {
                    // If the i-th bit is set in 'ele', increment the count.
                    cnt++;
                }
            }

            // If the count of set bits at this position is greater than or equal to 'k', set the corresponding bit in the answer.
            if (cnt >= k) {
                ans = ans | rep;
            }
        }

        return ans; // Return the final answer, which is the result of the OR operation on selected bits.
    }
