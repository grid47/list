**Code:**

class Solution {
    vector<int> wc;
    public:
    Solution(vector<int>& w) {
        int n = w.size();
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
            w[i] += w[i - 1];
        wc = w;
    }
    
    int pickIndex() {
        
        int x = rand() % wc.back()+1;//[(wc.size() - 1)];        
        int l = 0, r = wc.size() - 1;
    
        while(l < r) {

            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;            
            if(wc[mid] == x) return mid;

            if(wc[mid] < x) l = mid + 1;
            else            r = mid;
        
        }
