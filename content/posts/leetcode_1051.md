public:
    int heightChecker(vector<int>& h) {

        auto m = max_element(h.begin(), h.end());

        vector<int> exp(*m + 1);

        for (int height : h) exp[height]++;

        int res = 0;

        for (int j = 1, i = 0; j < exp.size(); j++)
            while (exp[j]--) res += (h[i++] != j);

        return res;
