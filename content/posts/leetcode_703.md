**Code:**

{{< highlight cpp >}}

public:
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
    int k;
    KthLargest(int k, vector<int>& nums) {

        for(auto x: nums) {
            pq.push(x);
            if(pq.size() > k) {
                cout << pq.top();
                pq.pop();
            }

        }

    }
    
    int add(int val) {
        pq.push(val);

            pq.pop();
        }
