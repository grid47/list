class StockSpanner {
    stack<pair<int, int>> cp;
public:
    StockSpanner() {
        
    }
    
    int next(int price) {
        
        int res = 1;
        
        while(!cp.empty() && cp.top().first <= price) {
            res += cp.top().second;
            cp.pop();
        }
        
        cp.push(make_pair(price, res));
        
        return res;
    }
