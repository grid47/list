**Code:**

{{< highlight cpp >}}
class MedianFinder {
public:
    priority_queue<long> sm;
    priority_queue<long, vector<long>, greater<long>> lg;
    MedianFinder() {
        
    }
    
    void addNum(int num) {
        sm.push((long) num);
        lg.push((long) sm.top());
        sm.pop();
        if(sm.size() < lg.size()) {
            // cout << lg.top();
            sm.push(lg.top());
            lg.pop();
        }
    }
    
    double findMedian() {       
        return lg.size() < sm.size()? sm.top(): (double)(lg.top() + sm.top()) / 2;
    }
};

/**
 * Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:
