**Code:**

{{< highlight cpp >}}

    int cnt[1001][1001] = {};
    vector<pair<int, int>> pts;
public:
    DetectSquares() {
       // cnt.resize(10001, vector<int>(10001));
    }
    
    void add(vector<int> point) {
        cnt[point[0]][point[1]]++;
        pts.emplace_back(point[0], point[1]);
    }

            if(abs(x3 - x1) == 0 || abs(x1 - x3) != abs(y1 - y3))
                continue;
            ans += cnt[x1][y3] * cnt[x3][y1];
