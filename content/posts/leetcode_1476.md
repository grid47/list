public:
    vector<vector<int>> rec;
    SubrectangleQueries(vector<vector<int>>& rectangle) {
        rec = rectangle;
    }
    
    void updateSubrectangle(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2, int newValue) {
        for(int i = row1; i <= row2; i++)
        for(int j = col1; j <= col2; j++)
            rec[i][j] = newValue;
    }
    
    int getValue(int row, int col) {
        return rec[row][col];
    }
};

/**
 * Your SubrectangleQueries object will be instantiated and called as such:

 * obj->updateSubrectangle(row1,col1,row2,col2,newValue);
