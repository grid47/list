**Code:**

{{< highlight cpp >}}
class Solution {
public:

    int getMaximumConsecutive(vector<int>& coins) {
        sort(coins.begin(), coins.end());

        int res = 1;
        for(int a: coins) {
            if(a > res) break;
            // with all the coins I have I can 
            // create upto res - 1,
            // with this a, I can make upto res + a - 1
            // so next target is res += a
            res += a;
        }

        return res;
    }
