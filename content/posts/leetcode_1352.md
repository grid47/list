**Code:**

{{< highlight cpp >}}
class ProductOfNumbers {
    vector<long long> p;
public:
    ProductOfNumbers() {
        p = {1};
    }
    
    void add(int num) {
        if(num > 0) {
            p.push_back(p.back() * num);
        } else {
            p = {1};            
        }

    }
    
    int getProduct(int k) {
        int n = p.size();
        return k < n ? p[n - 1] / p[n - k - 1]: 0;
    }
};

/**
 * Your ProductOfNumbers object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * ProductOfNumbers* obj = new ProductOfNumbers();
