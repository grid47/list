public:
    int minDifference(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        /* change one element to any other value in one move */
        /* get min diff between max and min value after performing atmost 3 moves */
        if(n < 5) return 0;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        return min({nums[n - 1] - nums[3], nums[n - 2] - nums[2], nums[n - 3] - nums[1], nums[n - 4] - nums[0]});
