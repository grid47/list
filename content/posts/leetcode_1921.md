**Code:**

{{< highlight cpp >}}
class Solution {
public:
    int eliminateMaximum(vector<int>& dist, vector<int>& speed) {

        int n = dist.size();
        vector<double> res(n, 0);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        res[i] = (double(dist[i]) / speed[i]);

        sort(res.begin(), res.end());

        long j = 0, ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
