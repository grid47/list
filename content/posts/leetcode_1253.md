**Code:**

{{< highlight cpp >}}
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> reconstructMatrix(int u, int l, vector<int>& cs) {
        vector<vector<int>> res(2, vector<int>(cs.size()));

            res[0][i] = cs[i] == 2 || (cs[i] == 1 && l < u);
            res[1][i] = cs[i] == 2 || (cs[i] == 1 && !res[0][i]);
