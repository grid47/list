**Code:**

{{< highlight cpp >}}
class Solution {
public:
    int minSetSize(vector<int>& arr) {
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        for(int c: arr) ++mp[c];

        vector<int> frq;
        for(auto [_, fq] : mp) frq.push_back(fq);

        sort(frq.begin(), frq.end());

        int ans = 0, i = frq.size() - 1, half = arr.size()/2, rm = 0;
        while(rm < half) {
            rm += frq[i--];
            ans++;
        }
        return ans;
