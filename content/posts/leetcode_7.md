class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x)
    {
        int rev=0, pop;
        while(x != 0)
        {
            pop  = x % 10;
            x   /= 10;

            if( (rev > INT_MAX/10 || (rev == INT_MAX/10 && pop > 7)) || 
                (rev < INT_MIN/10 || (rev == INT_MIN/10 && pop < -8)) )
                return 0;

            rev  = rev * 10 + pop;
        }
