class Solution {
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> mp;
public:
    Solution(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        mp[nums[i]].push_back(i);
    }
    
    int pick(int target) { 
        int sz = mp[target].size();
        int res = mp[target][rand()%sz];
        return res;
    }
};

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution* obj = new Solution(nums);
