        int m = mat.size(), n = mat[0].size();

            for(int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                sum[i][j] = sum[i - 1][j] + sum[i][j - 1] - sum[i - 1][j - 1] + mat[i - 1][j - 1];
                if(i >= len && j >= len && sum[i][j] - sum[i - len][j] - sum[i][j - len] + sum[i - len][j - len] <= hit)
