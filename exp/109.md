### Problem Statement
Convert a sorted singly linked list into a height-balanced binary search tree (BST).

### Approach
1. Use a two-pointer technique (slow and fast pointers) to find the middle element of the linked list, which will serve as the root of the BST.
2. The left half of the list (before the middle) will form the left subtree, and the right half (after the middle) will form the right subtree.
3. Recursively apply this process to form the BST:
   - Set the middle node as the current root.
   - Recursively create left and right children using the list segments before and after the middle.

### Code Walk-through
- **`toBST` function**:
  - **Lines 5-6**: Base case – if `start` equals `end`, return `NULL`.
  - **Lines 8-11**: Use slow (`slw`) and fast (`fst`) pointers to find the middle of the list, with `slw` ending at the midpoint.
  - **Line 13**: Create a `TreeNode` with the middle node’s value.
  - **Lines 14-15**: Recursively set the left and right children using segments to the left and right of `slw`.
  - **Line 16**: Return the root node.
- **`sortedListToBST` function**:
  - **Lines 19-21**: Base case – if the list is empty, return `NULL`. Otherwise, call `toBST` with the full list.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes. Each node requires \(O(\log N)\) steps to locate the midpoint.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(\log N)\), due to the recursion stack for a balanced tree.
