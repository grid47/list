### Problem Statement
The task is to find two integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that:
1. Both \(a\) and \(b\) are divisors of \(num + 1\) or \(num + 2\).
2. The product \(a \times b\) is as close to \(num\) as possible, where \(num\) is a given integer.
3. If multiple pairs of divisors satisfy this condition, the pair with the larger \(a\) should be preferred.

### Approach
To solve this problem, we can utilize the following approach:
1. **Iterate Backwards**: Start from the square root of \(num + 2\) and check for divisors in descending order. This helps us find larger divisors first, thus aligning with the requirement to prefer larger values of \(a\).
2. **Check Divisibility**: For each integer \(a\) from the square root down to 1, check if \(a\) divides \(num + 1\) or \(num + 2\). If it does, compute \(b\) as \((num + 1) / a\) or \((num + 2) / a\).
3. **Return Result**: Once a valid pair is found, return it immediately since we start from the largest possible divisor.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> closestDivisors(int num) {
        // Start iterating from the integer part of the square root of (num + 2)
        for(int a = sqrt(num + 2); a > 0; a--) {
            // Check if 'a' is a divisor of (num + 1)
            if((num + 1) % a == 0) 
                return vector<int>{a, (num + 1) / a}; // Return the pair {a, b}

            // Check if 'a' is a divisor of (num + 2)
            if((num + 2) % a == 0) 
                return vector<int>{a, (num + 2) / a}; // Return the pair {a, b}
        }
        // Return an empty vector if no divisors are found (shouldn't happen)
        return vector<int>{};
    }
};
```

1. **Function Declaration**:
   - The method `closestDivisors` is defined as a public member of the `Solution` class and takes an integer `num` as input.

2. **Looping Through Potential Divisors**:
   - The loop begins by calculating the square root of \(num + 2\) using `sqrt(num + 2)`. This value is stored in the variable `a`, which will be decremented in each iteration to check for divisors.

3. **Divisibility Checks**:
   - In the first condition, the code checks if \(num + 1\) is divisible by \(a\). If true, it constructs a vector with the values \(a\) and \((num + 1) / a\) and immediately returns this vector.
   - The second condition performs the same check for \(num + 2\). If this condition holds, it also returns the respective divisor pair.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - If no divisors are found (which is unlikely), the function returns an empty vector.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**:
  - The time complexity is \(O(\sqrt{num})\). This is because we iterate from \(\sqrt{num + 2}\) down to 1 to find divisors. The number of iterations is proportional to the square root of the input, making this approach efficient for large values of `num`.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are using a constant amount of extra space for the variables and the output vector. The vector returned holds two integers, but this does not depend on the size of the input.

### Conclusion
The `closestDivisors` function efficiently finds two integers that are divisors of either \(num + 1\) or \(num + 2\) and that multiply to a product closest to \(num\). By leveraging the properties of divisors and iterating from the square root downwards, the implementation achieves both correctness and optimal performance. This approach is particularly useful in competitive programming and algorithm design, where understanding divisor properties can lead to more efficient solutions.
