### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, the value `val`, and an integer `d`, you need to add a row of nodes with the value `val` at the given depth `d`. If `d` is 1, the new row will be added above the root. If `d` is greater than the height of the tree, the new row will be added at the bottom of the tree.

### Approach
1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `d == 1`, create a new root node with the value `val` and attach the existing root as its left child.
   - If `d == 0`, create a new root node with the value `val` and attach the existing root as its right child.

2. **Recursive Depth Handling**:
   - If `d == 2`, for each child of the current node, create a new node with the value `val` and link it to the current node. The existing child becomes the child of the new node.
   - If `d > 2`, recursively call the function for the left and right children, decrementing `d` by 1 each time.

3. **Return the Modified Tree**:
   - Return the modified tree.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree due to the recursive call stack.
