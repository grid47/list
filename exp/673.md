### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of longest increasing subsequences (LIS) in the array. An increasing subsequence is defined as a sequence where each element is greater than the previous one.

### Approach
The solution uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence while also counting how many times this maximum length occurs.

1. **Dynamic Programming Arrays**:
   - `len[i]`: Stores the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.
   - `cnt[i]`: Stores the count of the longest increasing subsequences that end at index `i`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - For each index `i`, initialize `len[i]` and `cnt[i]` to `1` since the minimum length of an increasing subsequence that ends with any element is `1` (the element itself).

3. **Building the DP Arrays**:
   - For each element `nums[i]`, iterate through all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`):
     - If `nums[j] < nums[i]`, then:
       - If extending the subsequence from `j` to `i` gives a subsequence of the same length as `len[i]`, increment the count at `cnt[i]` by `cnt[j]`.
       - If extending the subsequence from `j` to `i` gives a longer subsequence, update `len[i]` and set `cnt[i]` to `cnt[j]`.

4. **Calculate the Result**:
   - After populating the `len` and `cnt` arrays, determine the maximum length of the LIS (`max_len`).
   - Count the total number of subsequences that have this maximum length.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Input**: The function takes a vector of integers, `nums`.
2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: Two loops are used to build the `len` and `cnt` arrays, checking all previous indices for potential subsequences.
3. **Output**: The function returns the total count of the longest increasing subsequences.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the length of `nums`, due to the nested loops for filling `len` and `cnt`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the `len` and `cnt` arrays, which are used to store intermediate results.
