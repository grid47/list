### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to find the number of ways to fill an array of length `n` with integers from 1 to `k`, ensuring that the integers can be used in various combinations while respecting certain constraints. Specifically, the function takes a 2D vector `q` where each entry consists of two integers `n` and `k`, representing the size of the array and the upper limit of values that can be used, respectively. The goal is to determine the number of ways to fill the array for each pair `(n, k)`.

### Approach

To tackle this problem, the solution employs a combinatorial approach combined with the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently count the number of prime factors of `k`. The main steps involved in the approach are:

1. **Prime Factorization Using Sieve**: Precompute all prime numbers up to a certain limit (in this case, 100) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This is critical as the prime factors of `k` will dictate how we can fill the array.

2. **Combinatorial Calculations**: Use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of distinct ways to fill the array given the prime factorization of `k`. This involves calculating combinations using Pascal's Triangle, which provides a way to compute binomial coefficients efficiently.

3. **Iterate Through Queries**: For each query, determine how many times each prime factor divides `k` and use the previously computed combinatorial values to calculate the result.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**: As the number of ways can be very large, the results are computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow and adhere to standard practices in competitive programming.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's delve into the code step by step to understand how the approach is implemented.

1. **Class Definition**: The solution is wrapped in a class named `Solution`.

   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   ```

2. **Sieve Function**: The `sieve` function is defined to find all prime numbers up to a given `num`.

   ```cpp
   vector<int> sieve(int num) {
       vector<bool> tes(num + 1, true);
       tes[0] = false;
       tes[1] = false;
       for(int i = 2; i < num/2 + 1; i++) {
           if(tes[i]) {
               for(int j = i * i; j <= num; j += i)
                   tes[j] = false;
           }
       }
       vector<int> ans;
       for(int i = 0; i <= num; i++)
           if(tes[i]) ans.push_back(i);
       return ans;
   }
   ```

   - The sieve initializes a boolean array to track prime numbers. It iterates through potential prime numbers and marks their multiples as non-prime.

3. **Pre-compute Combinations**: The next section sets up the `comb` array to store binomial coefficients, where `comb[i][j]` represents the number of ways to choose `j` items from `i`.

   ```cpp
   vector<vector<int>> comb(10013, vector<int>(14, 0));
   comb[0][0] = 1;
   for(int i = 1; i < 10013; i++)
       for(int j = 0; j < 14; j++)
           comb[i][j] = j == 0? 1: ( comb[i - 1][j - 1] + comb[i - 1][j] ) % mod;
   ```

   - This uses Pascal's Triangle to compute combinations efficiently.

4. **Initialize Result Vector**: An answer vector `ans` is initialized to hold the result for each query.

   ```cpp
   vector<int> ans(q.size(), 1);
   ```

5. **Processing Each Query**: For each query `(n, k)`, we decompose `k` into its prime factors and count the number of ways to fill the array.

   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < q.size(); i++) {
       int n = q[i][0], k = q[i][1];
       for(int x : primes) {
           int cnt = 0;
           while(k % x == 0) {
               k = k / x;
               cnt++;
           }
           ans[i] = (long) ans[i] * comb[n - 1 + cnt][cnt] % mod;
       }
       if(k != 1) ans[i] = (long) ans[i] * n % mod;
   }
   ```

   - For each prime, the count of how many times it divides `k` is determined, and the corresponding combinations are multiplied into the result.

6. **Return Results**: Finally, the computed results for each query are returned.

   ```cpp
   return ans;
   }
   ```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the Sieve of Eratosthenes is \(O(n \log(\log(n)))\), where \(n\) is the upper limit for primes. The overall complexity for processing each query depends on the number of primes and the size of the array, leading to a complexity of \(O(q \cdot p)\), where \(q\) is the number of queries and \(p\) is the number of prime factors.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is primarily \(O(n)\) for storing the prime numbers and \(O(m \cdot n)\) for the combination table, where \(m\) is the maximum size needed for combinations.

### Conclusion

The solution effectively combines combinatorial mathematics and number theory to address the problem of filling an array with constraints on the integer values. By utilizing the Sieve of Eratosthenes for prime factorization and precomputing binomial coefficients, the algorithm efficiently computes the required results for multiple queries. This approach highlights the power of combining mathematical principles with algorithmic techniques, ensuring that the solution is both efficient and elegant. Through this method, we can handle large inputs and complex queries with ease, adhering to performance standards typical in competitive programming and algorithm design.
