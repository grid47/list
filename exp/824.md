### Problem Statement
The goal is to convert a given string of words into "Goat Latin." The rules for converting words to Goat Latin are as follows:
1. If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), append "ma" to the end of the word.
2. If a word begins with a consonant, remove the first letter and append it to the end of the word, followed by "ma."
3. After the "ma," append a number of 'a's equal to the position of the word in the original sentence (1 for the first word, 2 for the second, etc.).

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: Use a stringstream to read the input string and a set to identify vowels.
2. **Word Processing**: For each word, check if it starts with a vowel or consonant and apply the corresponding transformation. Append the appropriate number of 'a's based on the word's position.
3. **Output Formation**: Construct the final string with the transformed words.

### Code Walk-through
- The `toGoatLatin` function initializes a stringstream and a set of vowels.
- It processes each word in the input string:
  - If the word starts with a vowel, it appends "ma" and the appropriate number of 'a's.
  - If it starts with a consonant, it modifies the word accordingly and then appends "ma" and the 'a's.
- The final string is returned after removing the leading space.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the input string. Each word is processed in linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the resulting transformed string.
