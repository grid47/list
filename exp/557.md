### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, reverse the order of the words in the string. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words are separated by spaces, and you should not change the order of the characters in each word.

### Approach
1. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - Loop through the characters of the string while tracking the starting index of each word.
   - Whenever a space is encountered, the word between the previous start index and the current index is reversed.
   - At the end of the string, reverse the last word.

2. **Reverse Function**:
   - Create a helper function `rev` that takes the string and two indices. This function swaps characters between the two indices until they meet.

### Code Walk-through
- The function `reverseWords` processes the input string `s`.
- For each space found, it calls the `rev` function to reverse the characters between the previously tracked index and the current index.
- At the end of the loop, it checks if the end of the string has been reached and reverses the last word if necessary.
- Finally, the modified string with reversed words is returned.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since the reversing is done in place without using additional space proportional to the input size.
