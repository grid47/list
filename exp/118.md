### Problem Statement
Generate the first `numRows` of Pascal's triangle.

### Approach
1. Initialize a 2D vector `r` with `numRows` rows.
2. For each row `i`:
   - Set the first and last elements to 1 (`r[i][0]` and `r[i][i]`).
   - For each element in the row (from index 1 to `i-1`), calculate its value as the sum of the two elements above it from the previous row: `r[i][j] = r[i - 1][j - 1] + r[i - 1][j]`.
3. Return the completed 2D vector representing Pascal's triangle.

### Code Walk-through
- **`generate` function**:
  - **Line 2**: Create a 2D vector `r` with `numRows` rows.
  - **Line 4**: Loop through each row index `i`.
  - **Line 5**: Resize the `i`-th row to `i + 1`.
  - **Line 6**: Set the first and last elements of the row to 1.
  
- **Line 8-10**: Fill in the values of the current row:
  - Loop through column indices `j` from 1 to `i-1`.
  - Calculate the value of `r[i][j]` using the values from the previous row.

- **Line 12**: Return the completed triangle stored in `r`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) is `numRows`, as we fill in \(1 + 2 + ... + N = \frac{N(N + 1)}{2}\) elements.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N^2)\) for the storage of the triangle in a 2D vector.
