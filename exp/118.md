### Problem Statement

The problem asks to generate the first `numRows` of **Pascal's Triangle**. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first few rows of Pascal’s Triangle look like this:

```
     1
    1 1
   1 2 1
  1 3 3 1
 1 4 6 4 1
```

Given an integer `numRows`, you are required to return a 2D list that represents the first `numRows` of Pascal's Triangle.

For example:
- **Input**: `numRows = 5`
- **Output**: 
```
[
     [1],
    [1, 1],
   [1, 2, 1],
  [1, 3, 3, 1],
 [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
]
```

### Approach

Pascal’s Triangle can be built iteratively by using the following properties:
1. The first and last element of each row is always `1`.
2. Each interior element at position `j` in row `i` is the sum of the elements at positions `j-1` and `j` from the previous row (`i-1`).

The algorithm involves:
- Initializing an empty list of vectors to store the rows.
- Iteratively building each row based on the previous one, updating the elements using the properties mentioned above.
- Returning the final 2D vector after all rows are generated.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. **Function Signature**
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> generate(int numRows)
```
This function generates the first `numRows` of Pascal’s Triangle and returns it as a 2D vector of integers.

#### 2. **Initialize Result Storage**
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> r(numRows);
```
We create a vector `r` of size `numRows`, where each element is itself a vector. This will store the rows of Pascal's Triangle.

#### 3. **Iterate Through Each Row**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
    r[i].resize(i + 1);
    r[i][0] = r[i][i] = 1;
```
- We loop over each row `i` from 0 to `numRows - 1`.
- For each row, we resize the vector `r[i]` to have `i + 1` elements (because the i-th row has `i + 1` elements).
- We set the first and last elements of each row to `1` since that’s the defining characteristic of Pascal’s Triangle.

#### 4. **Fill Interior Elements**
```cpp
for (int j = 1; j < i; j++)
    r[i][j] = r[i - 1][j - 1] + r[i - 1][j];
```
- This inner loop starts from index `1` and goes up to `i - 1`. The values at these positions in row `i` are the sum of the elements from the previous row:
  - The element at position `j` in row `i` is the sum of the element at position `j-1` and `j` in row `i-1`.

#### 5. **Return the Result**
```cpp
return r;
```
Once all rows have been populated, we return the 2D vector `r` containing Pascal’s Triangle.

### Example Walkthrough

Let’s walk through an example to understand the steps more clearly:

**Input**: `numRows = 5`

1. **Initial Setup**:
   We initialize a 2D vector `r` with 5 rows: `r = { {}, {}, {}, {}, {} }`.

2. **Building Each Row**:

   - **Row 0 (i = 0)**: 
     - Resize to 1 element: `r[0] = { 1 }`.
   
   - **Row 1 (i = 1)**:
     - Resize to 2 elements: `r[1] = { 1, 1 }`.
   
   - **Row 2 (i = 2)**:
     - Resize to 3 elements: `r[2] = { 1, _, 1 }`.
     - The second element is filled with `r[1][0] + r[1][1] = 1 + 1 = 2`, so `r[2] = { 1, 2, 1 }`.
   
   - **Row 3 (i = 3)**:
     - Resize to 4 elements: `r[3] = { 1, _, _, 1 }`.
     - The second element is filled with `r[2][0] + r[2][1] = 1 + 2 = 3`, and the third element is filled with `r[2][1] + r[2][2] = 2 + 1 = 3`, so `r[3] = { 1, 3, 3, 1 }`.
   
   - **Row 4 (i = 4)**:
     - Resize to 5 elements: `r[4] = { 1, _, _, _, 1 }`.
     - The second element is filled with `r[3][0] + r[3][1] = 1 + 3 = 4`, the third element is filled with `r[3][1] + r[3][2] = 3 + 3 = 6`, and the fourth element is filled with `r[3][2] + r[3][3] = 3 + 1 = 4`, so `r[4] = { 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 }`.

3. **Final Output**:
   After completing the loops, the 2D vector `r` becomes:
   ```
   [
       [1],
      [1, 1],
     [1, 2, 1],
    [1, 3, 3, 1],
   [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
   ]
   ```
   This is the first 5 rows of Pascal’s Triangle, which is the correct output.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(numRows^2)`
  - Each row `i` has `i + 1` elements, and we fill each element in every row. The total number of elements is the sum of integers from 1 to `numRows`, which is proportional to `numRows^2` (since the sum of the first `n` integers is `n(n + 1)/2`).

- **Space Complexity**: `O(numRows^2)`
  - We store `numRows` rows, and each row `i` contains `i + 1` elements, resulting in a total of `numRows^2` elements in the 2D vector.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently generates Pascal’s Triangle by building each row iteratively and using previously computed values to fill the current row. The time complexity is quadratic, which is the best achievable for this problem, and the space complexity is also quadratic, as we need to store the entire triangle. The approach is simple yet effective, leveraging the properties of Pascal’s Triangle to fill the values in a systematic manner.
