### Problem Statement
Design a nested iterator to traverse a nested list of integers. Each element in the nested list can be either an integer or another list of integers. Implement the `NestedIterator` class that provides the ability to iterate through this nested structure as if it were a flat list of integers.

### Approach
1. **Data Structure**: 
   - Utilize two stacks: `begins` to track the current position in each list and `ends` to track the end of each list. This helps manage the state of traversal through the nested structure.

2. **Constructor**:
   - Initialize the stacks by pushing the beginning and ending iterators of the outermost list onto them.

3. **Next Function**:
   - Call `hasNext()` to ensure that the next integer is ready to be returned.
   - Retrieve the integer from the current position and increment the iterator.

4. **HasNext Function**:
   - Continuously check the top of the `begins` stack:
     - If the current iterator equals the end iterator, pop both stacks to move up a level in the nested structure.
     - If the current element is an integer, return `true`.
     - If the current element is a list, push its begin and end iterators onto the respective stacks, advancing to the next element.

### Code Walk-through
- **Initialization**: The iterator starts at the beginning of the nested list.
- **Iteration**: The `next()` method retrieves the next integer, while `hasNext()` checks if there are any remaining integers to iterate through.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(1)\) for `next()` and `hasNext()` in the average case, but can be up to \(O(n)\) in the worst case when traversing nested lists.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(d)\), where \(d\) is the maximum depth of the nested lists, due to the stack storage.
