### Problem Statement

The problem asks to distribute candies to children standing in a line, with the condition that:
- Every child gets at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating than their neighbors must receive more candies than their neighbors.

Given an integer array `rate`, where each element represents the rating of a child, the task is to determine the **minimum number of candies** needed to satisfy the above conditions.

### Approach

The problem can be solved using a **greedy approach** by iterating through the list of ratings twice:
1. **First pass (left to right)**: Traverse the list from left to right, ensuring that each child with a higher rating than the one before gets more candies.
2. **Second pass (right to left)**: Traverse the list from right to left, ensuring that each child with a higher rating than the one after them gets more candies. If the child already has more candies from the first pass, retain that value.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialization

First, we check if the size of the `rate` array is 1 or less. In this case, the answer is simply the number of children, as each child gets at least one candy.

```cpp
int size = rate.size();

if (size <= 1) return size;
```

Then, we initialize a `num` array of the same size as `rate`, where each child initially receives 1 candy.

```cpp
vector<int> num(size, 1);
```

#### Step 2: First Pass (Left to Right)

The first pass ensures that children with higher ratings than their left neighbor receive more candies. This is done by iterating through the array from left to right (i.e., from index `1` to `size - 1`).

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
    if (rate[i] > rate[i - 1])
        num[i] = num[i - 1] + 1;
}
```

- If the current child’s rating is greater than the previous child’s rating (`rate[i] > rate[i - 1]`), we assign the current child a candy count of one more than the previous child (`num[i] = num[i - 1] + 1`).

#### Step 3: Second Pass (Right to Left)

The second pass ensures that children with higher ratings than their right neighbor also receive more candies. We iterate from right to left (i.e., from index `size - 2` to `0`).

```cpp
for (int i = size - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    if (rate[i - 1] > rate[i])
        num[i - 1] = max(num[i - 1], num[i] + 1);
}
```

- If the current child’s rating is greater than the next child’s rating (`rate[i - 1] > rate[i]`), we update the candy count of the current child to ensure it is greater than the next child (`num[i - 1] = max(num[i - 1], num[i] + 1)`).
- The `max` function ensures that we do not decrease the candy count for a child if they already received more candies in the first pass (i.e., the child may have already been assigned a higher number of candies).

#### Step 4: Summing the Total Candies

Once the two passes are completed, the array `num` contains the minimum number of candies each child should receive. The final step is to sum up the values in the `num` array to get the total number of candies required.

```cpp
int res = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
    res += num[i];

return res;
```

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We iterate through the `rate` array twice: once from left to right and once from right to left. Each pass takes O(n) time, where `n` is the number of children (size of the `rate` array). Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We use an extra array `num` of size `n` to store the number of candies each child should receive. Therefore, the space complexity is **O(n)**.

### Conclusion

This solution leverages a **greedy approach** to efficiently distribute the minimum number of candies to children in a way that satisfies the problem’s constraints. It ensures:
- Each child receives at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating than their neighbors receive more candies.

The solution is optimal with a linear time complexity of **O(n)**, making it well-suited for larger input sizes. By performing two passes over the `rate` array (left to right and right to left), the algorithm ensures that the minimum number of candies is distributed in an efficient manner.

The space complexity of **O(n)** arises from the need to store the number of candies for each child in the `num` array. This solution guarantees that the constraints are satisfied while minimizing the total number of candies.
