### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `rate` where each element represents the rating of a child. You need to distribute candies to children such that:
1. Each child receives at least one candy.
2. Children with a higher rating than their neighbors receive more candies than those neighbors.

The task is to determine the minimum number of candies needed.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a `num` array of the same size as `rate`, initialized with 1, to represent the minimum candies each child receives.

2. **Left to Right Pass**:
   - Traverse the `rate` array from left to right. If the current child's rating is greater than the previous child's rating, increase the current child's candy count to one more than the previous child's.

3. **Right to Left Pass**:
   - Traverse the `rate` array from right to left. If the current child's rating is greater than the next child's rating, ensure the current child has more candies than the next child by taking the maximum of the current count and one more than the next child's count.

4. **Calculate the Result**:
   - Sum up the values in the `num` array to get the total number of candies needed.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 5-7**: Check for the edge case where the size of `rate` is less than or equal to 1 and return that size.
- **Line 9**: Initialize a `num` vector to track the number of candies each child will receive.
- **Line 11-14**: First pass (left to right) to assign candies based on the increasing ratings.
- **Line 16-19**: Second pass (right to left) to adjust candies based on the decreasing ratings.
- **Line 21-23**: Sum up the candies from the `num` array to get the final result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of children (size of the `rate` array), as we make two passes through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\), for the `num` array used to store the number of candies for each child.
