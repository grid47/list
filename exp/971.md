### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree and a vector `voyage`, determine if it is possible to flip some nodes in the tree so that the resulting tree's preorder traversal matches the given `voyage`. If flipping is necessary, return the values of the nodes that were flipped. If it's impossible to match the `voyage`, return `[-1]`.

### Approach
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Perform a DFS traversal of the tree, comparing the values of nodes with the `voyage` vector.
   - Keep track of the current index in the `voyage` vector.

2. **Node Value Check**:
   - If the value of the current node does not match the expected value in `voyage`, return `false`.
   - If the left child exists but the next value in `voyage` does not match the left childâ€™s value, flip the current node by pushing its value onto the result vector and recursively traverse the right child first, followed by the left child.

3. **Return Values**:
   - If all nodes match and no invalid conditions are encountered, return the result vector containing the flipped node values.
   - If the traversal cannot match the `voyage`, return a vector containing `-1`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **`flipMatchVoyage` Method**:
   - Initializes a result vector `res` and an index `i`.
   - Calls the `dfs` function to begin the traversal.
   - Returns the result or `[-1]` based on the traversal outcome.

2. **`dfs` Method**:
   - Checks if the current node is null and returns `true`.
   - Compares the current node's value to the corresponding value in `voyage`.
   - Handles the condition for flipping nodes and recursively checks the appropriate child nodes.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, as we potentially visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where `h` is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.
