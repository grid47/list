### Problem Statement
Given a `m x n` grid, you need to find the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, where you can only move either down or right at any point in time.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Create a 2D vector `dp` of size `m x n` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths to reach cell `(i, j)`.

2. **Base Case Initialization**:
   - Set `dp[0][0]` to `1`, as there's one way to be at the starting cell (by starting there).
   - Fill the first row and the first column with `1` since there is only one way to reach any cell in the first row (by moving right) and the first column (by moving down).

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Use nested loops to fill the DP table:
     - For each cell `(i, j)`, the number of unique paths to that cell is the sum of the paths from the cell directly above `(i - 1, j)` and the cell directly to the left `(i, j - 1)`, thus:
       \[
       dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]
       \]

4. **Result**:
   - The value in `dp[m - 1][n - 1]` will be the total number of unique paths to reach the bottom-right corner.

### Code Walk-through
- **Initialization**: The DP table is initialized with base values.
- **Dynamic Filling**: The nested loops populate the DP table based on the defined transition.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(m \times n) \) since every cell in the grid is computed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(m \times n) \) for storing the DP table.
