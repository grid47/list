### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

### Approach
1. **Use of Map**: A map (or unordered set) is utilized to track the occurrences of each element in the array.
   
2. **Process**:
   - Iterate through each element in the `nums` array.
   - For each element, check if it already exists in the map.
   - If it exists, return `true` indicating a duplicate is found.
   - If it does not exist, insert it into the map.

### Code Walk-through
- **containsDuplicate**: The main function that checks for duplicates:
  - Initialize a map to store counts of elements.
  - Loop through each element in the array.
  - If the element is found in the map, return `true`.
  - Otherwise, add the element to the map.
  - If the loop completes without finding duplicates, return `false`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. Each insertion and lookup in the map takes \(O(1)\) on average.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) in the worst case, where all elements are unique and stored in the map.
