### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, you need to find the length of the shortest subarray that, if sorted, will make the entire array sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Approach
1. **Sorting with Index Tracking**:
   - Create a temporary vector `tmp` that pairs each element in `nums` with its original index.
   - Sort this temporary vector. After sorting, the original indices will help determine which elements are out of place.

2. **Identify the Unsorted Subarray**:
   - Traverse the sorted `tmp` array to find the first and last positions where the indices differ from their original positions.
   - The first discrepancy gives the starting index (`start`) of the unsorted subarray, while the last discrepancy gives the ending index (`end`).

3. **Compute the Length**:
   - If no discrepancies are found (i.e., the array is already sorted), return 0.
   - Otherwise, return the length of the identified unsorted subarray as `end - (start - 1)`.

### Code Walk-through
- The function begins by creating the `tmp` array that contains pairs of values and their indices.
- After sorting `tmp`, it checks for the first and last indices that indicate the boundaries of the unsorted subarray.
- Finally, it computes and returns the length of the unsorted subarray.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`, due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the temporary storage of pairs in `tmp`.
