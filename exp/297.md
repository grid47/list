### Problem Statement
Design a codec that encodes a binary tree to a string and decodes a string back to the binary tree. The encoded string should be a representation of the tree structure that allows for complete reconstruction.

### Approach
The solution uses a depth-first traversal approach to serialize and deserialize the binary tree:

1. **Serialization**:
   - Use a pre-order traversal (root, left, right) to serialize the tree.
   - For each node, append its value to a string. If a node is `nullptr`, append a special marker (e.g., `#`) to indicate the absence of a node.
   - Separate values with spaces for easy parsing during deserialization.

2. **Deserialization**:
   - Split the serialized string by spaces to reconstruct the tree.
   - Use a recursive function to read values from the string and build the tree back, using the same pre-order logic.
   - When a `#` is encountered, return `nullptr` for that node.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A binary tree node `root` for serialization and a serialized string `data` for deserialization.
- **Output**: The serialized string from the tree and the reconstructed tree from the serialized string.

1. **Serialize Function**:
   - Takes a pointer to the root of the tree and an output string stream.
   - If the node is not `nullptr`, its value is added to the output stream, followed by recursive calls for the left and right children.
   - If the node is `nullptr`, a `#` is added to indicate the absence of a node.

2. **Deserialize Function**:
   - Takes an input string stream and reads the next value.
   - If the value is `#`, it returns `nullptr`. Otherwise, it creates a new node and recursively builds the left and right subtrees.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - \(O(n)\) for both serialization and deserialization, where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - \(O(n)\) for the serialized string storage and the recursion stack during deserialization.
