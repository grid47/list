### Problem Statement

The problem is about designing a **Codec** class that can serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Serialization means converting a binary tree into a string format that can be stored or transmitted, while deserialization means converting that string back into the original binary tree. This is a typical problem that requires efficient techniques to manage and transfer hierarchical data structures like binary trees.

The problem consists of two core operations:
1. **serialize(TreeNode* root)** – This function should convert the binary tree into a string.
2. **deserialize(string data)** – This function should take a string representation of the tree and reconstruct the original binary tree.

### Approach

To solve the problem, the key challenge is how to efficiently convert the tree structure into a string and later recover it from the string. The approach used in this solution is **preorder traversal**, which involves visiting the root node first, followed by recursively visiting the left and right subtrees.

The approach works in two steps:
1. **Serialization**: We use preorder traversal to visit each node. For each node:
   - If the node is not `NULL`, we append the node’s value to the string.
   - If the node is `NULL`, we append a placeholder (in this case, `#`) to represent the absence of a node.
   
   This ensures that every node, whether it is a leaf node or `NULL`, is included in the string. The string can then be used to reconstruct the tree.

2. **Deserialization**: To reconstruct the tree from the string, we read the string and recursively build the tree. Every time we encounter a value, we create a new node and recursively reconstruct its left and right subtrees, using the same logic as the serialization step.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### **TreeNode Definition**:

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};
```
- This structure represents a binary tree node. Each node contains an integer value (`val`) and pointers to its left and right children (`left` and `right`).

#### **Codec Class Declaration**:

```cpp
class Codec {
public:
    string serialize(TreeNode* root);
    TreeNode* deserialize(string data);
};
```
- The `Codec` class has two primary functions:
  - `serialize(TreeNode* root)` which converts the tree to a string.
  - `deserialize(string data)` which converts the string back to a tree.

#### **Serialization**:

```cpp
string serialize(TreeNode* root) {
    ostringstream out;
    serialize(root, out);
    return out.str();
}
```
- The `serialize` method starts the serialization process. It creates an `ostringstream` object (`out`) to accumulate the serialized data.
- It calls the helper method `serialize(root, out)` to actually fill up the `ostringstream` object with the tree's data.
- Finally, it returns the serialized tree as a string.

#### **Helper Method for Serialization**:

```cpp
void serialize(TreeNode* root, ostringstream& out) {
    if (root) {
        out << root->val << ' ';
        serialize(root->left, out);
        serialize(root->right, out);
    } else {
        out << "# ";
    }
}
```
- This method performs **preorder traversal** of the binary tree. For each node:
  - If the node is not `NULL`, the node's value is written to the string (`out`) followed by a space, and the method is recursively called for the left and right children.
  - If the node is `NULL`, a placeholder (`#`) is written to represent the absence of a node.
  
#### **Deserialization**:

```cpp
TreeNode* deserialize(string data) {
    istringstream in(data);
    return deserialize(in);
}
```
- The `deserialize` method is the entry point for deserialization. It takes a string (`data`) and converts it into an `istringstream` object (`in`) to read the values.
- It then calls the helper method `deserialize(in)` to start building the tree from the stream.

#### **Helper Method for Deserialization**:

```cpp
TreeNode* deserialize(istringstream& in) {
    string val;
    in >> val;
    if (val == "#")
        return nullptr;
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(stoi(val));
    root->left = deserialize(in);
    root->right = deserialize(in);
    return root;
}
```
- The helper method reads values from the input stream (`in`).
- If the current value is a `#`, it means the current node is `NULL`, so the method returns `nullptr`.
- If the value is a valid number, it creates a new `TreeNode` with that value, then recursively builds the left and right subtrees by calling `deserialize` on the stream.

### Complexity

#### **Time Complexity**:
- **serialize**: 
  - The serialization process involves visiting each node once. Since there are `n` nodes in the binary tree, the time complexity is **O(n)**.
  
- **deserialize**: 
  - Deserialization also involves reading each node’s value once and reconstructing it. Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n)** as well.

#### **Space Complexity**:
- **serialize**: 
  - The space complexity for storing the string is **O(n)**, as each node (including `NULL` nodes) is stored in the string.
  
- **deserialize**: 
  - During deserialization, we are constructing a binary tree with `n` nodes, which requires **O(n)** space for the tree structure.
  
Overall, both the **time complexity** and **space complexity** for both operations are **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

### Conclusion

The provided solution for serializing and deserializing a binary tree using preorder traversal is efficient and easy to implement. By representing `NULL` nodes with a placeholder (`#`), the solution handles all cases (including trees with missing nodes or uneven structures) correctly.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Preorder traversal** allows us to store the structure of the tree, including `NULL` nodes, in a string format.
- The **recursion** used during both serialization and deserialization ensures that the tree is accurately reconstructed.
- Both the **time complexity** and **space complexity** of the solution are optimal for this problem, making it a great choice for handling tree serialization in practice.

This approach is useful in many real-world applications where binary trees need to be transmitted or stored efficiently, such as in databases, network communications, or data transfer protocols.
