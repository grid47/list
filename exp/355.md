### Problem Statement

The problem involves designing a simplified version of Twitter, where users can post tweets, follow/unfollow other users, and view a news feed that consists of tweets from themselves and their followed users.

Key operations include:
- **Posting a tweet**: A user can post a tweet, and each tweet is associated with a timestamp.
- **Getting the news feed**: A user can view their news feed, which includes their own tweets and tweets from the users they follow, sorted by timestamp (most recent first).
- **Following and unfollowing users**: A user can follow and unfollow other users, affecting what appears in their news feed.

### Approach

To implement this Twitter-like system, we must manage user information, handle tweet posting, and compute the news feed efficiently. The basic steps and data structures we use are:

1. **User and Tweet Management**: 
   - Each user has a unique ID, a set of followed users, and a linked list of tweets.
   - Each tweet contains an ID, timestamp, and a pointer to the next tweet.
   - Users can follow/unfollow other users, which affects the tweets shown in their news feed.

2. **Tweet Ordering**:
   - The most recent tweets should appear first in the news feed.
   - For efficient ordering, we can use a priority queue (heap), where tweets with higher timestamps are given higher priority.
   
3. **Data Structure**:
   - **User Map**: A map (`userMap`) stores each user by their unique ID. This allows us to quickly access a user's data (e.g., followed users, tweets).
   - **Tweet Linked List**: Each user has a linked list of their tweets, stored in the `tweet_head` pointer.
   - **Priority Queue**: To fetch the most recent tweets, we use a priority queue that orders tweets based on their timestamp.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Define the `Tweet` Class

The `Tweet` class represents an individual tweet:
```cpp
class Tweet {
public:
    int id;  // Unique identifier for the tweet
    int time;  // Timestamp for when the tweet was posted
    Tweet* next;  // Pointer to the next tweet in the linked list

    Tweet(int id, int time) {
        this->id = id;
        this->time = time;
        next = NULL;
    }
};
```
- The `Tweet` class has three data members: `id`, `time`, and `next`.
- `next` is used to create a linked list of tweets for each user, where each tweet points to the next tweet in the sequence.
  
#### Step 2: Define the `User` Class

The `User` class stores information about a user, including their followed users and tweets:
```cpp
class User {
public:
    int id;
    set<int> followed;  // Set of users this user is following
    Tweet* tweet_head;  // Head of the linked list of tweets

    User(int id) {
        this->id = id;
        follow(id);  // Follow self by default
        tweet_head = NULL;
    }

    void follow(int id) {
        followed.insert(id);  // Add the user to the followed list
    }

    void unfollow(int id) {
        followed.erase(id);  // Remove the user from the followed list
    }

    void post(int id, int times) {
        Tweet* t = new Tweet(id, times);  // Create a new tweet
        t->next = tweet_head;  // Insert the tweet at the head of the list
        tweet_head = t;
    }
};
```
- **follow()**: Adds the user to the list of followed users.
- **unfollow()**: Removes the user from the list of followed users.
- **post()**: Adds a tweet to the user's tweet list by inserting it at the head of the linked list.

#### Step 3: Define the `Twitter` Class

The `Twitter` class manages the main functionalities: posting tweets, following/unfollowing users, and retrieving the news feed:
```cpp
class Twitter {
public:
    int timeStamp = 0;  // Global timestamp for all tweets
    map<int, User*> userMap;  // Map storing users by their ID

    Twitter() {
        // Constructor to initialize the Twitter system
    }

    void postTweet(int userId, int tweetId) {
        if (!userMap.count(userId)) {
            User* u = new User(userId);  // Create a new user if not exists
            userMap[userId] = u;
        }
        userMap[userId]->post(tweetId, timeStamp++);  // Post the tweet with the current timestamp
    }
```
- `userMap` stores users by their ID, so we can easily retrieve user data.
- `postTweet()` allows a user to post a tweet with a unique ID and timestamp. If the user does not exist, they are created first.

#### Step 4: Implement the `getNewsFeed()` Function

The `getNewsFeed()` function retrieves the most recent tweets from the user and the users they follow:
```cpp
    vector<int> getNewsFeed(int userId) {
        vector<int> res;
        if (!userMap.count(userId)) {
            return res;  // Return empty result if user does not exist
        }

        set<int> users = userMap[userId]->followed;  // Get the list of users the user is following
        priority_queue<Tweet*, vector<Tweet*>, compare> pq;  // Max-heap to store tweets

        // Push the most recent tweet from each followed user into the priority queue
        for (int user : users) {
            Tweet* t = userMap[user]->tweet_head;
            if (t != NULL)
                pq.push(t);
        }

        int n = 0;
        while (!pq.empty() && n < 10) {  // Retrieve at most 10 tweets
            Tweet* t = pq.top();  // Get the tweet with the highest timestamp
            pq.pop();  // Remove it from the queue
            res.push_back(t->id);  // Add the tweet's ID to the result
            n++;
            if (t->next != NULL)
                pq.push(t->next);  // Push the next tweet from the same user
        }
        return res;  // Return the result containing tweet IDs
    }
```
- We use a **priority queue** to always retrieve the most recent tweet.
- The priority queue is sorted by the tweet's timestamp, ensuring that we get the tweets in descending order of time.
- We push the most recent tweet of each followed user into the queue. If the user has more tweets, the next tweet is pushed into the queue to be processed.

#### Step 5: Implement the `follow()` and `unfollow()` Functions

These methods manage user relationships:
```cpp
    void follow(int followerId, int followeeId) {
        if (!userMap.count(followerId)) {
            User* u = new User(followerId);
            userMap[followerId] = u;
        }
        if (!userMap.count(followeeId)) {
            User* u = new User(followeeId);
            userMap[followeeId] = u;
        }
        userMap[followerId]->follow(followeeId);  // Make the follower follow the followee
    }

    void unfollow(int followerId, int followeeId) {
        if (userMap.count(followerId) && followerId != followeeId)
            userMap[followerId]->unfollow(followeeId);  // Make the follower unfollow the followee
    }
};
```
- `follow()` makes a user follow another user.
- `unfollow()` allows a user to stop following another user, but prevents a user from unfollowing themselves.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **postTweet**: O(1) — Inserting a tweet is a constant time operation.
- **getNewsFeed**: O(N log N), where `N` is the total number of tweets from the followed users. This is due to the use of the priority queue, where inserting and removing from the heap takes logarithmic time.
- **follow/unfollow**: O(1) — Insertion and removal from the set are constant-time operations.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(N)** where `N` is the number of tweets across all users. This accounts for the memory used by the `Tweet` objects and the `userMap` storing users and their tweets.

### Conclusion

This Twitter simulation efficiently handles the operations of posting tweets, following/unfollowing users, and retrieving a user's news feed. The use of a priority queue ensures that tweets are ordered by timestamp, and the use of sets allows fast checking of follow relationships. This solution is optimized for both time and space, offering quick access to the latest tweets while maintaining an organized structure for user data.
