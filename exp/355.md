### Problem Statement
Design a simplified version of Twitter where users can post tweets, follow other users, and get a news feed of their tweets. 

### Approach
1. **Data Structures**:
   - **Tweet**: A structure to hold tweet ID and timestamp, linked to the next tweet.
   - **User**: A structure to hold user ID, a set of followed users, and the head of their tweet list.
   - **Twitter**: The main class to manage users and their interactions.

2. **Operations**:
   - **Post Tweet**: Users can post a tweet with a unique ID, which is stored in their linked list of tweets.
   - **Get News Feed**: Retrieve the 10 most recent tweets from the user's feed, including tweets from followed users, sorted by time.
   - **Follow/Unfollow**: Users can follow or unfollow other users to customize their news feed.

3. **Priority Queue**: A min-heap (priority queue) is used to efficiently get the latest tweets from followed users.

### Code Walk-through
- Each user is represented by an instance of the `User` class, which maintains a list of followed users and their tweets.
- The `Twitter` class maintains a map of user IDs to `User` objects. 
- The `postTweet` function adds a new tweet for a user and increments the timestamp.
- The `getNewsFeed` function retrieves the latest tweets from all followed users, using a priority queue to ensure tweets are sorted by time.
- Users can follow and unfollow others, modifying their list of followed users.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Posting a tweet: \( O(1) \)
  - Getting news feed: \( O(N \log k) \), where \( N \) is the number of tweets from followed users and \( k \) is the number of users being followed (up to 10 tweets).
  - Following/Unfollowing: \( O(1) \)
  
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - The space complexity is \( O(M + U) \), where \( M \) is the total number of tweets and \( U \) is the number of users.
