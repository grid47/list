### Problem Statement
Given an array of non-negative integers `nums`, where each element represents your maximum jump length at that position, determine if you can reach the last index starting from the first index.

### Approach
1. **Track the Furthest Reachable Index**:
   - Use a variable `mx` to keep track of the maximum index that can be reached at each step.
   
2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - Loop through each index `i` of the array.
   - If `mx` is less than `i`, it means that the current index is not reachable, so return `false`.
   - Update `mx` to the maximum of its current value and `i + nums[i]` (the furthest index that can be reached from index `i`).
   - If `mx` reaches or exceeds the last index (`n - 1`), return `true` as it indicates that the end is reachable.

### Code Walk-through
- **Initialization**:
   - Start with `mx` set to `0` and determine the size of the array `n`.
- **Traversal**:
   - In the `for` loop, check if the current index is reachable. Update `mx` as needed.
   - The output of `mx` at each iteration is printed for debugging purposes.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the array, since we only make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \), as we use a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
