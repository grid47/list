### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to determine whether it is possible to reach the last index of an array starting from the first index, given that each element in the array represents the maximum jump length you can make from that position. You are allowed to jump forward, but the goal is to figure out if you can make it to the last element.

For example, consider the input array:

```
[2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
```

In this case, you can jump from index 0 to index 1 (since nums[0] = 2), then from index 1 to index 4 (since nums[1] = 3), and thus reach the last index. The output for this example would be `true`.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a greedy approach. The idea is to iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum index (`mx`) that can be reached at each step. If at any point the current index exceeds this maximum reachable index (`mx`), then it is impossible to reach the end, and we return `false`. If we reach the last index or beyond, we return `true`.

The key insight is that the number at each index tells you the maximum distance you can jump from that index. As you progress, we want to keep track of the farthest index we can reach. If at any point, the farthest index is less than the current index, it means you are "stuck" and cannot progress further, so the answer will be `false`. If you can jump to or beyond the last index at any point, you return `true`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

```cpp
int mx = 0;
int n = nums.size();
```

- `mx` represents the maximum index that can be reached so far. It is initially set to `0`, meaning we start at the first index.
- `n` stores the size of the input array `nums`.

#### Step 2: Loop Through the Array

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if(mx < i) return false;
    mx = max(mx, i + nums[i]);
    cout << mx << ' ';
    if(mx >= nums.size() - 1) return true;
}
```

- **For loop:** We iterate through each index `i` in the array `nums`.
  
- **Check if stuck:** The condition `if(mx < i)` checks if the maximum reachable index is less than the current index `i`. This means that we cannot progress to the current index, so we return `false`.

- **Update maximum reachable index:** The line `mx = max(mx, i + nums[i]);` updates the maximum index that can be reached. We calculate the maximum by considering the current index `i` and the jump length `nums[i]`. The `max` function ensures that `mx` holds the farthest index we can reach at any given point in the loop.

- **Debug output:** The `cout << mx << ' '` outputs the current value of `mx` for debugging purposes. This shows how the maximum reachable index changes as we iterate through the array.

- **Check if last index is reachable:** The condition `if(mx >= nums.size() - 1)` checks if the maximum reachable index `mx` has reached or exceeded the last index (`nums.size() - 1`). If it has, we can reach the last index, and we return `true`.

#### Step 3: Return `false` if Loop Completes

```cpp
return false;
```

- If the loop completes without returning `true`, it means that it is not possible to reach the last index, so we return `false`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

- **O(n):** The algorithm makes a single pass over the array with a single loop running from 0 to `n-1`. For each index, the constant-time operations (comparison, maximum update, and print) are performed. Thus, the time complexity is linear, O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array.

#### Space Complexity:

- **O(1):** The solution uses only a few additional variables (`mx` and `n`), regardless of the size of the input array. Therefore, the space complexity is constant, O(1).

### Conclusion

The provided solution efficiently determines whether it is possible to reach the last index of the array using a greedy approach. The key idea is to keep track of the farthest index that can be reached at each step and ensure that the current index is always reachable. If at any point the current index exceeds the maximum reachable index, it is impossible to continue, and we return `false`. If we can reach or exceed the last index, we return `true`.

This greedy approach ensures an optimal solution with linear time complexity, O(n), and constant space complexity, O(1). This makes the solution ideal for handling large input sizes efficiently. Additionally, the approach is simple to understand and implement, making it a popular choice for problems involving array traversal and jump-based algorithms.
