### Problem Statement

The problem asks to determine the account balance after making a purchase, given an initial balance of **100**. The function takes an integer `val`, representing the cost of the purchase, and adjusts the account balance after making the purchase. The rules for the adjustment are based on the last digit of `val`:

1. If the last digit of `val` is **5**, the balance is adjusted by adding 5 to the purchase amount.
2. If the last digit of `val` is **greater than 5**, the value is rounded up to the next multiple of 10.
3. If the last digit of `val` is **less than 5**, the value is rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10.

The function then returns the balance after subtracting the adjusted purchase amount from the initial balance of 100.

### Approach

The goal is to calculate the account balance after a purchase, considering how the purchase amount is rounded based on its last digit. The main operations involve rounding the purchase value based on the last digit and subtracting this from the starting balance (100).

1. **Identify the last digit**:
   The last digit of the purchase value `val` will determine how the value should be rounded. This can be easily done by calculating `val % 10`.

2. **Round the value**:
   - If the last digit is **5**, we add 5 to the value.
   - If the last digit is **greater than 5**, we round the value down to the nearest multiple of 10, then add 10 to it (round up).
   - If the last digit is **less than 5**, we round down to the nearest multiple of 10.

3. **Subtract from the starting balance**:
   Once the value has been adjusted based on the last digit, subtract the adjusted purchase value from the initial balance of 100 to get the result.

4. **Return the result**:
   Finally, the function returns the adjusted balance.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   int accountBalanceAfterPurchase(int val) {
   ```
   - The function `accountBalanceAfterPurchase` takes an integer `val` (the value of the purchase) and returns the remaining balance after the purchase.

2. **Handling the Last Digit Equal to 5**:
   ```cpp
   if(val % 10 == 5) val += 5;
   ```
   - The first `if` statement checks if the last digit of `val` is **5** (i.e., `val % 10 == 5`). 
   - If true, the purchase value is adjusted by adding 5 to it, rounding the value to the nearest multiple of 10 (e.g., 15 becomes 20, 25 becomes 30, etc.).

3. **Handling Last Digit Greater Than 5**:
   ```cpp
   else if(val % 10 > 5) {
       val = val / 10;
       val = (val + 1) * 10;
   }
   ```
   - The second `else if` statement checks if the last digit of `val` is **greater than 5** (i.e., `val % 10 > 5`).
   - If true, the value of `val` is first divided by 10 to remove the last digit, and then 1 is added to the result. This effectively rounds up to the next integer (e.g., 62 becomes 70, 83 becomes 90).
   - The result is then multiplied by 10 to restore the last digit as 0 (i.e., rounding to the nearest higher multiple of 10).

4. **Handling Last Digit Less Than 5**:
   ```cpp
   else {
       val = (val / 10) * 10;
   }
   ```
   - The `else` block handles the case where the last digit of `val` is **less than 5**.
   - The value is rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10 by dividing `val` by 10 (removing the last digit) and then multiplying by 10 (restoring the last digit as 0).

5. **Return the Remaining Balance**:
   ```cpp
   return 100 - val;
   ```
   - After adjusting the purchase value, the function subtracts the adjusted value from 100 to calculate the remaining balance.
   - The result is returned.

### Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The function performs constant-time operations (`%`, `/`, and `*`) on the integer `val` and only involves a few conditional checks. Therefore, the **time complexity** of the function is **O(1)**.
   - This means the execution time remains constant regardless of the size of the input `val`.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The function only uses a few integer variables (i.e., `val`), and no additional data structures are used. Therefore, the **space complexity** of the function is **O(1)**, meaning it uses constant space.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently calculates the account balance after a purchase, considering the last digit of the purchase value and adjusting the value accordingly. The function handles the three cases of rounding based on the last digit (5, greater than 5, or less than 5) and computes the final balance by subtracting the adjusted value from 100. With a time complexity of **O(1)** and space complexity of **O(1)**, this solution is optimal for this problem and can handle a large number of cases efficiently.
