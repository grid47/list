### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `arr`, return the number of distinct values of the bitwise OR of all possible subarrays.

### Approach
1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use three unordered sets:
     - `res`: to store the distinct OR values from all subarrays.
     - `cur`: to store the current OR values for the ongoing subarray.
     - `cur2`: to calculate the new OR values for the current element.

2. **Iterate through the Array**:
   - For each element `x` in `arr`:
     - Initialize `cur2` with the current element `x`.
     - Iterate through `cur` and compute the bitwise OR of each value in `cur` with `x`, inserting the results into `cur2`.
     - Update `cur` with the contents of `cur2` and insert all elements of `cur` into `res`.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return the size of `res`, which contains all distinct OR values.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to find distinct bitwise OR values.
    - `int subarrayBitwiseORs(vector<int>& arr)`: Computes the number of distinct bitwise ORs from all subarrays of `arr`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * k), where n is the number of elements in `arr` and k is the number of distinct OR results from each step (bounded by 32 for 32-bit integers).
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), as it stores the distinct OR values in sets.
