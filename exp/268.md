### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one number that is missing from the array.

### Approach
The solution utilizes the properties of the XOR operation, which is effective for finding a missing number:

1. **XOR Properties**:
   - \(a \oplus a = 0\) (any number XORed with itself is 0).
   - \(a \oplus 0 = a\) (any number XORed with 0 remains unchanged).
   - XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations does not matter.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Start with `sum` initialized to the first element of `nums`.
   - XOR all elements of `nums` to `sum`.
   - XOR `sum` with all integers from `0` to `n` (where `n` is the size of `nums`).
   - The result in `sum` will be the missing number since all other numbers will cancel out due to the properties of XOR.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A vector `nums` containing `n` distinct integers.
- **Output**: The missing integer from the range `[0, n]`.

1. Initialize `sum` with the first element of `nums`.
2. Loop through `nums`, starting from index `1`, and XOR each element with `sum`.
3. Loop from `0` to `n`, XORing each integer with `sum`.
4. Return `sum`, which now contains the missing number.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`, as we traverse the array and the range once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since no additional space is used aside from a few variables.

### Edge Cases
1. **Missing Zero**: If the array is `[1]`, the function should correctly return `0`.
2. **Full Range**: If the array includes all elements except one, the function should identify the missing one correctly.
