### 🚀 Problem Statement

In this problem, you’re given an array `nums` of integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), and the array contains `n` distinct numbers. Your goal is to find the missing number from the range `0` to `n`. 

For example:
- **Input**: `nums = [3, 0, 1]`
- **Output**: `2`
  - The array contains the numbers `0`, `1`, and `3`, so the missing number is `2`.

Let's dive into an efficient approach to solve this! 🏃‍♂️💨

### 🧠 Approach

The key to solving this problem efficiently is the **XOR (exclusive OR)** operation, which has some awesome properties that help us identify the missing number in no time! ⚡

1. **Properties of XOR**:
   - `a ^ a = 0` (XOR of any number with itself is 0)
   - `a ^ 0 = a` (XOR of any number with 0 is the number itself)
   - XOR is both commutative and associative, which means the order of operations doesn’t matter.

Given these properties, XOR is like a magic tool for canceling out matching numbers. Here’s the trick:
- XOR all elements of the array with the numbers from `0` to `n`.
- Numbers that appear in both the array and the range cancel out, and the missing number is the one that’s left!

### 🔨 Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Let’s break down the code to see how XOR works its magic! ✨

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
```
- We define a function `missingNumber` inside the `Solution` class, which takes an array `nums` as input and returns the missing number from the range `0` to `n`.

```cpp
        int sum = nums[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++)
            sum ^= nums[i];
```
- First, we initialize a variable `sum` with the first element of the array `nums[0]`. 
- Then, we loop through the rest of the array and XOR `sum` with each element. This ensures we accumulate the XOR of all the elements in the array.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i <= nums.size(); i++)
            sum ^= i;
```
- In the second loop, we XOR `sum` with all integers from `0` to `n` (where `n = nums.size()`).
- This ensures that all the numbers in the range `0` to `n` are included, and the numbers that appear in both the array and the range will cancel out.

```cpp
        return sum;
    }
};
```
- After both loops, `sum` will hold the missing number because all other numbers have canceled out. We return `sum`, which is our final result! 🎉

### 📈 Complexity Analysis

Let's see how efficient our solution is! 🔍

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the array `nums`. 
  - We have two loops:
    - The first loop processes all the elements in the array (`nums.size()` iterations).
    - The second loop processes all integers from `0` to `n` (another `n + 1` iterations).
  - Since both loops iterate linearly over the array and the range, the overall time complexity is proportional to the size of the array.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**, constant space. 
  - The algorithm only uses a few variables (`sum`, `i`), which do not depend on the size of the input array. No additional space is required, so it's super space-efficient! 💡

### 🏁 Conclusion

We’ve now solved the problem efficiently using XOR. Let’s quickly recap the main points:

#### Key Takeaways:
1. **XOR Properties**: XOR is a powerful tool that helps us find the missing number by canceling out matching numbers.
2. **Optimal Time Complexity**: The solution runs in **O(n)** time, which is great for large inputs.
3. **No Extra Space**: With **O(1)** space complexity, the solution doesn’t require any additional memory, making it space-efficient.
4. **Simplicity**: XOR operations simplify the problem, allowing us to find the missing number in just a few lines of code! ✨

### 🎯 Quick Recap:
