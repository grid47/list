### Problem Statement
Given a string `S`, the task is to find the number of distinct non-empty subsequences of `S`. Since the number of subsequences can be large, return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming with Ends Array**:
   - Use an array `endsWith` of size 26 (for each letter in the alphabet) to store the count of distinct subsequences ending with each character.
   
2. **Iterate Over Characters**:
   - For each character in the string `S`, update the `endsWith` array:
     - Calculate the total number of distinct subsequences that can be formed by adding the current character. This is done by taking the sum of all existing subsequences and adding one for the new subsequence created by the current character.
     - The count for each character is updated in `endsWith`.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Since the results can be large, use modular arithmetic to prevent overflow, ensuring all calculations are done modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The result is the sum of all distinct subsequences ending with each character, excluding the empty subsequence.

### Code Walk-through
- The function initializes an array to keep track of subsequences ending with each character.
- It loops through each character in `S`, updating the counts based on the current character.
- Finally, it sums the values in `endsWith` to get the total number of distinct subsequences, returning the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the string `S`. The algorithm processes each character once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since the `endsWith` array size is constant (26).
