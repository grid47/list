### Problem Statement
You are given a string representation of a linear equation in one variable, which can be of the form `ax + b = cx + d`. Your task is to solve for `x` and return the solution in the format `x=value`, or return "Infinite solutions" if there are infinitely many solutions, or "No solution" if no solution exists.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use variables to keep track of the coefficients of `x` (denoted as `xpara`) and the constant terms (denoted as `para`).
   - Set a `flag` to manage the sign of the coefficients based on their position in the equation (before or after the equals sign).

2. **Parsing the Equation**:
   - Traverse the string character by character.
   - Depending on the character, update the coefficients and constant terms:
     - If the character is `=`, switch the `flag` to indicate that the following terms belong to the right side of the equation.
     - If the character is a sign (`+` or `-`), adjust the `sgn` accordingly.
     - If the character is a digit, parse the entire number and update either `xpara` or `para` based on whether the term includes `x`.

3. **Final Evaluation**:
   - After parsing the entire equation, check the values of `para` and `xpara`:
     - If both are zero, return "Infinite solutions".
     - If `xpara` is zero but `para` is non-zero, return "No solution".
     - Otherwise, compute the solution for `x` as `-para/xpara`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Loop through Characters**: The while loop continues until the end of the string, processing each character.
2. **Sign Management**: The sign of each term is determined based on the preceding characters.
3. **Coefficient Calculation**: The coefficients of `x` and the constant terms are calculated based on the parsed numbers and their signs.
4. **Result Construction**: Finally, construct the result string based on the values of `para` and `xpara`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the equation string, as each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since only a fixed number of integer variables are used for calculations.
