### Problem Statement
Given a number of cities, a list of flights represented as edges in a graph, and a maximum number of stops, find the cheapest price for a flight from a source city to a destination city.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a distance vector `c` to store the minimum cost to reach each city. Initialize all cities with a large value (infinity) except for the source city, which is set to zero.

2. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm iterates through the flights up to \( k + 1 \) times. This is because a valid path can include up to \( k \) stops, leading to \( k + 1 \) vertices in total.
   - In each iteration, create a temporary distance vector `C` based on the current distances in `c`. For each flight (edge) from city \( u \) to city \( v \) with cost \( w \):
     - Update the cost to reach \( v \) if using flight \( (u, v) \) offers a cheaper price: 
       \[
       C[v] = \min(C[v], c[u] + w)
       \]
   - After processing all flights, update `c` with the values from `C`.

3. **Result**:
   - After \( k + 1 \) iterations, check the distance to the sink. If it remains at the initialized large value, return -1 indicating that the destination cannot be reached within the given number of stops. Otherwise, return the computed cost.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to find the cheapest flight price.
    - `int findCheapestPrice(int n, vector<vector<int>>& a, int src, int sink, int k)`: Main function to compute the cheapest price.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `n`: Number of cities.
        - `a`: Vector of edges, where each edge is represented as a vector `[from, to, price]`.
        - `src`: The source city index.
        - `sink`: The destination city index.
        - `k`: The maximum number of stops allowed.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(k * E), where \( E \) is the number of edges (flights) in the graph, as we perform \( k + 1 \) iterations over all edges.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the distances to each city in the vector `c`.
