### Problem Statement
Given two strings, `name` and `typed`, determine if `typed` is a valid long-pressed version of `name`. A long-pressed version of `name` can be obtained by pressing some characters of `name` multiple times (including zero times).

### Approach
1. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Use two pointers: `i` for `name` and `j` for `typed`.
   - Traverse through `typed` using the pointer `j` while checking the corresponding character in `name` using pointer `i`.

2. **Character Matching**:
   - If the characters at both pointers match (`name[i] == typed[j]`), increment `i` to move to the next character in `name`.
   - If there’s a mismatch and it’s not a repeated character from the previous position in `typed`, return false.
   - If the current character in `typed` is not equal to the previous character, it indicates a new character not matching `name`.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After traversing `typed`, check if all characters in `name` were matched by ensuring `i` equals the length of `name`.

### Code Walk-through
- Initialize two pointers: `i` for `name` and `j` for `typed`.
- Iterate through each character in `typed`:
  - If characters match, increment the pointer for `name`.
  - If there’s a mismatch and it’s not a repeat character, return false.
- At the end, check if all characters of `name` were accounted for by ensuring `i` equals the length of `name`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of `typed`, as we traverse it once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space for pointers.
