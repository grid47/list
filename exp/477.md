### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums`. The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. The total Hamming distance is the sum of Hamming distances between all pairs of integers in the array.

### Approach
1. **Understanding Hamming Distance**:
   - The Hamming distance between two numbers is calculated by comparing each bit of both numbers.
   - For each bit position, if one number has a `1` and the other has a `0`, it contributes to the Hamming distance.

2. **Counting Bits**:
   - For each bit position (from 0 to 31), count how many numbers have that bit set (i.e., `1`).
   - The number of integers that do not have that bit set will be the total number of integers minus the count of integers with that bit set.

3. **Calculating Contribution**:
   - For each bit position `i`, the contribution to the total Hamming distance from that bit can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{contribution} = \text{bitCount} \times (n - \text{bitCount})
     \]
   - Here, `bitCount` is the number of integers with a `1` in the `i`-th position, and `(n - bitCount)` is the count of integers with a `0` in the same position.

4. **Summing Contributions**:
   - Sum all contributions from all bit positions to get the total Hamming distance.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `totalHammingDistance()` takes a vector of integers as input.

2. **Nested Loops**:
   - The outer loop iterates through the 32 bits, and the inner loop counts the number of `1`s at each bit position.

3. **Total Calculation**:
   - For each bit, the contribution to the total is calculated and added to the `total`.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the computed total Hamming distance.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(32 * n), which simplifies to O(n), where `n` is the number of integers in the array since 32 is a constant.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since no additional space is used that scales with input size.
