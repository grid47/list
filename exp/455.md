### Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays: `g` representing the greed factor of each child and `s` representing the size of each cookie. Each child can be content if their greed factor is less than or equal to the size of the cookie. Your goal is to find the maximum number of content children.

### Approach
1. **Sorting**:
   - Sort both arrays `g` and `s` to facilitate a greedy approach where we attempt to satisfy the least greedy child with the smallest available cookie.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Use two pointers, one for the children (`i`) and one for the cookies (`j`).
   - Iterate through both arrays:
     - If the current cookie size (`s[j]`) can satisfy the current child's greed (`g[i]`), move to the next child (`i++`).
     - Regardless of whether the cookie was used, move to the next cookie (`j++`).

### Code Walk-through
1. **Sorting the Arrays**:
   - Sort the arrays `g` and `s` in non-decreasing order.

2. **Greedy Allocation**:
   - Initialize two pointers `i` (for children) and `j` (for cookies).
   - Traverse through the cookies while checking if each cookie can satisfy the current child's greed:
     - If `s[j]` (cookie size) is greater than or equal to `g[i]` (child's greed), increment the child pointer `i`.
   - Always increment the cookie pointer `j`.

3. **Result**:
   - The final value of `i` represents the number of content children.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N + M log M), where N and M are the sizes of arrays `g` and `s`, due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
