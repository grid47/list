### Problem Statement
In a game, two players take turns picking numbers from either end of a list of integers. The goal is to determine if the first player can win given optimal play from both players. The first player wins if they can achieve a score greater than or equal to the second player’s score.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
   - Use a recursive function with memoization to store already computed results for subproblems defined by the current left index `l`, right index `r`, and the current score difference `net`.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Base Case: If there’s only one number left (`l == r`), return that number.
   - Memoization: Check if the result for the current state `(l, r, net)` is already computed. If yes, return it.
   - Recursive Cases:
     - Calculate the score if the left number is picked.
     - Calculate the score if the right number is picked.
   - Update the memoization table with the maximum score difference achievable.

3. **Determine Winner**:
   - Calculate the total score of all numbers.
   - The first player wins if their score is greater than or equal to half of the total score.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `predictTheWinner()` function initializes necessary variables and calls the `dp()` function.

2. **DP Function**:
   - The `dp(int l, int r, int net)` function computes the score difference for the player starting at the indices `l` and `r` with a total score of `net`.

3. **Return Result**:
   - After computing the score difference, check if the first player’s score is at least half of the total score.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in `nums`, due to the memoized DP solution.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) for the memoization table storing the results for all pairs `(l, r)`.
