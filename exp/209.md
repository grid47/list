### Problem Statement

The problem requires finding the minimal length of a contiguous subarray in an array of integers that has a sum greater than or equal to a given target value. If no such subarray exists, return 0. This is a common problem that can be approached using sliding window techniques to achieve an efficient solution.

### Approach

To solve the problem of finding the minimal length subarray with a sum greater than or equal to the target, we can use the **sliding window technique**. The sliding window method involves maintaining a window (or subarray) of elements and adjusting its size dynamically as we traverse the array. 

The key idea is to expand the window to include elements and contract the window to reduce the size while still meeting the target sum. By keeping track of the sum of the elements within the window, we can check if it meets or exceeds the target. When it does, we try to shrink the window from the left to find the smallest valid subarray.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's walk through the code step by step:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSubArrayLen(int target, vector<int>& nums) {
        int sum = 0, idx = 0, g = INT_MAX, bdx = 0;
```
- **sum**: This variable stores the sum of the current subarray.
- **idx**: The `idx` variable is used to expand the window by iterating through the array from left to right.
- **g**: This variable keeps track of the minimum length of a subarray that meets or exceeds the target sum. It is initialized to `INT_MAX` to represent the worst-case scenario where no valid subarray is found.
- **bdx**: The `bdx` (beginning index) variable is used to shrink the window from the left side.

```cpp
        while(idx < nums.size()) {
            sum += nums[idx];
```
- The `while` loop runs through the array using the `idx` index, and for each element in the array, we add it to the `sum` variable. This step expands the window by including one more element at a time.

```cpp
            while(sum >= target) {
                g = min(g, idx - bdx + 1);
                sum -= nums[bdx];
                bdx++;
            }
```
- The inner `while` loop checks whether the current `sum` is greater than or equal to the `target`. If the sum meets the target, we:
  1. Calculate the length of the current subarray (from `bdx` to `idx`) and update `g` with the smaller length between the current value of `g` and the length of the current subarray.
  2. Shrink the window from the left by subtracting the value at `nums[bdx]` from `sum` and incrementing `bdx`. This effectively removes the leftmost element from the subarray.

```cpp
            idx++;
        }
```
- After processing the current element, we increment `idx` to expand the window further and check the next element.

```cpp
        return g == INT_MAX ? 0 : g;
    }
};
```
- Finally, if `g` is still `INT_MAX`, it means no valid subarray was found, so we return 0. Otherwise, we return the value of `g`, which is the length of the smallest subarray that meets the target sum.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.
  - The `idx` pointer iterates through the entire array once, and for each `idx`, the `bdx` pointer only moves forward. Therefore, both pointers together traverse the array at most once, making the overall time complexity linear.

#### Space Complexity:

- The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables (`sum`, `g`, `bdx`, `idx`). No additional data structures like arrays or hashmaps are used that would grow with the input size.

### Conclusion

The sliding window technique used in this solution is an efficient approach to solving the problem of finding the minimum length subarray with a sum greater than or equal to a given target. This method ensures that both the time and space complexities remain optimal, with **O(n)** time complexity and **O(1)** space complexity.

#### Key Steps:
- We expand the window by adding elements to the sum.
- We contract the window by removing elements from the left side as long as the sum still meets the target.
- By keeping track of the minimum subarray length at each step, we efficiently find the solution.

This approach is ideal for scenarios where we need to solve problems involving contiguous subarrays or sliding windows, as it allows for dynamic resizing of the window without unnecessary recalculations. The solution is optimal for large input sizes due to its linear time complexity, making it suitable for real-time applications where performance is crucial.
