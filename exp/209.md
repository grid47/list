### Problem Statement
Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return 0.

### Approach
1. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use two pointers to maintain a window of the current subarray.
   - `idx`: Pointer to expand the window by adding elements to the sum.
   - `bdx`: Pointer to shrink the window from the left when the sum is greater than or equal to the target.
  
2. **Sum Calculation**: 
   - Incrementally add elements to `sum` using `idx`.
   - Once `sum` is greater than or equal to `target`, try to minimize the length of the window by incrementing `bdx` and subtracting the leftmost element from `sum`.

3. **Result Storage**: Maintain a variable `g` to store the minimum length found. If no valid subarray is found by the end of the iteration, return 0.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 2**: Initialize variables `sum`, `idx`, `g` (to store the minimum length), and `bdx` (for the start of the window).
- **Line 3-4**: Begin iterating through the array with `idx`.
- **Line 5**: Add the current element to `sum`.
- **Line 7-10**: Check if `sum` is greater than or equal to `target`:
  - If true, update the minimum length `g` and adjust `sum` by removing the element at `bdx` while moving `bdx` forward.
- **Line 11**: Increment `idx` to expand the window.
- **Line 12**: Return `g` if it was updated; otherwise, return 0.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array. Each element is processed at most twice (once by `idx` and once by `bdx`).
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as no additional space is used that scales with input size.
