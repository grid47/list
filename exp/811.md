### Problem Statement
You are given a list of domain visit counts in the format `"<count> <domain>"`, where `<count>` is the number of visits and `<domain>` is the domain name. Your task is to return a list of visit counts for each subdomain, including the main domain itself.

### Approach
1. **Data Structure**:
   - Use an unordered map (`count`) to store the visit counts for each subdomain.

2. **Processing Each Domain**:
   - For each entry in `cpdomains`:
     - Split the string into the visit count (`n`) and the domain name (`s`).
     - For each domain, generate all possible subdomains by traversing the string and updating the counts in the map:
       - For example, if the domain is `google.com`, add counts for `com`, `google.com`, and `google.com` as a whole.

3. **Construct Result**:
   - Iterate over the map to construct the result vector containing strings in the format `"<count> <subdomain>"`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the vector containing all subdomain visit counts.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains methods to count visits to subdomains.
    - `vector<string> subdomainVisits(vector<string>& cpdomains)`: Main function to calculate subdomain visit counts.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `cpdomains`: A vector of strings representing the visit counts and domains.
      - **Returns**: A vector of strings representing the visit counts for each subdomain.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * k), where `m` is the number of domains and `k` is the average length of each domain string since each domain is processed in linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of unique subdomains stored in the map.
