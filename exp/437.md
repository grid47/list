### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree and a sum, find the number of paths that sum to the given value. A path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections.

### Approach
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Traverse the tree using DFS to explore all paths starting from each node.
   
2. **Path Testing**:
   - For each node, invoke a helper function to check all paths that can be formed from that node downwards.
   - Maintain a count of valid paths that sum to the specified value.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - A counter (`cnt`) is initialized to track the number of valid paths.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - The `dfs` function explores each node recursively, calling the `test` function for each node to check for valid paths.

3. **Path Testing Function**:
   - The `test` function checks if the current node value equals the remaining sum.
   - If it does, increment the counter.
   - Recursively call `test` for the left and right child nodes, adjusting the sum accordingly.

4. **Return Result**:
   - The total count of valid paths is returned.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2), where N is the number of nodes, due to potentially checking all paths for each node.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to recursive stack space.
