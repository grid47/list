### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a variable to keep track of the current subarray sum (`l`).
   - Use another variable to keep track of the maximum sum found so far (`g`).

2. **Iterate through the Array**:
   - For each element in the array:
     - Update `l` to be either the current element alone or the current element added to the previous sum (`l + nums[i]`).
     - Update `g` to be the maximum of itself and the current sum `l`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Initialization**:
   - Start both `l` and `g` with the first element of the array.
- **Iteration**:
   - For each subsequent element, check if adding it to `l` yields a greater sum than starting fresh from the current element.
   - Update `g` with the maximum value between the current `g` and `l`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in `nums`. We only make one pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \), since we use a constant amount of space for the variables.
