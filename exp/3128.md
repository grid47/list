### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to find the number of right-angled triangles that can be formed using cells in a 2D grid. The grid consists of `1`s and `0`s, where `1` represents a valid cell, and `0` represents an empty cell. A right-angled triangle can be formed when three points lie in a right-angled relationship in the grid. Specifically, the triangle's right angle must align with the grid axes, either horizontally or vertically.

The goal is to determine how many such right-angled triangles can be formed based on the given grid.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can break down the task into several sub-problems:

1. **Precompute Horizontal and Vertical Sums**: First, we compute two auxiliary grids:
   - `hr[i][j]`: The cumulative sum of `1`s from the leftmost column to column `j` in row `i`. This tells us how many `1`s there are to the left of a given cell in a particular row.
   - `vr[i][j]`: The cumulative sum of `1`s from the topmost row to row `i` in column `j`. This tells us how many `1`s there are above a given cell in a particular column.

2. **Count Right-Angled Triangles**: Once we have the horizontal and vertical sums, we can calculate the number of triangles that can be formed with each cell `(i, j)` as the right-angle vertex. The formula for calculating the number of triangles at a point `(i, j)` is:
   \[
   \text{Triangles at }(i, j) = (\text{number of 1s in row i to the right of } j) \times (\text{number of 1s in column j below } i)
   \]
   This formula accounts for the potential triangles that could be formed by using the current cell as the right-angle corner of the triangle.

3. **Accumulate the Results**: We then accumulate the number of triangles for each valid cell `(i, j)` where there is a `1`.

### Code Breakdown

#### Step 1: Initialize and Precompute Horizontal and Vertical Sums

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> hr = grid;
vector<vector<int>> vr = grid;
```
- Here, `hr` and `vr` are copies of the original grid `grid`. We will use these grids to store the cumulative counts of `1`s in the rows and columns, respectively.

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    for(int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
        hr[i][j] += hr[i][j - 1];
    }
}
```
- This loop precomputes the cumulative sum of `1`s in each row.
- For each row `i`, starting from column `1`, we accumulate the values of `grid[i][j]` into `hr[i][j]`.

```cpp
for(int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        vr[i][j] += vr[i - 1][j];
    }
}
```
- This loop precomputes the cumulative sum of `1`s in each column.
- For each column `j`, starting from row `1`, we accumulate the values of `grid[i][j]` into `vr[i][j]`.

#### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Right-Angled Triangles

```cpp
long long cnt = 0, net;
```
- We initialize `cnt` to accumulate the total number of right-angled triangles.

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    if(grid[i][j]) {
        net = (hr[i][n - 1] - 1) * ((vr[m - 1][j] - vr[i][j]) + (i > 0? vr[i - 1][j]: 0));
        cnt += net;
    }
}
```
- We loop through every cell `(i, j)` in the grid.
- If `grid[i][j] == 1`, we calculate the number of possible right-angled triangles with `(i, j)` as the right angle using the precomputed `hr` and `vr` arrays.
- The formula used for `net` computes the number of possible triangles:
  - `hr[i][n - 1] - 1` gives the number of `1`s to the right of column `j` in row `i` (since we need to exclude the current cell).
  - `(vr[m - 1][j] - vr[i][j]) + (i > 0? vr[i - 1][j]: 0)` gives the number of `1`s below cell `(i, j)` in column `j`. If `i > 0`, we add the number of `1`s above cell `(i, j)` to account for all `1`s in the same column.
- We add the result to `cnt`.

#### Step 3: Return the Final Result

```cpp
return cnt;
```
- After iterating through the entire grid and counting the triangles for every valid `(i, j)`, we return the total count `cnt` as the result.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**: 
  - We iterate over the entire grid to compute the cumulative horizontal and vertical sums in two separate loops, each with a time complexity of O(m * n).
  - We also iterate over the entire grid again to calculate the number of triangles, which is another O(m * n) operation.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(m * n).

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**: 
  - We use additional `m * n` space to store the `hr` and `vr` grids, which are used to calculate the number of triangles.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the number of right-angled triangles that can be formed in the given grid by leveraging precomputation techniques. The use of cumulative sums (`hr` and `vr`) ensures that we can quickly calculate the number of possible triangles at each cell. The overall time complexity of O(m * n) ensures that the solution works efficiently even for larger grids. 

The approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, making it suitable for use in competitive programming and real-world scenarios where similar grid-based problems arise. By handling the precomputation and applying the triangle-counting formula efficiently, the solution provides a robust and optimized way to solve the problem.
