### Problem Statement
Given a start gene string and an end gene string, along with a bank of valid gene mutations, determine the minimum number of mutations needed to transform the start gene into the end gene. If it is not possible, return -1.

### Approach
1. **Use of Unordered Set**: 
   - Store the gene bank in an unordered set for O(1) average time complexity during lookup.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Implement BFS to explore all possible mutations level by level.
   - Start with the `startGene`, and at each level, attempt to mutate each character in the gene.

3. **Mutation Generation**:
   - For each character in the current gene, generate all possible mutations by replacing it with 'A', 'T', 'G', or 'C'.
   - If a generated mutation exists in the bank, add it to the queue for further exploration.

4. **Termination**:
   - If the `endGene` is reached, return the current mutation step count.
   - If the queue is exhausted without reaching the `endGene`, return -1.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Convert the bank into an unordered set and check if the `endGene` is in the set.

2. **BFS Implementation**:
   - Use a queue to keep track of the current gene strings being processed and their corresponding mutation steps.
   - For each gene processed, generate all possible mutations and enqueue valid ones that exist in the bank.

3. **Step Count**:
   - Maintain a step counter to track the number of mutations taken to reach the `endGene`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * 4^L) where N is the number of genes in the bank and L is the length of the gene (8 in this case). Each gene can have 4 possible mutations for each of its 8 positions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the gene bank and O(N) for the queue in the worst case.
