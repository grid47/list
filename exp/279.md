### Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `n`, find the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer.

### Approach
The solution uses dynamic programming to build up the minimum count of perfect squares that sum to each integer up to `n`:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**:
   - Create a vector `cnt` of size `n + 1`, initialized to a maximum value (infinity). The `cnt[i]` will represent the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to `i`.
   - Set `cnt[0]` to `0` since zero can be formed by zero perfect squares.

2. **Filling the Array**:
   - Iterate through each number `i` from `1` to `n`.
   - For each `i`, iterate through each perfect square `j * j` such that `j * j <= i`. Update `cnt[i]` by taking the minimum of its current value and `cnt[i - j * j] + 1` (which represents using one additional perfect square).

3. **Return the Result**: The value at `cnt[n]` will give the least number of perfect squares that sum to `n`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A positive integer `n`.
- **Output**: The least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`.

1. Initialize a vector `cnt` of size `n + 1` with all elements set to `INT_MAX`.
2. Set `cnt[0]` to `0`.
3. Use nested loops:
   - The outer loop runs from `1` to `n`.
   - The inner loop runs from `1` until the square of `j` exceeds `i`, updating `cnt[i]`.
4. Return `cnt[n]`, which contains the minimum number of perfect squares for `n`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \sqrt{n})\) because the outer loop runs `n` times and the inner loop runs approximately `\sqrt{n}` times for each `i`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the `cnt` vector.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Input**: For `n = 1`, the result should be `1` (since \(1^2 = 1\)).
2. **Perfect Square Input**: If `n` is a perfect square (like `4`), the output should be `1`.
