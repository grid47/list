### Problem Statement
Given a list of strings, find the length of the longest uncommon subsequence (LUS). The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest string that is not a subsequence of any other string in the list. If there is no such string, return -1.

### Approach
1. **Iterate Through Each String**:
   - For each string in the list, check against all other strings to see if it is a subsequence of any of them.

2. **Check for Subsequence**:
   - Use a helper function `LCS` to determine if one string is a subsequence of another.

3. **Update Result**:
   - If a string is found that is not a subsequence of any other string, compare its length with the current longest uncommon length and update accordingly.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After checking all strings, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence found.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Main Function**:
   - Loop through each string, and for each string, loop through the others to check if it is a subsequence using the `LCS` function.
   - If a string is not a subsequence of any other string, update the maximum length.

2. **LCS Function**:
   - The function checks if string `a` is a subsequence of string `b` by iterating through `b` and trying to match characters from `a`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2 * m), where n is the number of strings and m is the average length of the strings, since for each string, we may need to check against every other string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the algorithm uses a constant amount of additional space.
