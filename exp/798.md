### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, you want to rotate the array to maximize the score. The score of a rotation is defined as the sum of indices `i` for which `nums[i]` is greater than `i`. Return the index of the rotation that maximizes the score.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Change Array**:
   - Create an array `change` of size `n` initialized to zero. This array will be used to track the changes in scores for different rotations.

2. **Calculate Changes**:
   - For each element `nums[i]`:
     - Calculate the rotation index where the current score will be affected. This is given by `(i - nums[i] + 1 + n) % n`.
     - Decrease the value at this index in the `change` array by 1, indicating that the score will drop for this rotation.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - Update the `change` array to compute the cumulative score changes using a prefix sum approach.
   - For each index from 1 to `n-1`, add the previous value and increment the score by 1 for each rotation.

4. **Find the Best Rotation**:
   - Use `max_element` to find the index of the maximum score in the `change` array. This index corresponds to the best rotation.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to determine the best rotation.
    - `int bestRotation(vector<int>& nums)`: Implements the logic for calculating the best rotation.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `nums`: A vector of integers representing the original array.
      - **Returns**: An integer representing the index of the best rotation that maximizes the score.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the size of the input array. The algorithm passes through the array a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the additional `change` array used to store score changes.
