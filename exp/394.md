### Problem Statement
Given an encoded string, implement a function to decode it. The encoding format consists of digits followed by a string in brackets. For example, "3[a2[c]]" decodes to "accaccacc".

### Approach
1. **Recursive Decoding**: Use a recursive helper function to decode the string. The main function initializes the process.
   
2. **Iterate Through Characters**: In the recursive function:
   - **Character Handling**:
     - If the character is not a digit, simply append it to the result string.
     - If a digit is encountered, it signifies the start of a new encoded section.
   
3. **Building the Number**: Extract the full number (which may consist of multiple digits) to determine how many times the subsequent string needs to be repeated.

4. **Recursive Call for Substring**: 
   - Skip the opening bracket and recursively call the function to decode the substring until the corresponding closing bracket is found.
   - Once the substring is decoded, repeat it `n` times as specified by the extracted number.

5. **End of Decoding**: Continue until the end of the string or until the closing bracket is found.

### Code Walk-through
- The `decodeString` function initializes the decoding process by calling the `decode` helper function with the input string and an index variable.
- The `decode` function handles both the digit parsing and the character concatenation, ensuring that nested encodings are correctly processed by the recursive calls.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as each character is processed at most a few times due to the recursion.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the maximum depth of the recursion stack, which corresponds to the number of nested encoded sections.
