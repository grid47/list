### Problem Statement
Implement a function that computes the sum of two integers without using the `+` operator.

### Approach
1. **Bit Manipulation**:
   - The sum of two integers can be obtained using bitwise operations:
     - **XOR (`^`)**: This operation gives the sum of two bits without considering the carry. For example, \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \) (carry 1) and \( 1 \oplus 0 = 1 \).
     - **AND (`&`)**: This operation helps in calculating the carry. The carry for each bit can be obtained by performing \( (a \& b) \) and then shifting it left by one position using `<<`. This left shift effectively moves the carry to the left to add it in the next significant bit.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - The function keeps applying the above logic until there is no carry left (i.e., `b` becomes 0).

### Code Walk-through
- The function `getSum(int a, int b)` checks if `b` is zero:
  - If yes, it returns `a` (the final sum).
  - If no, it computes the new `a` using the XOR of `a` and `b`, and computes the new `b` as the carry shifted left by one bit.
- This process continues recursively until all carries are resolved.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(1) \) because the number of operations is constant, regardless of the input size, given the fixed size of integer representation.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \) as no additional data structures are used.
