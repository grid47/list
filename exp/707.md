### Problem Statement
Design a linked list that supports the following operations:
1. `get(index)`: Get the value of the node at the specified index.
2. `addAtHead(val)`: Add a node with the value `val` at the head of the linked list.
3. `addAtTail(val)`: Add a node with the value `val` at the tail of the linked list.
4. `addAtIndex(index, val)`: Add a node with the value `val` at the specified index.
5. `deleteAtIndex(index)`: Delete the node at the specified index.

### Approach
- **Node Structure**: Create a `Node` class to represent each node in the linked list, which contains a value and a pointer to the next node.
- **Linked List Structure**: Create a `MyLinkedList` class that maintains:
  - `sz`: The current size of the linked list.
  - `head`: A pointer to the first node in the list.

### Operations
1. **Get**:
   - Check if the index is within bounds. If not, return -1.
   - Traverse the list until reaching the desired index and return the node's value.

2. **Add at Head**:
   - Call `addAtIndex(0, val)` to insert the value at the head of the list.

3. **Add at Tail**:
   - Call `addAtIndex(sz, val)` to append the value at the end of the list.

4. **Add at Index**:
   - Check if the index is valid (0 ≤ index ≤ size). If invalid, do nothing.
   - Create a new node with the given value.
   - If adding at index 0, set the new node's next pointer to the current head and update the head pointer.
   - For other indices, traverse the list to find the node just before the index and adjust the pointers accordingly.

5. **Delete at Index**:
   - Check if the index is valid. If not, do nothing.
   - If deleting the head (index 0), update the head pointer and delete the old head node.
   - For other indices, traverse the list to find the node just before the index, update pointers to bypass the node to be deleted, and then delete it.

### Code Walk-through
- **Node Class**: A simple structure for linked list nodes.
- **MyLinkedList Class**: 
  - Initializes with size 0 and a null head.
  - Implements methods for all required operations.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - `get`: O(n) in the worst case (traversing the list).
  - `addAtHead`: O(1).
  - `addAtTail`: O(n) in the worst case.
  - `addAtIndex`: O(n) in the worst case (if inserting near the end).
  - `deleteAtIndex`: O(n) in the worst case (if deleting near the end).
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the nodes in the linked list.
