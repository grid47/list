### Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if `s` is a subsequence of `t`. A string `s` is a subsequence of `t` if you can remove some characters from `t` (without changing the order of the remaining characters) to get `s`.

### Approach
1. **Pointer Initialization**: Use two pointers, `sdx` for string `s` and `tdx` for string `t`, both initialized to 0. These pointers will help track the current character being evaluated in each string.

2. **Iterate Through String `t`**: Loop through the characters of `t` using the `tdx` pointer:
   - If the current character in `t` matches the current character in `s` (i.e., `t[tdx] == s[sdx]`), increment the `sdx` pointer to check the next character in `s`.
   - If `sdx` reaches the length of `s`, this means all characters of `s` have been found in `t`, and we can return true.

3. **Completion Check**: If the loop completes and not all characters of `s` have been matched, return false.

### Code Walk-through
- The loop efficiently checks each character of `t` against `s`, leveraging pointer arithmetic to confirm the sequence order.
- The check for `s` being empty is handled at the start, ensuring an immediate return of true when applicable.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of string `t`, as we may need to traverse all characters in `t`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional data structures are used, just a few pointers.
