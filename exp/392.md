### 🚀 Problem Statement

We are tasked with checking whether a string `s` is a **subsequence** of another string `t`. A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. In this case, we want to determine if `s` can be formed as a subsequence of `t`. That means, all characters of `s` must appear in `t` in the same order, though not necessarily consecutively.

### 🧠 Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize a **two-pointer technique**. The idea is simple: traverse through string `t` while trying to match each character of string `s` in order. The two pointers will help us track our position in both strings, allowing us to efficiently determine if `s` is a subsequence of `t`.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Initial Check for Empty String**: If string `s` is empty, it is trivially a subsequence of any string, so we return `true` immediately.
   
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: We initialize two pointers:
   - `sdx` for string `s` (starting at 0).
   - `tdx` for string `t` (also starting at 0).
   
   We will iterate over `t` and try to match the characters of `s` one by one.

3. **Matching Characters**: As we iterate through `t`, whenever we find a character in `t` that matches the current character in `s`, we move the pointer `sdx` forward (to match the next character in `s`).

4. **Check Completion**: If we have matched all characters of `s` (i.e., `sdx` reaches the end of `s`), then `s` is a subsequence of `t`, and we return `true`.

5. **Return False**: If we finish the loop without matching all characters of `s`, we return `false`.

### 🔨 Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Here’s the code implementing the approach:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        if (s == "") return true;  // If s is empty, it's trivially a subsequence

        int sdx = 0, tdx = 0;  // Pointers for s and t
        while (tdx < t.size()) {
            if (t[tdx] == s[sdx]) {  // If characters match
                sdx++;  // Move to the next character in s
            }
            tdx++;  // Always move to the next character in t
            if (sdx == s.size()) {  // If we've matched all characters of s
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;  // If we couldn't match all characters of s
    }
};
```

#### Explanation of Code:
1. **Base Case for Empty String**:  
   - If `s` is empty, we return `true` because an empty string is a subsequence of any string.
   
2. **Initialize Pointers**:  
   - `sdx` tracks the current character of `s` we are trying to match.
   - `tdx` tracks the current character of `t` we are comparing with.

3. **Loop through `t`**:
   - We loop through `t` with `tdx`. If we find a character in `t` that matches the character in `s[sdx]`, we move `sdx` forward to check the next character in `s`.

4. **Match Completion**:
   - If `sdx` reaches the length of `s`, it means we've found all characters of `s` in `t`, and we return `true`.

5. **Return False**:  
   - If we finish the loop and haven't matched all characters of `s`, we return `false`.

### 📈 Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **Best Case**: If `s` is empty, we return `true` immediately, which takes **O(1)** time.
- **Worst Case**: In the worst case, we iterate over all characters in `t` once. Since we are only moving forward in both strings, the time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of string `t`. This is the time it takes to check all characters of `t` and possibly match all characters of `s`.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we only use a constant amount of space for the two pointers (`sdx` and `tdx`). No additional space is used regardless of the size of `s` or `t`.

### 🏁 Conclusion

This solution efficiently checks whether string `s` is a subsequence of string `t` using the two-pointer technique. It runs in **O(n)** time where `n` is the length of `t` and uses **O(1)** space, making it highly efficient and scalable even for large input sizes.

### 🎯 Key Takeaways:
- **Optimal Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in linear time, **O(n)**, making it suitable for large strings.
- **Constant Space**: The space complexity is constant (**O(1)**), which ensures minimal memory usage.
- **Simple Logic**: The two-pointer approach is intuitive and efficient for solving the subsequence problem.
