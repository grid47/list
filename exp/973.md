### Problem Statement
Given an array of points `pts` where each point is represented as a vector of two integers (x, y), and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin (0, 0).

### Approach
1. **Custom Comparator**:
   - Define a comparator class `cmp` to compare points based on their squared distance from the origin. This avoids unnecessary floating-point calculations.
   - The comparator compares two points by calculating the sum of squares of their coordinates.

2. **Priority Queue**:
   - Use a priority queue (min-heap) to store points. The points will be sorted based on their distance from the origin.
   - Push all points from `pts` into the priority queue.

3. **Extracting Closest Points**:
   - Initialize an empty vector `ans` to store the `k` closest points.
   - Pop the top `k` elements from the priority queue and add them to `ans`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - After extracting `k` closest points, return the `ans` vector.

### Code Walk-through
1. **`cmp` Class**:
   - Implements the `operator()` to compare the squared distances of two points.

2. **`kClosest` Method**:
   - Initializes the priority queue and pushes all points into it.
   - Extracts the top `k` points from the priority queue and stores them in the result vector.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of points, due to the insertion of points into the priority queue.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing points in the priority queue.
