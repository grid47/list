### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, partition it such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning.

### Approach
1. **Backtracking**:
   - Use a backtracking function (`bt`) to explore all possible partitions of the string.
   - For each index, iterate through the string to find potential palindrome substrings.
   - If a valid palindrome substring is found, add it to the current partition and recursively continue to find further partitions.

2. **Palindrome Checking**:
   - A helper function (`isPal`) checks if a substring defined by indices `i` and `j` is a palindrome.

### Code Walk-through
- **`partition` function**:
  - **Line 3**: Initializes a 2D vector `ans` to store all the valid partitions.
  - **Line 4**: A temporary vector `tmp` is created to hold the current partition being formed.
  - **Line 5**: Calls the backtracking function starting from index 0.

- **`bt` function**:
  - **Line 8**: If the current index `idx` equals the size of `s`, it means a valid partition has been formed, and it is added to `ans`.
  - **Line 10**: Loop through the string from `idx` to the end.
  - **Line 11**: If the substring from `idx` to `i` is a palindrome:
    - Add the palindrome substring to `tmp`.
    - Recur with the next index (`i + 1`).
    - Backtrack by removing the last added substring.

- **`isPal` function**:
  - **Line 21**: Checks if the substring between indices `i` and `j` is a palindrome.
  - **Line 23-26**: If characters at `i` and `j` are the same, continue inward; otherwise, return false.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(2^N)\) in the worst case for \(N\) being the length of the string, since each character can either be included in a partition or not.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for the recursion stack, plus space to store the partitions in `ans`.
