### üåü **Palindrome Partitioning Problem: Breaking Down the String into Palindromes**

The "Palindrome Partitioning" problem is an interesting challenge where we need to split a given string into several substrings such that each substring is a palindrome. This problem is a perfect example of how we can use **backtracking** to explore all possible ways of partitioning a string and check if each substring is a palindrome.

#### **Problem Statement**

We are given a string, and our goal is to find all possible ways to partition the string such that each part is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. For example, for the string `"aab"`, the possible palindrome partitions are:
```
[["a", "a", "b"], ["aa", "b"]]
```

### üí° **Approach: Backtracking to Find Palindrome Partitions**

To solve this problem efficiently, we will use a **backtracking** approach. The idea is to explore each possible substring and check if it forms a palindrome. If it does, we will add it to the current partition and continue exploring. Once we reach the end of the string, we will have found a valid partition.

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Backtracking**:
   - We will use a backtracking function to try different partitions of the string.
   - At each step, we explore all possible end indices for substrings starting from a given position.
   - If a substring is a palindrome, we recursively continue with the next part of the string.

2. **Palindrome Checking**:
   - To check if a substring is a palindrome, we compare characters at both ends and move toward the center. If all characters match, the substring is a palindrome.

### üßë‚Äçüíª **Code Breakdown**

#### Step 1: **Main Function**
```cpp
vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {
    vector<vector<string>> ans;
    vector<string> tmp;
    bt(ans, tmp, s, 0);
    return ans;
}
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `s`: The input string.
- **Variables**:
  - `ans`: A 2D vector to store all valid palindrome partitions.
  - `tmp`: A temporary vector that stores the current partition being formed during backtracking.
- **Logic**:
  - We call the backtracking function `bt` to start exploring all possible palindrome partitions.
  - The function will eventually populate the `ans` vector with all valid partitions.

#### Step 2: **Backtracking Function**
```cpp
void bt(vector<vector<string>> &ans, vector<string> &tmp, string s, int idx) {
    if(idx == s.size()) {
        ans.push_back(tmp);
        return;
    }
    
    for(int i = idx; i < s.size(); i++) {
        if(isPal(s, idx, i)) {
            tmp.push_back(s.substr(idx, i - idx + 1));
            bt(ans, tmp, s, i + 1);
            tmp.pop_back();
        }
    }
}
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `ans`: The 2D vector to store the final palindrome partitions.
  - `tmp`: The current partition being formed.
  - `s`: The input string.
  - `idx`: The starting index for the next potential palindrome substring.
- **Base Case**:
  - If `idx == s.size()`, it means we have processed the entire string. The current partition `tmp` is valid, so we add it to `ans`.
- **Recursive Step**:
  - For each position `i` from `idx` to `s.size()`, check if the substring from `idx` to `i` is a palindrome.
  - If it is, we add it to `tmp`, recursively call the backtracking function to continue with the rest of the string, and backtrack by removing the last palindrome substring.

#### Step 3: **Palindrome Checking Function**
```cpp
bool isPal(string s, int i, int j) {
    while(i <= j) {
        if(s[i] != s[j])
            return false;
        i++, j--;
    }
    return true;
}
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `s`: The string to check.
  - `i`: The starting index of the substring.
  - `j`: The ending index of the substring.
- **Logic**:
  - The function checks if the substring from `i` to `j` is a palindrome.
  - It compares characters at both ends of the substring. If they match, it moves towards the center. If any mismatch is found, it returns `false`. If the entire substring is checked without mismatches, it returns `true`.

### üöÄ **Time and Space Complexity**

#### Time Complexity:
- **Backtracking**: The number of possible partitions grows exponentially. For a string of length `n`, there are about `2^(n-1)` possible ways to partition it.
- **Palindrome Checking**: For each substring, we check if it's a palindrome, which takes `O(k)` time, where `k` is the length of the substring. In the worst case, we check every possible substring, which could take `O(n^2)` time.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: The time complexity is `O(2^n * n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. The exponential factor comes from generating all possible partitions, and the polynomial factor comes from palindrome checking.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Recursive Stack**: The recursive call stack can have a maximum depth of `n` (one call per substring), leading to a space complexity of `O(n)`.
- **Storage for Result**: The result `ans` stores all valid palindrome partitions. In the worst case, the number of partitions could be `O(2^n)`.
- **Overall Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(n^2)` due to the result storage and the recursive stack.

### üèÅ **Conclusion**

The solution effectively solves the "Palindrome Partitioning" problem using **backtracking** to generate all valid partitions and checking if each substring is a palindrome. While the solution works efficiently for smaller strings, it may not be suitable for very large strings due to the exponential growth in the number of partitions.

This approach not only gives us all possible palindromic partitions but also does so in a manner that ensures we explore all potential partitions incrementally, pruning non-palindromic substrings early. It‚Äôs a great solution for this problem, and the backtracking approach allows for clear, understandable code.

Keep practicing this problem-solving technique, and soon you‚Äôll be able to apply backtracking confidently to a variety of other challenges! Keep up the great work! üéâ‚ú®
