### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find all possible **palindrome partitioning** of a given string. The goal is to divide the string into several substrings such that each substring is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. 

For example, given the string `"aab"`, the possible palindrome partitions are:
```
[["a", "a", "b"], ["aa", "b"]]
```

### Approach

To solve the problem of finding all possible palindrome partitions, we can use a **backtracking** approach. This involves exploring each possible way of splitting the string and checking whether the substrings formed during the split are palindromes. If a substring is a palindrome, we add it to the current partition and proceed with the next part of the string.

#### Key Ideas:

1. **Backtracking**:
   - We start with an empty list to store the current partition of palindromes.
   - For each starting index of the string, we iterate over the end indices, and for each substring, we check if it's a palindrome.
   - If it is a palindrome, we add it to the current partition and move to the next part of the string. When we reach the end of the string, the current partition is valid and can be added to the result.

2. **Palindrome Checking**:
   - To check whether a given substring is a palindrome, we use a helper function that compares the characters at both ends and moves towards the center.
   - If all characters match, the substring is a palindrome.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: **Main Function**
```cpp
vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {
    vector<vector<string>> ans;
    vector<string> tmp;
    bt(ans, tmp, s, 0);
    return ans;
}
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `s`: The input string.
- **Variables**:
  - `ans`: A 2D vector to store all possible palindrome partitions.
  - `tmp`: A temporary vector to store the current partition while backtracking.
- **Logic**:
  - We call the helper function `bt` (backtracking) with the initial parameters to start the process of finding palindrome partitions.
  - After the backtracking is complete, the `ans` vector contains all valid palindrome partitions, which is returned as the result.

#### Step 2: **Backtracking Function**
```cpp
void bt(vector<vector<string>> &ans, vector<string> &tmp, string s, int idx) {
    if(idx == s.size()) {
        ans.push_back(tmp);
        return;
    }
    
    for(int i = idx; i < s.size(); i++) {
        if(isPal(s, idx, i)) {
            tmp.push_back(s.substr(idx, i - idx + 1));
            bt(ans, tmp, s, i + 1);
            tmp.pop_back();
        }
    }
}
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `ans`: The 2D vector to store the final palindrome partitions.
  - `tmp`: The current partition being formed.
  - `s`: The input string.
  - `idx`: The current starting index for the next potential palindrome substring.
- **Base Case**:
  - If `idx == s.size()`, it means we have explored all characters of the string. The current partition `tmp` is added to the result.
- **Recursive Step**:
  - For each position `i` from `idx` to `s.size()`, check if the substring from `idx` to `i` is a palindrome.
  - If it is a palindrome, add it to `tmp` and recursively continue with the next part of the string by calling `bt` with `i + 1` as the new starting index.
  - After the recursive call, remove the last palindrome substring (backtrack) to try the next possibility.

#### Step 3: **Palindrome Checking Function**
```cpp
bool isPal(string s, int i, int j) {
    while(i <= j) {
        if(s[i] != s[j])
            return false;
        i++, j--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `s`: The string to check.
  - `i`: The starting index of the substring.
  - `j`: The ending index of the substring.
- **Logic**:
  - The function checks if the substring from index `i` to `j` is a palindrome.
  - It compares the characters at `s[i]` and `s[j]`. If they are equal, it moves towards the center by incrementing `i` and decrementing `j`. If any mismatch is found, it returns `false`. If the entire substring is checked without mismatches, it returns `true`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

- **Backtracking**: The backtracking function generates all possible partitions of the string, which can be exponential in nature. For a string of length `n`, the number of possible partitions is approximately `2^(n-1)`, as each character can either be included in the current partition or start a new partition.
- **Palindrome Checking**: For each substring, we check if it is a palindrome, which takes `O(k)` time, where `k` is the length of the substring. In the worst case, we check every possible substring, which could take up to `O(n^2)` checks for all substrings.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity is approximately `O(2^n * n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. The exponential factor comes from generating all possible partitions, and the polynomial factor comes from the palindrome checks.

#### Space Complexity:

- **Recursive Stack**: The depth of the recursive call stack is at most `n`, as each recursive call explores a new partition.
- **Storage for Result**: The `ans` vector stores all valid palindrome partitions, and the size of `ans` depends on the number of partitions generated, which in the worst case can be `O(2^n)`.
- **Overall Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(n^2)` due to the space needed for the `ans` vector and the recursive stack.

### Conclusion

This solution leverages a **backtracking** approach to generate all possible partitions of the string, checking whether each substring is a palindrome. The solution is efficient for relatively small strings, but due to its exponential nature, it may not be suitable for very large strings. The key idea is to build partitions incrementally and prune non-palindromic substrings early, making the approach both elegant and functional for moderate input sizes. By using a recursive backtracking approach combined with palindrome checks, the solution ensures that we explore all valid partitions efficiently while maintaining simplicity and clarity in the code.
