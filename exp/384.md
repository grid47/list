### Problem Statement
Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:
1. **Reset**: Restore the array to its original configuration.
2. **Shuffle**: Randomly shuffle the array and return the shuffled configuration.

### Approach
To implement this functionality, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Store the original array in a class member variable upon instantiation.

2. **Reset Function**:
   - Return the original array stored in the class.

3. **Shuffle Function**:
   - Create a copy of the original array to perform shuffling.
   - Use the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm (or Knuth shuffle) to randomly permute the array:
     - Iterate through the array from the first element to the last.
     - For each element, select a random index from the unshuffled portion of the array and swap the current element with the element at that random index.

### Code Walk-through
- The `Solution` class contains:
  - A constructor that initializes `arr` with the provided `nums` array.
  - The `reset` method, which returns the original array.
  - The `shuffle` method, which randomly shuffles the array using the Fisher-Yates algorithm.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - `reset`: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array (returning a copy of the original).
  - `shuffle`: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array (iterating through the array to shuffle).
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - `reset`: O(n) for the array copy.
  - `shuffle`: O(n) for the array copy used for shuffling.
