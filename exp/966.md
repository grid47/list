## Problem Statement
Given a list of words (`wordlist`) and a list of `queries`, implement a spell checker that:
1. Returns words from the wordlist if they exactly match a query.
2. Ignores case and returns the first matching word from `wordlist` if only capitalization differs.
3. Ignores vowels (treating all vowels as the same) and returns the first matching word if only vowel differences exist.
4. Returns an empty string if no match is found.

## Approach
1. **Exact Match**: Use an `unordered_set` `words` to store all words in `wordlist`, allowing O(1) lookup for exact matches.
2. **Case-Insensitive Match**: Use an `unordered_map` `cap` to map lowercase versions of `wordlist` words to their original forms. This handles case-insensitive matches.
3. **Vowel-Ignoring Match**: Use an `unordered_map` `vowel` where vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`) are replaced with `#` in each word from `wordlist`. This enables matching words that only differ by vowels.

### Helper Functions
- **`tolow(string w)`**: Converts a string to lowercase.
- **`todev(string w)`**: Converts a string to lowercase and replaces vowels with `#` to create a "devoweled" form.

### Spell Checker Logic
- For each query:
  1. If there is an exact match in `words`, continue (no change to query).
  2. Otherwise, check for a case-insensitive match using `cap`. If found, replace the query with the matched word.
  3. If no case-insensitive match is found, check for a devoweled match in `vowel`.
  4. If no match is found, replace the query with an empty string.

## Code Walk-through
- The `spellchecker` function takes `wordlist` and `queries` as inputs.
- **Data Structures**:
  - `words` set for exact matches.
  - `cap` map for case-insensitive matches.
  - `vowel` map for vowel-agnostic matches.
- For each query, the function:
  - Checks for an exact match.
  - If not found, checks for a lowercase match in `cap`.
  - If still not found, checks for a devoweled match in `vowel`.
  - If no match is found in any of the three checks, sets the query to an empty string.
- **Helper Functions**:
  - `tolow` converts a word to lowercase.
  - `todev` converts a word to lowercase and replaces vowels with `#`.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `wordlist` and `m` is the length of `queries`. Each query requires constant-time lookups in the set and maps.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the storage required for `words`, `cap`, and `vowel` mappings.
