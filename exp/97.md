### Problem Statement
Given three strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, determine if `s3` can be formed by an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`. Interleaving means maintaining the relative order of characters in `s1` and `s2`.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
   - Define a recursive function `dp(i, j)` to check if the substring of `s3` up to `i + j` can be formed using the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2`.
   - **Base Case**: If `i` and `j` reach the end of `s1` and `s2`, return `true`.
   - **Memoization**: Store results in a `memo` table to avoid redundant calculations.
2. **Recursive Cases**:
   - For each position `(i, j)` in `s1` and `s2`:
     - If the character `s1[i]` matches `s3[i + j]`, recursively call `dp(i + 1, j)`.
     - If `s2[j]` matches `s3[i + j]`, recursively call `dp(i, j + 1)`.
   - Use bitwise OR (`|`) to combine results as any valid path should return `true`.
3. **Edge Case Check**:
   - If `s1.size() + s2.size()` is not equal to `s3.size()`, return `false` immediately as interleaving is impossible.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialize Variables**: Set `s1`, `s2`, `s3` as class variables for easy access.
2. **Edge Case**: Check if lengths match.
3. **Memoization Table**: Initialize `memo` with `-1` for unchecked cells.
4. **Recursive DP Calls**: Start with `dp(0, 0)` and recursively check all possible interleavings.
5. **Return Result**: The result of `dp(0, 0)` indicates if `s3` can be formed by interleaving `s1` and `s2`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \times m)\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, due to memoization reducing redundant calls.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n \times m)\), for the `memo` table.
