### Problem Statement

The problem asks if a given string `s3` is formed by the interleaving of two strings `s1` and `s2`. Specifically, you are given three strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`. Your task is to determine if `s3` is a valid interleaving of `s1` and `s2`. An interleaving of two strings means that the characters of both strings appear in `s3` in the same relative order as they appear in the original strings.

For example:
- Given `s1 = "abc"`, `s2 = "def"`, and `s3 = "adbcef"`, the result is `true` because the string `s3` can be formed by interleaving `s1` and `s2`.
- However, if `s3 = "abdecf"`, the result is `false` because the relative order of characters in `s1` and `s2` is violated.

### Approach

The problem is a classic example of **dynamic programming**. The idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems, each of which determines whether a substring of `s3` can be formed by interleaving substrings of `s1` and `s2`.

The dynamic programming approach follows these steps:
1. **Check Base Case**: If the combined length of `s1` and `s2` does not match the length of `s3`, return `false`. This is because if the lengths don't match, it's impossible for `s3` to be an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.
2. **Memoization**: Use a memoization table (`memo`) to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations. The table tracks whether it's possible to interleave substrings of `s1` and `s2` to form substrings of `s3`.
3. **Recursive Function**: Define a recursive function `dp(i, j)` that checks if it's possible to form the substring `s3[i + j:]` from `s1[i:]` and `s2[j:]`. The recursion proceeds by checking two possibilities:
   - If the character at `s1[i]` matches `s3[i + j]`, try to form the remainder of `s3` by advancing the index `i`.
   - If the character at `s2[j]` matches `s3[i + j]`, try to form the remainder of `s3` by advancing the index `j`.
4. **Final Check**: The recursion starts at the beginning of both strings (`i = 0, j = 0`) and the final result is stored in `memo[0][0]`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. Class Definition and Initialization

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string s1, s2, s3;
    vector<vector<int>> memo;
```

- `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` are the strings provided for checking interleaving.
- `memo` is a 2D table used for memoization to store intermediate results. Each entry `memo[i][j]` will hold the result of whether it's possible to interleave `s1[i:]` and `s2[j:]` to form `s3[i + j:]`.

#### 2. Recursive Function (`dp`)

```cpp
bool dp(int i, int j) {
    if (i == s1.size() && j == s2.size()) return true;
    
    if (memo[i][j] != -1) return memo[i][j];
    int ans = 0;
    int k = i + j;
    if (i < s1.size() && s1[i] == s3[k])
        ans |= dp(i + 1, j);
    
    if (j < s2.size() && s2[j] == s3[k])
        ans |= dp(i, j + 1);
    
    return memo[i][j] = ans;
}
```

- **Base Case**: If both `i == s1.size()` and `j == s2.size()`, it means both strings have been completely used, and we've formed `s3` completely, so return `true`.
- **Memoization Check**: If `memo[i][j]` is not `-1`, it means we've already computed this subproblem, so we return its result.
- **Recursive Case**: We check two possibilities:
  - If the character at `s1[i]` matches `s3[k]`, we move to the next index in `s1` and continue checking.
  - If the character at `s2[j]` matches `s3[k]`, we move to the next index in `s2` and continue checking.
- **Return Memoized Result**: The result of the current subproblem is stored in `memo[i][j]` to avoid redundant calculations.

#### 3. Main Function (`isInterleave`)

```cpp
bool isInterleave(string s1, string s2, string s3) {
    this->s1 = s1;
    this->s2 = s2;
    this->s3 = s3;
    if (s1.size() + s2.size() != s3.size()) return false;
    memo.resize(s1.size() + 1, vector<int>(s2.size() + 1, -1));
    return dp(0, 0);
}
```

- **Base Length Check**: Before proceeding with the recursion, we check if the sum of the lengths of `s1` and `s2` is equal to the length of `s3`. If they don't match, return `false` because itâ€™s impossible for `s3` to be an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.
- **Memoization Table Initialization**: The `memo` table is resized to fit the dimensions `(s1.size() + 1)` and `(s2.size() + 1)` with all entries initialized to `-1` to indicate that no subproblem has been solved yet.
- **Start Recursion**: The recursion starts with `dp(0, 0)`, which checks if it's possible to form the interleaving from the beginning of both strings.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the length of `s1` and `n` is the length of `s2`. This is because we solve each subproblem once, and the total number of subproblems is proportional to the product of the lengths of `s1` and `s2`.

#### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the length of `s1` and `n` is the length of `s2`. This is due to the memoization table storing results for each subproblem.

### Conclusion

The solution to this problem efficiently checks if a given string `s3` is an interleaving of two strings `s1` and `s2` using a **dynamic programming** approach with **memoization**. By recursively checking possible interleavings of substrings and storing the results to avoid redundant calculations, the solution ensures optimal performance. The use of a 2D memoization table allows the problem to be solved in **O(m * n)** time, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input strings `s1` and `s2`. This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient for this type of problem.
