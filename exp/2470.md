### Problem Statement:
The task is to find the number of subarrays in a given integer array where the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the elements in each subarray is equal to a specified value `k`. The goal is to identify all subarrays in which the LCM of their elements matches `k`.

### Approach:
To solve this problem, we need to examine all possible subarrays of the given array `nums` and compute the LCM for each subarray. If the LCM of the subarray is equal to `k`, we count that subarray as valid.

- **Subarrays**: A subarray is a contiguous portion of the array. For example, the subarrays of `[1, 2, 3]` are `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[1, 2]`, `[2, 3]`, and `[1, 2, 3]`.
  
- **LCM**: The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the numbers. The LCM can be calculated using the relationship between LCM and GCD (Greatest Common Divisor):
  \[
  LCM(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{GCD(a, b)}
  \]
  
- **Solution**: We will iterate over all possible subarrays in the array `nums` and compute the LCM of the elements in each subarray. For each subarray, if the LCM is equal to `k`, we increment the count. To make this more efficient:
  - We check if the current number in the subarray divides `k` (i.e., `k % nums[j] == 0`).
  - We update the LCM progressively for each new element added to the subarray using the formula mentioned above.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step):
Now let’s break down the code step by step to understand the process in detail:

1. **Function Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   int subarrayLCM(vector<int>& nums, int k)
   ```
   This function, `subarrayLCM`, takes two parameters:
   - `nums`: A vector of integers representing the array for which we are to find subarrays with LCM equal to `k`.
   - `k`: An integer representing the target value for the LCM of subarrays.
   
   The function returns an integer representing the count of subarrays where the LCM of the elements equals `k`.

2. **Initializations**:
   ```cpp
   int n = nums.size(), cnt = 0;
   ```
   - `n` stores the size of the `nums` array, which will be used to determine the bounds for the loops.
   - `cnt` is initialized to zero and will be used to store the count of subarrays whose LCM equals `k`.

3. **Outer Loop (Iterating Over Subarrays)**:
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
   ```
   The outer loop iterates over each element of the array `nums`. Each iteration starts a new subarray from index `i`. The goal is to consider all subarrays starting at index `i`.

4. **Inner Loop (Expanding Subarrays)**:
   ```cpp
   for (int j = i; j < n && k % nums[j] == 0; j++) {
   ```
   The inner loop iterates over the elements starting from the `i`th index. For each element `nums[j]`, the condition `k % nums[j] == 0` ensures that we only consider subarrays where the current element `nums[j]` divides `k`. If this condition is not met, we stop expanding the subarray because further elements will not produce a valid subarray with an LCM that could equal `k`.

5. **Updating the LCM of the Current Subarray**:
   ```cpp
   nums[i] = (nums[i] * nums[j] / __gcd(nums[i], nums[j]));
   ```
   - We calculate the new LCM of the current subarray by updating `nums[i]`. 
   - This is done by taking the product of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` and dividing it by their greatest common divisor (`GCD`), which is computed using the `__gcd` function provided by C++.
   
   This formula ensures that `nums[i]` holds the LCM of the subarray starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`.

6. **Checking if the LCM Equals `k`**:
   ```cpp
   cnt += nums[i] == k;
   ```
   After updating the LCM of the current subarray, we check if it is equal to `k`. If it is, we increment the count `cnt` by 1.

7. **Return the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return cnt;
   ```
   After both loops have completed, the function returns the total count of subarrays whose LCM equals `k`.

### Complexity:
Let’s analyze the time complexity and space complexity of this solution:

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The outer loop runs for each index `i` in the array `nums`. Hence, it iterates `n` times.
  - The inner loop iterates for each element `nums[j]` starting from index `i`. In the worst case, this can go up to `n` iterations for each `i`.
  - Inside the inner loop, calculating the LCM involves computing the GCD, which is done in \( O(\log \min(a, b)) \) time for two numbers `a` and `b`. Since the GCD operation is quite efficient, the overall complexity for the GCD operation can be considered constant in practice for typical integer sizes.

  Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is \( O(n^2) \), because for each `i`, we may iterate over all subsequent elements `j`, leading to a quadratic number of subarrays being considered.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \( O(1) \) if we disregard the input and output space. We only use a few integer variables (`n` and `cnt`), and the space for storing the LCM is reused in place in the `nums` vector.

### Conclusion:
The `subarrayLCM` function is designed to efficiently count subarrays of the given array `nums` whose LCM is equal to the target value `k`. The solution works by iterating over all subarrays, updating the LCM progressively, and checking if the LCM equals `k`. The solution leverages the GCD to calculate the LCM and ensures that only valid subarrays are considered by checking divisibility by `k`.

While the algorithm has a time complexity of \( O(n^2) \), it performs efficiently for smaller arrays, as each GCD operation is relatively fast. The solution also uses constant space, making it space-efficient. This approach is well-suited for moderately sized arrays and target values where the quadratic time complexity is manageable. 

Overall, this solution is clear and effective, offering an optimal approach for solving the problem of counting subarrays with a specific LCM.
