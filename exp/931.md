### Problem Statement
Given a square matrix `mtx` of size `m x n`, the goal is to find the minimum sum of a falling path from the top to the bottom of the matrix. A falling path can start from any element in the first row and chooses one element from each row. The next row's choice must be from the same column or adjacent columns.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - The problem can be solved using dynamic programming, where each element in the matrix is updated to represent the minimum sum of falling paths that end at that element.
   - The update rule is based on the values of the previous row.

2. **Iterate Through the Matrix**:
   - Start from the second row and iterate through each element.
   - For each element `mtx[i][j]`, calculate the minimum sum from the previous row (`i-1`).
   - The potential contributors are the directly above element, and the adjacent elements to the left and right. The indices are carefully bounded to prevent out-of-bounds access.

3. **Final Result**:
   - The minimum value in the last row of the updated matrix gives the result.

### Code Walk-through
- The outer loop iterates through each row starting from the second row.
- The inner loop iterates through each column, updating the current cell with the minimum sum possible from the previous row.
- Finally, a linear scan through the last row identifies the minimum falling path sum.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix, since we traverse each element once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are modifying the matrix in place without using additional data structures.
