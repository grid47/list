### üåü Problem Statement

In this problem, we need to design and implement a **Trie** (also known as a **prefix tree**), which is a powerful data structure used for efficiently storing and searching strings. A Trie allows for fast insertions, lookups, and prefix matching, making it ideal for tasks like autocomplete and dictionary-based operations.

The operations that need to be implemented are:
1. **Insert:** Insert a word into the Trie.
2. **Search:** Check if a specific word exists in the Trie.
3. **StartsWith:** Check if any word in the Trie starts with a given prefix.

### üß† Approach

The Trie works by breaking down each word into characters and storing them in a tree structure. Each node represents a character, and paths from the root to leaf nodes represent the words or prefixes in the Trie. The beauty of a Trie is that strings with common prefixes share nodes, which leads to memory optimization.

The implementation will include three main operations:
- **Insert:** Add a word to the Trie by inserting each character one by one.
- **Search:** Traverse the Trie based on the word's characters and check if the word exists.
- **StartsWith:** Check if a prefix exists in the Trie by traversing through the Trie based on the prefix‚Äôs characters.

Each node will have:
- A vector `chd[]` for the 26 possible characters (for lowercase English letters).
- A boolean `isWord` to mark if the node represents the end of a valid word.

### üî® Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

#### 1. **Node Class Definition**
```cpp
class Node {
public:
    vector<Node*> chd;
    bool isWord;
    Node(int n) {
        chd.resize(n, 0);
        isWord = false;
    }
};
```
- **Node Class:** Represents each character in the Trie. It has:
  - **`chd[]`:** A vector holding child nodes. There are 26 possible child nodes (one for each lowercase English letter).
  - **`isWord`:** Marks whether the current node is the last character of a word.
  - **Constructor:** Initializes the `chd` vector and sets `isWord` to `false`.

#### 2. **Trie Class Definition**
```cpp
class Trie {
public:
    Node* root;
    Trie() {
        root = new Node(26);
    }
```
- **Root Node:** The `root` is the starting point of the Trie, initialized with a `Node` that supports 26 children (for each letter of the alphabet).

#### 3. **Insert Function**
```cpp
void insert(string word) {
    Node* node = root;
    for(int i = 0; i < word.size(); i++) {
        if(node->chd[word[i] - 'a'] == NULL)
            node->chd[word[i] - 'a'] = new Node(26);
        node = node->chd[word[i] - 'a'];
    }
    node->isWord = true;
}
```
- **Insert Operation:** Adds a word to the Trie:
  - Traverse each character in the word.
  - If the corresponding child node doesn‚Äôt exist, create a new one.
  - Move to the next character and repeat.
  - Finally, mark the last node as the end of a word.

#### 4. **Search Function**
```cpp
bool search(string word) {
    Node* node = root;
    for(int i = 0; i < word.size(); i++) {
        if(node->chd[word[i] - 'a'] == NULL)
            return false;
        node = node->chd[word[i] - 'a'];
    }
    return node->isWord;        
}
```
- **Search Operation:** Checks if a word exists:
  - Traverse the Trie based on the characters of the word.
  - If a character is missing in the Trie (child node is `NULL`), return `false`.
  - If we reach the last character and it‚Äôs marked as the end of a word, return `true`.

#### 5. **StartsWith Function**
```cpp
bool startsWith(string word) {
    Node* node = root;
    for(int i = 0; i < word.size(); i++) {
        if(node->chd[word[i] - 'a'] == NULL)
            return false;
        node = node->chd[word[i] - 'a'];
    }
    return true;        
}
```
- **Prefix Matching:** Checks if a prefix exists:
  - Traverse the Trie based on the characters of the prefix.
  - If at any point the character doesn‚Äôt exist, return `false`.
  - If the entire prefix is found, return `true`.

### üìà Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **Insert Operation:** Each insertion involves traversing the Trie for each character in the word. Thus, the time complexity for **insert** is **O(L)**, where `L` is the length of the word.
- **Search Operation:** Searching for a word also involves traversing each character, so the time complexity for **search** is **O(L)**.
- **StartsWith Operation:** Like the search function, the time complexity for **startsWith** is **O(L)**, where `L` is the length of the prefix.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity:** The space required is **O(N)**, where `N` is the total number of nodes created. Since each node has an array of 26 child nodes, the space depends on the number of nodes and the depth of the Trie.

### üèÅ Conclusion

The Trie is a highly efficient data structure for managing strings, allowing fast insertion, search, and prefix matching. By storing common prefixes only once, it optimizes space usage while providing fast access to words and prefixes.

With the **Insert**, **Search**, and **StartsWith** operations all running in **O(L)** time, where `L` is the length of the string or prefix, this structure is well-suited for tasks like autocompletion, spell-checking, and dictionary lookups. 

The **Trie** class we‚Äôve implemented can handle large datasets efficiently, making it an invaluable tool for many applications where fast string lookup is needed! üåü
