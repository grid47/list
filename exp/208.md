### Problem Statement
Implement a Trie (prefix tree) with the following methods:
- `insert(word)`: Inserts a word into the trie.
- `search(word)`: Returns true if the word is in the trie.
- `startsWith(prefix)`: Returns true if there is any word in the trie that starts with the given prefix.

### Approach
1. **Node Structure**:
   - Create a `Node` class that contains:
     - A vector of child nodes (`chd`) representing each character's children.
     - A boolean flag (`isWord`) to indicate if the node represents the end of a valid word.

2. **Trie Structure**:
   - Create a `Trie` class that contains:
     - A pointer to the root node of the trie.

3. **Insertion**:
   - Traverse each character of the word:
     - If the child node for the character does not exist, create a new node.
     - Move to the child node and continue until the word is fully inserted.
   - Set the `isWord` flag to true for the last character node.

4. **Searching**:
   - Traverse the trie according to the characters of the word.
   - If a character node does not exist, return false.
   - If all characters exist, return the `isWord` flag of the last character node.

5. **Prefix Check**:
   - Similar to the search method, but return true if all characters are found, regardless of the `isWord` flag.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the `Node` class.
- **Lines 3-8**: Initialize the `Node` class with a vector of child nodes and a boolean flag.
- **Line 10**: Define the `Trie` class.
- **Lines 12-14**: Initialize the `Trie` with a root node.
- **Lines 16-28**: Define the `insert` method to add a word to the trie.
- **Lines 30-41**: Define the `search` method to check for the existence of a word.
- **Lines 43-54**: Define the `startsWith` method to check for the existence of a prefix.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - `insert`: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of the word being inserted.
  - `search`: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of the word being searched.
  - `startsWith`: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of the prefix being checked.
  
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - \(O(n \cdot m)\), where \(n\) is the number of words and \(m\) is the average length of the words stored in the trie, due to the storage of the nodes.
