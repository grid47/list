### Problem Statement

The problem is to design and implement a data structure called **Trie** (or prefix tree) for storing and searching strings efficiently. A Trie is a specialized tree-like structure used to store associative data, where keys are usually strings. It supports operations like insertion, search, and prefix matching. The operations should be performed in an optimal way, allowing for fast searches, insertions, and prefix lookups.

In this problem, we are tasked with implementing the following operations:
1. **Insert**: Insert a word into the Trie.
2. **Search**: Check whether a word exists in the Trie.
3. **StartsWith**: Check whether there exists a word in the Trie that starts with a given prefix.

These operations are expected to be efficient in terms of both time and space, which can be achieved using a Trie data structure.

### Approach

The Trie operates by storing characters of strings in a tree-like structure. Each node in the tree represents a character, and the paths from the root to the leaf nodes represent words or prefixes in the Trie. The primary idea behind the Trie is that strings with common prefixes will share common nodes, which results in significant space optimization.

We will implement three main functions:
1. **Insert:** Insert each character of the word into the Trie, creating new nodes as necessary.
2. **Search:** Traverse the Trie using the characters of the word and check if the word exists.
3. **StartsWith:** Similar to search, but only ensures that the prefix exists without requiring the node to mark the end of a word.

In the Trie implementation, each node will have:
- A vector of child pointers `chd[]` representing links to the next character nodes.
- A boolean `isWord` to mark whether a node represents the end of a valid word.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. **Node Class Definition**
```cpp
class Node {
public:
    vector<Node*> chd;
    bool isWord;
    Node(int n) {
        chd.resize(n, 0);
        isWord = false;
    }
};
```
- **Node Class:** Each node represents a character in the Trie. It has:
  - **`chd[]`:** A vector of pointers to child nodes. Each child corresponds to a character, and since we are dealing with lowercase English letters, the size of the vector is 26 (corresponding to the 26 letters from 'a' to 'z').
  - **`isWord`:** A boolean that marks whether the current node represents the end of a word. It is set to `true` when a word ends at that node.
  - **Constructor:** The constructor initializes the `chd` vector to contain 26 null pointers (for each letter), and `isWord` is set to `false` initially.

#### 2. **Trie Class Definition**
```cpp
class Trie {
public:
    Node* root;
    Trie() {
        root = new Node(26);
    }
```
- **Root Node:** The Trie class contains a root node, which is a starting point for all operations. The `root` is initialized with a `Node` of size 26, which corresponds to the 26 lowercase English letters.
- **Constructor:** The constructor initializes the Trie by creating a root node.

#### 3. **Insert Function**
```cpp
void insert(string word) {
    Node* node = root;
    for(int i = 0; i < word.size(); i++) {
        if(node->chd[word[i] - 'a'] == NULL)
            node->chd[word[i] - 'a'] = new Node(26);
        node = node->chd[word[i] - 'a'];
    }
    node->isWord = true;
}
```
- **Insert Operation:** The `insert` function takes a word and inserts it into the Trie:
  1. Start from the root node.
  2. For each character in the word, check if the corresponding child node exists. If not, create a new node for that character.
  3. Move to the child node corresponding to the current character.
  4. After inserting all characters, mark the last node (the node corresponding to the last character of the word) with `isWord = true`, indicating the end of a valid word.

#### 4. **Search Function**
```cpp
bool search(string word) {
    Node* node = root;
    for(int i = 0; i < word.size(); i++) {
        if(node->chd[word[i] - 'a'] == NULL)
            return false;
        node = node->chd[word[i] - 'a'];
    }
    return node->isWord;        
}
```
- **Search Operation:** The `search` function checks if a word exists in the Trie:
  1. Start from the root node.
  2. For each character in the word, move to the corresponding child node. If a character is not found (i.e., if the child node is `NULL`), return `false` immediately.
  3. Once all characters have been traversed, check if the last node is marked as `isWord`. If it is, the word exists in the Trie, and the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

#### 5. **StartsWith Function**
```cpp
bool startsWith(string word) {
    Node* node = root;
    for(int i = 0; i < word.size(); i++) {
        if(node->chd[word[i] - 'a'] == NULL)
            return false;
        node = node->chd[word[i] - 'a'];
    }
    return true;        
}
```
- **Prefix Matching:** The `startsWith` function checks if any word in the Trie starts with the given prefix:
  1. Similar to the search function, traverse through the characters of the prefix.
  2. If at any point, the corresponding child node does not exist (`NULL`), return `false`.
  3. If the entire prefix is found in the Trie, return `true`, indicating that there exists a word that starts with this prefix.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **Insert Operation:** 
  - For each character in the word, we traverse through the Trie and create nodes as necessary. The time complexity is **O(L)**, where `L` is the length of the word being inserted.
- **Search Operation:**
  - Similar to insertion, for each character in the word, we traverse the Trie. The time complexity is **O(L)**, where `L` is the length of the word being searched.
- **StartsWith Operation:**
  - The time complexity is also **O(L)**, as we traverse the Trie to check if the given prefix exists.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is **O(N)**, where `N` is the total number of nodes created in the Trie. Since each node contains an array of size 26 for the child nodes, the total space used depends on the number of nodes and the depth of the Trie.

### Conclusion

The Trie is an efficient data structure for string-based operations, such as insertion, search, and prefix matching. It significantly reduces the time complexity of these operations compared to a linear search approach. The key advantage of a Trie is its ability to share common prefixes between strings, making it space-efficient when handling large sets of strings with common prefixes.

The `Trie` class here supports three essential operations:
1. **Insert**: Adds a word to the Trie.
2. **Search**: Checks if a word exists in the Trie.
3. **StartsWith**: Checks if any word in the Trie starts with a given prefix.

By using a Trie, these operations can be performed in **O(L)** time, where `L` is the length of the word or prefix being processed. This makes the Trie a powerful and efficient data structure for applications like autocomplete, dictionary lookups, and pattern matching.
