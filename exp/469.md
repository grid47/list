### Problem Statement
You are given a function `rand7()` that generates a random integer from 1 to 7. Your task is to implement a function `rand10()` that generates a random integer from 1 to 10 using only `rand7()`.

### Approach
1. **Mapping 1-7 to a Larger Range**:
   - To generate numbers in the range 1 to 10, first, we create a range larger than 10 by using two calls to `rand7()`.
   - The expression `7 * (rand7() - 1) + (rand7() - 1)` generates a random number in the range [0, 48) (since \( 7 \times 6 + 6 = 48 \)). 

2. **Rejecting Out of Range Values**:
   - We only want values less than 40, which allows us to map them to the range [1, 10].
   - If the generated value is 40 or greater, we discard it and re-generate.

3. **Returning the Final Value**:
   - The final step involves returning the result mapped to the range 1 to 10 using `(result % 10) + 1`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `rand10()` initializes a variable `result` to a value outside the acceptable range (40) to enter the while loop.

2. **Generating a Valid Result**:
   - Inside the loop, the expression generates a new `result` until it falls below 40. If the value is valid, it computes the final number between 1 and 10.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) on average since the while loop will only need a few iterations on average due to the probabilistic nature of random number generation.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional data structures are used.
