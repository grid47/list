### Problem Statement

The problem asks to compute the **XOR beauty** of a given array of integers. The XOR beauty of an array is defined as the result of performing a bitwise XOR operation on all the elements in the array. More specifically:

- We are given an array of integers `nums`, and the task is to compute the XOR of all elements in the array and return the result.

In this task, we are simply required to apply the XOR operation to each number in the array in sequence and return the result.

### Approach

The XOR operation is a bitwise operation that has several important properties:
1. **Commutativity**: The order in which you apply XOR does not matter. For example:
   - `a ^ b ^ c == c ^ a ^ b`
2. **Associativity**: You can group the terms in any way:
   - `(a ^ b) ^ c == a ^ (b ^ c)`
3. **Identity**: XOR with 0 leaves the number unchanged:
   - `a ^ 0 == a`
4. **Self-Inverse**: XOR of a number with itself results in 0:
   - `a ^ a == 0`

In the context of the problem, to find the XOR beauty of the array, we iterate over the array and apply the XOR operation between all the elements.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. Function Definition

```cpp
int xorBeauty(vector<int>& nums) {
```

- The function `xorBeauty` is defined to take a vector of integers `nums` as input.
- The return type of the function is an integer, which will represent the result of the XOR operation on all elements of the array.

#### 2. Initialize a Temporary Variable

```cpp
int tmp = 0;
```

- We initialize an integer variable `tmp` to 0. This will store the result of the cumulative XOR operation as we iterate through the array.
- Initially, `tmp` is 0 because XORing any number with 0 leaves the number unchanged (i.e., `a ^ 0 = a`).

#### 3. XOR All Elements in the Array

```cpp
for(int it: nums)
    tmp ^= it;
```

- We loop through each element `it` in the vector `nums`. For every element, we update the `tmp` variable by performing a bitwise XOR between the current value of `tmp` and the element `it`.
- The XOR operation is performed using the `^` operator in C++.
- As we loop through the array, `tmp` accumulates the XOR of all elements in the array.

#### 4. Return the Final Result

```cpp
return tmp;
```

- Once we have iterated through all the elements of the array, `tmp` holds the final result of XORing all the elements together.
- We then return `tmp`, which represents the XOR beauty of the array.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is determined by the number of elements in the array. Specifically:

- The loop iterates over all `n` elements in the array, and for each element, a constant-time XOR operation is performed.
- Hence, the time complexity is \( O(n) \), where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity is determined by the amount of extra space used by the algorithm:

- We use only a constant amount of extra space: a single integer variable `tmp` to store the cumulative XOR result.
- Therefore, the space complexity is \( O(1) \), which means the algorithm uses constant space.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the XOR beauty of an array of integers. By leveraging the properties of the XOR operation, we are able to compute the result in linear time \( O(n) \) and constant space \( O(1) \). The XOR operation is fast and provides an elegant way to solve this problem. 

This approach is optimal and works well even for large arrays, as it processes each element exactly once and only requires a minimal amount of additional memory.
