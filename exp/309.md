### Problem Statement
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day. You want to maximize your profit by performing at most one transaction, with the following constraints:
- You can buy and sell the stock multiple times, but you must wait for one day after selling before buying again (cooldown).

### Approach
The solution employs dynamic programming with memoization to find the maximum profit while adhering to the constraints:

1. **State Representation**:
   - Use `dp(idx, buy, cool)` where:
     - `idx` is the current day (index in `prices`).
     - `buy` is a boolean indicating whether you currently hold the stock.
     - `cool` is a boolean indicating whether you are in the cooldown period after selling.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If `idx` equals the size of `prices`, return `0` since no profit can be made beyond the last day.

3. **Memoization Check**:
   - Before performing calculations, check if the result for the current state `(idx, buy, cool)` is already computed and stored in `memo`.

4. **Recursive Cases**:
   - If you don't take any action, call `dp(idx + 1, buy, false)` to move to the next day without changing the state.
   - If you are in a position to buy (i.e., holding stock and not in cooldown), compute potential profit by selling and transitioning to a cooldown state:
     - `res = max(res, dp(idx + 1, false, false) - nums[idx])`.
   - If you are not holding stock, compute potential profit by buying:
     - `res = max(res, dp(idx + 1, true, true) + nums[idx])`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Store the computed result in `memo` and return it.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A vector of integers `prices`.
- **Output**: An integer representing the maximum profit achievable.

1. Initialize the memoization array with `-1` to indicate uncomputed states.
2. Store the prices in the class variable for easy access.
3. Start the dynamic programming process by calling `dp(0, true, false)` to represent the initial state.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of days in `prices`. Each state is computed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the memoization table storing results for each state.
