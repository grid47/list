### Problem Statement
In this problem, we are tasked with simulating the outcomes of rolling a die `n` times, where each face of the die can appear consecutively for a maximum of a specified number of times. Given a vector `rollMax` where `rollMax[i]` indicates the maximum number of consecutive times the face `i+1` can be rolled, the goal is to calculate the total number of distinct sequences of die rolls that can be formed under these constraints. The answer should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Approach
To solve this problem, we utilize dynamic programming (DP) to count the number of valid sequences. The steps involved in the approach are as follows:

1. **Initialization**: We set up a memoization array to store the results of previously computed states to avoid redundant calculations.
2. **Recursive Function**: Implement a recursive function that determines the number of ways to roll the die from the current index, considering the last rolled face and how many times it has been consecutively rolled.
3. **Transitioning States**: For each roll, if the same face is rolled consecutively (without exceeding its allowed count), we continue to that face; otherwise, we roll a different face and reset the consecutive count.
4. **Base Case**: When the number of rolls reaches `n`, we have found a valid sequence, and we count that as one valid arrangement.
5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the total count of valid sequences.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
    vector<int> rm;
    int n;
    int mem[5001][7][16];
```
- **Lines 1-5**: Define the `Solution` class and declare variables. The `mod` variable holds the modulo value \(10^9 + 7\). The vector `rm` stores the maximum consecutive rolls allowed for each die face. The integer `n` represents the total number of rolls, and `mem` is a 3D array for memoization, which will help in storing results for the state defined by the current index, the previous face rolled, and the count of consecutive rolls.

```cpp
    int dp(int idx, int prv, int cnt) {
```
- **Line 6**: Define the recursive function `dp` which takes the current index `idx`, the previous rolled face `prv`, and the count of how many times that face has been rolled consecutively `cnt`.

```cpp
        if(idx == n) return 1;
```
- **Line 7**: Check the base case. If the current index `idx` equals `n`, it means we have successfully rolled the die `n` times, and we return `1` to count this sequence as valid.

```cpp
        if(mem[idx][prv + 1][cnt] != -1) return mem[idx][prv + 1][cnt];
```
- **Line 8**: Check the memoization array. If the value at `mem[idx][prv + 1][cnt]` is not `-1`, it means this state has been previously computed, so we return the stored result to avoid recomputation.

```cpp
        long ans = 0;
```
- **Line 9**: Initialize a variable `ans` to accumulate the count of valid sequences from this state.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < rm.size(); i++) {
```
- **Line 10**: Begin a loop to iterate over each die face.

```cpp
            if(i == prv && cnt < rm[i]) {
                ans = (ans + dp(idx + 1, i, cnt + 1)) % mod;
```
- **Lines 11-12**: Check if the current face `i` is the same as the previously rolled face `prv` and if we have not exceeded the maximum allowed consecutive rolls for that face (`cnt < rm[i]`). If both conditions are met, we recursively call `dp` for the next index `idx + 1`, keeping the same face `i` and incrementing the consecutive count `cnt + 1`.

```cpp
            } else if(i != prv) {
                ans = (ans + dp(idx + 1, i, 1)) % mod;                
            }
```
- **Lines 13-15**: If the current face `i` is different from the previous face `prv`, we reset the consecutive count to `1` and call `dp` recursively for the next index, indicating that we are rolling a different face.

```cpp
        }
```
- **Line 16**: Close the loop that iterates over all die faces.

```cpp
        return mem[idx][prv + 1][cnt] = ans % mod;
    }
```
- **Lines 17-18**: Store the computed result in the memoization array and return it, ensuring the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

```cpp
    int dieSimulator(int n, vector<int>& rollMax) {
        this->n = n;
        rm = rollMax;
        memset(mem, -1, sizeof(mem));
        return dp(0, -1, 0);
    }
};
```
- **Lines 19-24**: Define the main function `dieSimulator` that initializes the class variables, fills the memoization array with `-1`, and starts the recursive process from index `0`, with no previous face (`-1`) and a consecutive count of `0`.

### Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \cdot 6 \cdot 15)\) due to the nested loops over the number of rolls `n`, the possible previous die faces (6 faces), and the maximum allowed consecutive counts (up to 15). Thus, this leads to a complexity of \(O(n)\) since the upper limits are constants.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is \(O(n \cdot 6 \cdot 15)\) because of the memoization table, which stores the results of all states defined by `idx`, `prv`, and `cnt`. This results in a fixed space requirement based on the defined dimensions.

### Conclusion
The `dieSimulator` function effectively counts the number of distinct rolling sequences possible under the constraints of maximum consecutive rolls for each die face using dynamic programming. The use of memoization significantly reduces the number of computations needed, leading to efficient performance. By systematically exploring all potential sequences while respecting the roll limits, this solution provides a comprehensive way to simulate the outcomes of rolling a die multiple times, demonstrating both the power and elegance of dynamic programming techniques in algorithm design. The complexity analysis shows that this approach is efficient and suitable for the problem constraints, making it a viable solution for similar simulation problems in computational settings.
