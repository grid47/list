### Problem Statement
Given a sorted array of prime numbers, find the k-th smallest prime fraction. A prime fraction is defined as the fraction of two prime numbers \( \frac{a}{b} \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are elements from the array, and \( a < b \).

### Approach
1. **Priority Queue**:
   - Utilize a max-heap (priority queue) to efficiently retrieve the k-th smallest fraction.
   - The fractions are stored in the form of pairs: the fraction value and its indices in the array.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initially, push fractions of the form \( \frac{arr[i]}{arr[n-1]} \) for all valid \( i \) (where \( arr[n-1] \) is the largest element).

3. **Extracting k-th Smallest Fraction**:
   - Pop the top fraction from the heap \( k \) times.
   - For each fraction popped, if \( j > 0 \), push the fraction \( \frac{arr[i]}{arr[j-1]} \) back into the heap.
   - This step ensures that we explore the next possible fraction for the current numerator.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After processing k fractions, the last popped fraction will be the k-th smallest.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to find the k-th smallest prime fraction.
    - `vector<int> kthSmallestPrimeFraction(vector<int>& arr, int k)`: Main function to find the k-th smallest prime fraction.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `arr`: A sorted vector of prime numbers.
        - `k`: The index of the desired smallest fraction.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(k log k), due to the heap operations for k extractions and insertions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), for the storage of the fractions in the heap.
