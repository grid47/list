### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is **Combination Sum IV**, where we are given an array of integers `nums` and a target integer `target`. The goal is to determine how many combinations of numbers from the array can sum up to the target. A number in `nums` can be used multiple times in a combination, and the order of numbers in the combinations matters.

For example, given `nums = [1, 2, 3]` and `target = 4`, the valid combinations are:
- `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
- `[1, 1, 2]`
- `[2, 2]`
- `[1, 3]`
Thus, the answer is `7` because there are 7 ways to reach the target `4`.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we will use a **Dynamic Programming (DP)** approach. The main idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems, where we calculate the number of ways to reach every target from `0` to the given `target`.

1. **Dynamic Programming (Memoization)**: 
   We use a DP array (`mem`) where `mem[i]` stores the number of ways to achieve a sum of `i` using the elements of the `nums` array. Initially, we assume there are no ways to achieve any sum, and then we fill the DP array by considering all possible sums.

2. **Recursion with Memoization**:
   The function `dp(nums, left)` calculates the number of ways to reach the sum `left`. It recursively checks all possibilities by subtracting each number in `nums` from `left` and calculating the result for the reduced target. Memoization ensures that we do not recompute the number of ways for the same sum multiple times.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initializing Memoization
```cpp
vector<int> mem;
```
- A `vector<int> mem` is declared to store the results of subproblems. The index of the vector represents a target sum, and the value at that index represents the number of ways to achieve that sum.

```cpp
mem.resize(target + 1, -1);
```
- The vector `mem` is resized to hold values from `0` to `target` (i.e., `target + 1` elements). Initially, all elements are set to `-1`, indicating that these subproblems have not been solved yet.

#### Step 2: The `combinationSum4` Function
```cpp
return dp(nums, target);
```
- The main function `combinationSum4` calls the recursive helper function `dp` with the initial target value. This function will return the number of ways to achieve the target sum.

#### Step 3: The `dp` Function
```cpp
int dp(vector<int>& nums, int left) {
    if(left == 0) return 1;
    if(left < 0) return 0;
```
- The base cases are handled first:
  - If `left == 0`, it means we have found a valid combination, so we return `1`.
  - If `left < 0`, it means we have overshot the target, so we return `0` because no valid combination exists for this sum.

```cpp
if(mem[left] != -1) return mem[left];
```
- If the result for the current `left` has already been computed (i.e., `mem[left] != -1`), we return the stored value. This avoids redundant calculations and speeds up the algorithm by utilizing memoization.

```cpp
int res = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++)
    res += dp(nums, left - nums[i]);
```
- We initialize a variable `res` to store the number of ways to reach the sum `left`.
- The loop iterates over each number in `nums`. For each number, we subtract it from `left` and recursively call `dp(nums, left - nums[i])`. The result is added to `res`. This accounts for all possible ways to reach `left` by using each number in `nums`.

```cpp
return mem[left] = res;
```
- Once the number of ways to achieve the target sum `left` has been calculated, we store the result in `mem[left]` to avoid recalculating it in the future.

#### Step 4: Returning the Result
The final result is stored in `mem[target]`, which contains the number of ways to achieve the target sum using elements from `nums`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(target * n)**, where `n` is the size of the `nums` array and `target` is the target sum.
  - The function `dp` is called for each target sum from `0` to `target`.
  - For each call, we loop over all the elements in `nums`, making the time complexity **O(n)** for each target sum.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(target * n)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(target)**, where `target` is the target sum.
  - The space complexity is mainly due to the memoization vector `mem` that stores the results for all subproblems from `0` to `target`.
  - Additionally, the recursive call stack may use space, but since we are only computing results for a specific target and storing them in the `mem` array, the overall space complexity is **O(target)**.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the **Combination Sum IV** problem using **Dynamic Programming** with **Memoization**. By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing the results of each subproblem, we avoid redundant calculations, which significantly improves the performance of the solution.

The approach guarantees an optimal solution with a time complexity of **O(target * n)** and space complexity of **O(target)**. Memoization ensures that each subproblem is computed only once, making this approach both time-efficient and space-efficient. The recursive structure of the solution allows for clear and easy-to-understand code that elegantly handles different target sums and combinations.

In summary:
- **Time Complexity**: O(target * n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(target)
- **Efficient solution using dynamic programming and memoization**
- **Optimal for problems with overlapping subproblems**
