### Problem Statement
Given an array of distinct integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, you need to determine the number of possible combinations that add up to the target. The order of numbers in a combination matters (i.e., different orders of the same numbers count as different combinations).

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
   - Use a memoization array `mem` to store the results of previously computed states, preventing redundant calculations.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Implement a recursive function `dp` that computes the number of combinations that can sum up to the remaining target (denoted as `left`).
   - **Base Cases**:
     - If `left` is 0, return 1, indicating one valid combination has been found.
     - If `left` is negative, return 0, indicating no valid combination exists for this path.
   - If `mem[left]` is not `-1`, return the cached result from `mem`.

3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - Iterate through each number in `nums` and recursively call `dp` with the new target as `left - nums[i]`. Sum the results to get the total number of combinations.

4. **Result**:
   - Call the `dp` function with the original target to start the computation.

### Code Walk-through
- The `combinationSum4` function initializes the memoization vector `mem` and calls the recursive `dp` function.
- The `dp` function handles the base cases and recursively computes the number of combinations for the remaining target, caching results in `mem`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n \times t) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in `nums` and \( t \) is the `target`, as each state can take \( n \) calculations and there are \( t \) possible states.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(t) \) for the memoization array `mem`.
