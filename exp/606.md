### Problem Statement
Convert a binary tree into a string representation. The string format should follow these rules:
1. The root value should be printed first.
2. If the left child exists, its string representation should follow, enclosed in parentheses.
3. If the right child exists, its string representation should also follow, enclosed in parentheses.
4. If the left child does not exist, but the right child does, the left child should still be represented as an empty pair of parentheses `()`.
5. If both children are absent, nothing should be printed for them.

### Approach
1. **Recursive Traversal**:
   - Use a recursive function `tree2str` to traverse the tree and build the string representation.
   - Start from the root node, convert its value to a string, and append the string representations of its children.
   
2. **Handling Left and Right Children**:
   - If the left child exists, recursively call `tree2str` for the left child and enclose the result in parentheses.
   - If the right child exists, similarly, get the string for the right child and enclose it in parentheses.
   - If the left child does not exist but the right child does, include `()` for the left child.

3. **Base Case**:
   - If the current node is `NULL`, return an empty string.

### Code Walk-through
- The function first checks if the root is `NULL`. If it is, it returns an empty string.
- It builds the strings for the left and right subtrees recursively.
- It handles the cases where children may be absent, ensuring the correct format is maintained.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack.
