### Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and can be in any order.

### Approach
1. **Use a Set**: Store the elements of the first array (`nums1`) in an unordered set for efficient look-up.
2. **Iterate through the Second Array**: For each element in the second array (`nums2`), check if it exists in the set.
3. **Add to Result and Remove**: If an element from `nums2` is found in the set, add it to the result vector and remove it from the set to ensure uniqueness.

### Code Walk-through
- An unordered set is initialized with the elements of `nums1`.
- The code then iterates through each element in `nums2`, checking if it exists in the set. If it does, the element is added to the result vector, and it is erased from the set to avoid duplicates in the intersection.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Creating the set takes \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in `nums1`.
  - Checking for membership and inserting into the result takes \( O(m) \), where \( m \) is the number of elements in `nums2`.
  - Overall, the complexity is \( O(n + m) \).

- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) for storing the set.
