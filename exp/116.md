### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, connect all nodes at the same level to the next right node. If there is no next right node, the `next` pointer should be set to `NULL`. 

### Approach
1. Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach with a queue to traverse the tree level by level.
2. For each level:
   - Track the current node's `next` pointer using a variable `nextptr`.
   - Connect each node's `next` pointer to the previously processed node at the same level.
3. Enqueue the right child before the left child to ensure the `next` pointers are set correctly for each level.

### Code Walk-through
- **`connect` function**:
  - **Line 3**: Check if the `root` is `NULL`; if so, return `root`.
  - **Line 4**: Initialize a queue for BFS and push the `root`.
  - **Line 5**: Initialize `nextptr` to keep track of the current node's `next`.
  
- **Line 6-15**: Main BFS loop:
  - **Line 7**: Get the number of nodes at the current level (`sz`).
  - **Line 8**: Reset `nextptr` for the new level.
  - **Line 9-12**: For each node in the current level:
    - Connect its `next` pointer to `nextptr`.
    - Update `nextptr` to the current node.
    - Enqueue the right child followed by the left child.

- **Line 16**: Return the modified tree `root`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(W)\), where \(W\) is the maximum width of the tree, for the queue used in BFS.
