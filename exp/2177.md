### Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `num`, the task is to find three consecutive integers whose sum is equal to `num`. Specifically, we are looking for three integers `x-1`, `x`, and `x+1` such that:

\[
(x-1) + x + (x+1) = num
\]

If such a triplet of consecutive integers exists, return them as a vector of integers `[x-1, x, x+1]`. If no such triplet exists, return an empty vector.

### Approach

The solution relies on a simple mathematical observation: for three consecutive integers to sum up to a given number `num`, the number `num` must be divisible by 3. If `num % 3 != 0`, it is impossible to divide `num` into three equal parts and hence, we return an empty vector. Otherwise, we calculate the three consecutive integers by dividing `num` by 3 and adjusting for the three integers:

1. The integer `x` can be found by dividing `num` by 3 (`num / 3`).
2. The three consecutive integers are: `x-1`, `x`, and `x+1`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Function Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   vector<long long> sumOfThree(long long num) {
   ```
   - The function `sumOfThree` is defined to return a vector of `long long` integers, and it takes a `long long` number `num` as input.

2. **Check Divisibility by 3**:
   ```cpp
   if(num % 3 != 0) return ans;
   ```
   - Before proceeding with calculations, the first check ensures that `num` is divisible by 3 (`num % 3 != 0`).
   - If `num` is not divisible by 3, there is no valid triplet of consecutive integers, so an empty vector `ans` is returned.

3. **Calculate the Consecutive Integers**:
   ```cpp
   return {num / 3 - 1, num / 3, num / 3 + 1};
   ```
   - If `num` is divisible by 3, the triplet is calculated. 
   - First, `num / 3` gives the middle value `x` of the three consecutive integers.
   - The three consecutive integers are `x-1`, `x`, and `x+1`. These are returned as a vector: `{num / 3 - 1, num / 3, num / 3 + 1}`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The vector containing the three consecutive integers is returned if `num` is divisible by 3. Otherwise, an empty vector is returned.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1: `num = 9`

- **Step 1**: Check if `num % 3 == 0`. Since `9 % 3 == 0`, we proceed.
- **Step 2**: Calculate `x = 9 / 3 = 3`.
- **Step 3**: The three consecutive integers are: `x-1 = 2`, `x = 3`, and `x+1 = 4`.
- **Step 4**: Return the result as `{2, 3, 4}`.

#### Example 2: `num = 10`

- **Step 1**: Check if `num % 3 == 0`. Since `10 % 3 != 0`, we return an empty vector `[]`.

#### Example 3: `num = 15`

- **Step 1**: Check if `num % 3 == 0`. Since `15 % 3 == 0`, we proceed.
- **Step 2**: Calculate `x = 15 / 3 = 5`.
- **Step 3**: The three consecutive integers are: `x-1 = 4`, `x = 5`, and `x+1 = 6`.
- **Step 4**: Return the result as `{4, 5, 6}`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(1)**. This solution involves a constant number of arithmetic operations and conditional checks, making it a constant-time solution regardless of the input value of `num`.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)** as well. The solution only uses a fixed amount of space to store the result, which is a vector of three integers. No additional space is used that scales with the input size.

### Conclusion

The problem of finding three consecutive integers whose sum equals a given number `num` is solved efficiently in constant time and space. The approach leverages the divisibility of `num` by 3 to quickly determine whether a valid triplet exists. If `num` is divisible by 3, the solution computes the three consecutive integers using basic arithmetic. If not, it returns an empty vector to indicate that no such triplet exists. The algorithmâ€™s simplicity and efficiency make it well-suited for handling a wide range of inputs.
