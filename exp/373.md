### Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` sorted in ascending order, find the `k` smallest pairs `(u, v)` where `u` is from `nums1` and `v` is from `nums2`. The output should be a list of pairs sorted in ascending order based on the sum of the pairs.

### Approach
1. **Priority Queue**:
   - Use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the smallest sums and their corresponding pairs. This allows efficient retrieval of the smallest sums as we explore potential pairs.
  
2. **Initial Pair Insertion**:
   - Initially insert the pairs formed by the first element of `nums1` with the first element of `nums2`. This helps kickstart the process as we will always be adding the smallest potential sums first.

3. **Processing Pairs**:
   - Extract the smallest pair from the priority queue and push it to the result list.
   - After extracting a pair `(u, v)`, generate a new pair by replacing `v` with the next element in `nums2` (if it exists). This maintains the order of sums while exploring new pairs.

4. **Stopping Condition**:
   - Continue this process until we have found `k` pairs or exhausted all possible pairs.

### Code Walk-through
- The function `kSmallestPairs` initializes the priority queue and inserts the initial pairs.
- It enters a loop where it retrieves the smallest pair from the queue, updates the result list, and pushes a new pair based on the next element from `nums2`.
- Finally, it returns the collected `k` smallest pairs.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(k \log k) \), where \( k \) is the number of pairs we need to return. Each insertion and extraction operation from the priority queue takes logarithmic time.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(k) \) for storing the result pairs and the priority queue.
