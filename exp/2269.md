### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to find the number of **divisor substrings** of a given integer `num`. A divisor substring is a substring that divides the number `num` evenly. The problem is broken down as follows:

- You are given an integer `num` and an integer `k`.
- You need to consider all **k-digit substrings** of the integer `num`.
- For each substring of length `k`, check if the integer value of that substring divides `num` evenly (i.e., `num % substring == 0`).
- Count how many such substrings exist and return that count.

### Approach

We approach this problem by breaking it down step by step:
1. **Extracting Substrings**: We need to extract all possible **substrings** of length `k` from the number `num`.
2. **Checking Divisibility**: For each **k-digit substring**, we check whether it divides the original number `num` (i.e., if `num % substring == 0`).
3. **Count the Divisor Substrings**: For each valid substring that divides `num`, we increment the count.

We solve the problem efficiently by processing the number digit by digit rather than generating all substrings explicitly, making the solution optimal.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's break down the code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int divisorSubstrings(int num, int k) {
        int res = 0, cur = 0, pow = 1;
        for (int n = num; n > 0; n /= 10) {
            cur += (n % 10) * pow;  // Build the current substring
            if (--k > 0)             // Extend the length of the current substring
                pow *= 10;
            else {                   // When the substring reaches length k
                res += cur && !(num % cur);  // Check if it's a divisor of num
                cur /= 10;            // Remove the first digit from the current substring
            }
        }
        return res;        
    }
};
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. **Initial Variables**
```cpp
int res = 0, cur = 0, pow = 1;
```
- `res`: This variable stores the result, which is the count of valid divisor substrings.
- `cur`: This stores the current substring of length `k` as we extract it from the number `num`.
- `pow`: This keeps track of the positional value of the digits as we build the `cur` substring.

#### 2. **Loop Through the Digits of `num`**
```cpp
for (int n = num; n > 0; n /= 10) {
    cur += (n % 10) * pow;
```
- The loop iterates through each digit of the number `num`.
- `n % 10`: Extracts the last digit of `n` (which is a digit of `num`).
- `cur += (n % 10) * pow;`: Adds the digit to `cur`, adjusting its position by multiplying by `pow`.

#### 3. **Extend the Substring and Track the Power of Ten**
```cpp
if (--k > 0)
    pow *= 10;
```
- We decrement `k` to track how many digits we've added to the current substring. 
- If `k` is still greater than 0, it means we need to add more digits, and we multiply `pow` by 10 to move to the next positional value (e.g., from ones to tens, tens to hundreds, etc.).

#### 4. **Check Divisibility for Substrings of Length `k`**
```cpp
else {
    res += cur && !(num % cur);
    cur /= 10;
}
```
- When `k` reaches 0, the length of the substring is exactly `k`.
- We check if `cur` is a valid divisor of `num`:
  - `cur && !(num % cur)`: This ensures that `cur` is not zero and checks if `num % cur == 0` (i.e., `cur` divides `num`).
  - If the condition is true, we increment the result `res`.
- After this check, we divide `cur` by 10 to remove the first digit of the substring. This allows the loop to check the next possible substring of length `k`.

#### 5. **Return the Result**
```cpp
return res;
```
- Finally, we return the value of `res`, which contains the count of valid divisor substrings.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity
- **O(d)**, where `d` is the number of digits in `num` (i.e., the number of digits in the input integer `num`).
  - We only need to loop through each digit of `num` once.
  - For each digit, we perform a constant-time operation (adding digits to `cur`, checking divisibility, and adjusting `cur`).
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear in terms of the number of digits of `num`.

#### Space Complexity
- **O(1)**.
  - The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space: `res`, `cur`, and `pow`.
  - We do not use any additional data structures that grow with the input size, so the space complexity is constant.

### Conclusion

The solution to this problem involves efficiently extracting k-digit substrings from a number and checking if each substring divides the original number. By processing each digit of the number and dynamically adjusting the substring value, we avoid the need to explicitly generate all possible substrings, ensuring an optimal solution. The algorithm is efficient, with a time complexity of **O(d)**, where `d` is the number of digits in the input number. This makes the solution well-suited for large inputs.

This approach provides an excellent balance between clarity and performance, making it an effective solution to the problem.
