### Problem Statement
In the game of stones, there are two players who take turns removing stones from either end of a row of piles. Each pile has a certain number of stones. The objective is to maximize the number of stones a player can collect. Given an array `piles`, representing the number of stones in each pile, determine if the first player can win.

### Approach
We can solve this problem using **dynamic programming** to keep track of the optimal score difference between the two players at any given state. Here's how we approach it:

1. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   - We define a recursive function `dp(i, j)` that calculates the maximum score difference the current player can achieve over the opponent when considering piles from index `i` to `j`.
   - If `i` equals `j`, it means only one pile is left, and the current player can take all stones from that pile, returning `p[i]`.

2. **Memoization**:
   - To optimize the recursive calls, we use a memoization table `memo` to store already computed results for specific `(i, j)` pairs, avoiding redundant calculations.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - At each recursive call, the current player can choose either:
     - The pile at the left end (`p[i]`) and then the opponent will play from `(i + 1, j)`.
     - The pile at the right end (`p[j]`) and then the opponent will play from `(i, j - 1)`.
   - The result for the current state will be the maximum of these two choices:
     \[
     \text{result} = \max(p[i] - dp(i + 1, j), p[j] - dp(i, j - 1))
     \]

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - The first player wins if the score difference calculated by `dp(0, n - 1)` is non-negative.

### Code Walk-through
- The function initializes `p` with the input piles and sets `n` as the size of the piles.
- It calls the `dp` function starting from the full range of piles (0 to n-1).
- The result of the first player's potential winning is based on whether the computed score difference is greater than or equal to zero.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \), since there are \( O(n^2) \) possible states to calculate due to the nested loops over indices.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \), for the memoization table storing results for pairs of indices.
