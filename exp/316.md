### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. The result must be the smallest lexicographical order of letters that can be obtained from the original string.

### Approach
The solution uses a greedy algorithm with a stack to build the result while ensuring the letters are in the smallest lexicographical order. The main steps are:

1. **Frequency and Last Index Arrays**:
   - Use an array `frq` to count the frequency of each character in the string.
   - Use an array `lidx` to store the last index of each character.

2. **Processing the String**:
   - Iterate through the string:
     - For each character, check if it has been seen before (using a `seen` array).
     - If it has not been seen, compare it with the top of the stack:
       - While the stack is not empty and the top character is greater than the current character (ensuring a smaller lexicographical order), and the top character appears later in the string (using the last index), pop it from the stack.
       - Mark the popped character as not seen.
     - Push the current character onto the stack and mark it as seen.

3. **Constructing the Result**:
   - Once the entire string has been processed, pop all characters from the stack to form the result. 
   - Reverse the result string since characters were added in reverse order.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A string `s`.
- **Output**: A string representing the smallest lexicographical order of letters with no duplicates.

1. Count the frequency of each character and store their last indices.
2. Use a stack to construct the result while ensuring the smallest order.
3. Return the reversed result string.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. Each character is processed a limited number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) for the frequency, last index, and seen arrays since they are fixed size (26 for lowercase letters), and \(O(n)\) for the stack in the worst case.
