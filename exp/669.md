### Problem Statement
Given a binary search tree (BST) and a range [low, high], the goal is to trim the BST so that all values in the tree lie within this range. The trimmed tree should maintain the properties of a BST.

### Approach
1. **Recursive Traversal**:
   - The function `trimBST` recursively traverses the tree.
   - If the current node's value is less than `low`, it means all nodes in the left subtree can be discarded. Thus, we recursively call `trimBST` on the right child.
   - If the current node's value is greater than `high`, we discard all nodes in the right subtree and recursively call `trimBST` on the left child.
   - If the current node's value is within the range [low, high], we trim both the left and right subtrees.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the current node is `NULL`, return `NULL`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Input**: The function takes a `TreeNode* root`, and two integers `low` and `high`.
2. **Conditions**:
   - Check if `root` is `NULL`. If it is, return `NULL`.
   - If the node's value is less than `low`, call `trimBST` on the right subtree.
   - If the node's value is greater than `high`, call `trimBST` on the left subtree.
3. **Trimming Subtrees**:
   - If the node's value is within the range, recursively trim the left and right subtrees.
4. **Return**: Finally, return the current node after potentially trimming its subtrees.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, we may need to visit all nodes.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree due to the recursive call stack. In the case of a balanced tree, this will be O(log N), and in the case of a skewed tree, it will be O(N).
