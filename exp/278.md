### Problem Statement

In this problem, you are given an API `isBadVersion(int version)` that checks if a particular version of a software is a bad version. The function returns `true` if the version is bad, and `false` if it is not. The goal is to find the first bad version, given a total of `n` versions, using the most efficient approach possible.

The problem can be efficiently solved using a **binary search** strategy. The bad versions are sequential, so if version `k` is bad, then all versions after `k` will also be bad. Your task is to implement a function that determines the first bad version out of `n` versions, with a minimum number of calls to the `isBadVersion` API.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we will employ the **binary search** algorithm. Binary search is ideal for this problem because:
1. The versions are sequential and ordered, with the first bad version being the smallest bad version.
2. The problem guarantees that once a bad version is found, all subsequent versions will also be bad.

The binary search algorithm will help us find the first bad version by narrowing down the search space progressively until we locate the first version that is bad.

### Key Observations:
1. If `isBadVersion(mid)` returns `true` for a version `mid`, then all versions greater than `mid` are bad, and the first bad version could be `mid` or one of the versions before it.
2. If `isBadVersion(mid)` returns `false`, then all versions before `mid` are not bad, and we must search for the bad version among the higher-numbered versions.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize Search Range
```cpp
int s = 1, e = n;
```
- The variables `s` and `e` represent the start and end of the search range. Initially, the search is performed over the entire range of versions, from `1` to `n`.

#### Step 2: Begin Binary Search Loop
```cpp
while (s < e) {
```
- The loop continues as long as the search range has more than one element (`s < e`), meaning we haven't narrowed down the range to a single version.

#### Step 3: Calculate the Middle Point
```cpp
int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;
```
- The middle point `mid` is calculated. To avoid overflow (which can happen if `s` and `e` are large values), the formula `s + (e - s) / 2` is used to find the middle point.

#### Step 4: Check if `mid` is a Bad Version
```cpp
if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
    e = mid;
} else {
    s = mid + 1;
}
```
- If `mid` is a bad version (`isBadVersion(mid)` returns `true`), it means the first bad version is either `mid` itself or somewhere before `mid`, so we reduce the search space by updating `e` to `mid`.
- If `mid` is not a bad version, it means the first bad version must be in the higher part of the range, so we update `s` to `mid + 1`.

#### Step 5: Return the First Bad Version
```cpp
return e;
```
- At the end of the loop, `s` will equal `e`, and both will point to the first bad version. We return `e` as the result, which represents the first bad version.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the binary search approach is **O(log n)**, where `n` is the number of versions.
- This is because, with each iteration of the loop, we reduce the search space by half. Therefore, the number of iterations required to find the first bad version is proportional to the logarithm of `n` (base 2).

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)**, as the algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space. The search space is maintained using the variables `s` and `e`, and there are no additional data structures used that grow with the size of the input.

### Conclusion

The binary search approach is a highly efficient method for solving the problem of finding the first bad version. By leveraging the sequential and ordered nature of the problem, binary search allows us to reduce the search space by half with each iteration, ensuring that we find the first bad version in logarithmic time. This is the optimal solution for the problem, as it minimizes the number of API calls to `isBadVersion`, making it ideal for large values of `n`.

With a time complexity of **O(log n)** and a space complexity of **O(1)**, this solution is both time-efficient and space-efficient. It is an excellent example of applying binary search to problems where the input space can be divided into two distinct categories, such as bad and non-bad versions in this case.
