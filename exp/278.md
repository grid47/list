### Problem Statement
You are given an API `isBadVersion(version)` that returns whether a given version is bad. You need to find the first bad version in a range from `1` to `n`.

### Approach
The solution employs a binary search strategy to efficiently find the first bad version:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the start (`s`) to `1` and the end (`e`) to `n`.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - While the start is less than the end:
     - Calculate the middle point `mid`.
     - Use the `isBadVersion(mid)` API to check if the middle version is bad.
       - If it is bad, it means the first bad version could be `mid` or earlier, so update the end (`e`) to `mid`.
       - If it is not bad, move the start (`s`) to `mid + 1` since the first bad version must be after `mid`.

3. **Return**: Once the loop ends, `e` will point to the first bad version.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: An integer `n`, representing the total number of versions.
- **Output**: The first bad version number.

1. Initialize `s` to `1` and `e` to `n`.
2. Perform binary search:
   - Calculate `mid`.
   - Check if `isBadVersion(mid)` is true or false.
   - Adjust `s` or `e` accordingly.
3. After the loop, return `e`, which represents the first bad version.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\log n)\) since the search space is halved in each iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) as only a constant amount of extra space is used for variables.

### Edge Cases
1. **All Versions Bad**: If all versions are bad, the function should correctly identify the first version as `1`.
2. **No Bad Versions**: If there are no bad versions, the function will assume that `n` is bad.
