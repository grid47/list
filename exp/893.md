### Problem Statement
Given an array of strings `words`, you need to find the number of special-equivalent groups. Two strings are special-equivalent if they can be made equal by swapping characters at even indices with each other and characters at odd indices with each other.

### Approach
To determine the number of special-equivalent groups:
1. **Character Classification**:
   - For each string, separate its characters into two groups: characters at even indices and characters at odd indices.
   
2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the characters within each group. This allows us to standardize the representation of each string based on the characters it contains in even and odd positions.

3. **Unique Representation**:
   - Use a set to store unique pairs of sorted even and odd character groups. The size of the set will represent the number of special-equivalent groups.

### Steps
1. Initialize a set to keep track of unique pairs of sorted character groups.
2. Loop through each string in the `words` array:
   - Create a pair of strings for the sorted characters at even and odd indices.
   - Insert this pair into the set.
3. Return the size of the set, which indicates the number of unique special-equivalent groups.

### Code Walk-through
- The `numSpecialEquivGroups` function processes each word in the `words` vector, categorizing its characters and storing their sorted representations in a set.
- Finally, it returns the number of unique entries in the set.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \cdot m \log m)\), where \(n\) is the number of words and \(m\) is the maximum length of the words (due to sorting).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for storing unique pairs in the set.
