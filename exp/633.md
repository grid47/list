### Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `c`, determine if it can be expressed as the sum of the squares of two integers. In other words, check if there exist non-negative integers `a` and `b` such that \( a^2 + b^2 = c \).

### Approach
1. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Use two pointers: one starting from `0` (left) and another starting from the integer square root of `c` (right).
   - The left pointer will increment to check for larger values, while the right pointer will decrement to check for smaller values.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - Calculate the sum of squares \( \text{res} = \text{left}^2 + \text{right}^2 \).
   - If \( \text{res} < c \), it means the current sum is too small, so increment the left pointer.
   - If \( \text{res} > c \), it means the current sum is too large, so decrement the right pointer.
   - If \( \text{res} = c \), return `true` as we found a valid pair.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop continues until the left pointer exceeds the right pointer.
   - If no valid pair is found after the loop, return `false`.

### Code Walk-through
1. Initialize two pointers: `left` starting at `0` and `right` at `sqrt(c)`.
2. In a loop, calculate the sum of squares for the current pointers.
3. Adjust the pointers based on the comparison of the sum with `c`.
4. Return `true` if a valid pair is found; otherwise, return `false` after the loop.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(âˆšc), as we only iterate until the integer square root of `c`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of space for variables.
