### Problem Statement

In this problem, we are given `n` people in a circle, and a pillow is passed around between them. Initially, the first person holds the pillow, and it is passed clockwise until it reaches the last person. Once it reaches the last person, the pillow is passed in the reverse direction (counterclockwise) back to the first person. This cycle continues indefinitely.

The task is to determine which person will have the pillow after a given number of passes, `time`. The problem can be reduced to finding the position of the person who holds the pillow after `time` passes.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to simulate the passing of the pillow in a circular manner. However, instead of simulating each pass one-by-one, we can calculate the final position directly using the modulo operation, which helps us account for the circular nature of the passing.

1. **Circular Nature**:
   - The pillow moves in a pattern that can be thought of as a cycle. Starting from person `1`, the pillow moves clockwise until it reaches person `n`, after which it moves counterclockwise back to person `1`.
   - The cycle of the pillow movement is periodic with a length of `2n - 2` (since after `n - 1` steps, the pillow will have traveled a full circle, and then it moves back towards `1`).
   - This periodic nature means that after `time` passes, the pillow's position can be determined by considering the remainder when `time` is divided by `2n - 2`. This is known as taking the modulo `2n - 2`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - The time passes around the cycle, so after `time % (2n - 2)` passes, we can determine the final position by observing if the pillow is being passed in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction.
   - Specifically, the final position depends on whether the remainder after the modulo operation is less than `n` or greater than or equal to `n`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   int passThePillow(int n, int time) {
   ```
   The function `passThePillow` takes two arguments:
   - `n`: The number of people in the circle.
   - `time`: The number of passes of the pillow.

2. **Modular Arithmetic to Determine Position**:
   ```cpp
   return n - abs(n - 1 - time % (n * 2 - 2));
   ```
   - `time % (n * 2 - 2)`: First, we reduce the number of passes to a value within the range of one full cycle, which has a length of `2n - 2`. This ensures we are only considering the relevant portion of the cycle.
   
   - `n * 2 - 2`: This is the length of the cycle of passing the pillow. The pillow first moves from person `1` to person `n` (clockwise), and then moves from person `n` back to person `1` (counterclockwise), forming a periodic cycle of length `2n - 2`.
   
   - `time % (n * 2 - 2)`: The modulo operation gives the remainder after dividing `time` by `2n - 2`, effectively "wrapping" the number of passes back to the range of one full cycle.

   - `abs(n - 1 - time % (n * 2 - 2))`: After obtaining the remainder, we calculate the difference from the position `n - 1` (which corresponds to the last person in the clockwise direction). The `abs` function ensures that the result is always positive, representing the correct position in the cycle.
   
   - `n - abs(n - 1 - time % (n * 2 - 2))`: Finally, we subtract the result from `n` to compute the actual position of the person who holds the pillow. This formula accounts for both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions in the circular passing.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\), as the computation involves a few arithmetic operations and a modulo operation, all of which are constant time operations.

- **Space Complexity**:
  The space complexity is also \(O(1)\), as the function only uses a constant amount of extra space for intermediate variables.

### Conclusion

This solution provides an efficient way to determine the position of the person holding the pillow after `time` passes, without the need to simulate each individual pass. By leveraging modular arithmetic, we efficiently compute the position based on the periodic nature of the pillow passing. The solution runs in constant time and uses constant space, making it optimal for large inputs. The formula effectively handles both the clockwise and counterclockwise movements in the circular pattern, ensuring that the correct result is returned for any number of passes.
