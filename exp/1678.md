### Problem Statement

The problem at hand requires us to interpret a command string that consists of specific patterns representing characters. The input string can contain:

- The letter 'G' which remains 'G'.
- The sequence "()" which translates to 'o'.
- The sequence "(al)" which translates to 'al'.

The goal is to parse the command string and construct the output string based on these rules.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward character iteration technique. We will loop through each character of the input string, checking for specific sequences and building the result string accordingly. The process involves:

1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty result string to accumulate the interpreted characters.
2. **Character Traversal**: Iterate through the command string character by character.
3. **Pattern Matching**: 
   - When encountering 'G', simply add 'G' to the result.
   - When encountering '(', check the next characters:
     - If the next character is ')', append 'o' to the result and move the index forward.
     - If the next characters are 'a' followed by 'l', append 'al' to the result and adjust the index accordingly.
4. **Return the Result**: After processing the entire string, return the constructed result.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string interpret(string command) {
        string result = "";
```
- **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution` and create a public method `interpret`, which accepts a string parameter `command`.
- **Initialization**: A string `result` is initialized as an empty string to accumulate the interpreted output.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < command.size(); i++) {
```
- **Iteration**: We start a loop that goes through each character of the `command` string using an integer index `i`.

```cpp
            if(command[i] == '(') {
```
- **Check for Opening Parenthesis**: Inside the loop, we check if the current character is an opening parenthesis '('.

```cpp
                if(command[i + 1] == ')')
                    result += "o";
```
- **Check for Closing Parenthesis**: If the next character is a closing parenthesis ')', we append 'o' to the `result`.

```cpp
                if(command[i + 1] == 'a' && command[i + 2] == 'l') {
                    result += "al";
                    i += 2;
                }
```
- **Check for "al" Sequence**: If the next character is 'a' and the following one is 'l', we append 'al' to the `result` and increment the index `i` by 2 to skip over the 'a' and 'l' characters, since they have been processed.

```cpp
            }
            if(command[i] == 'G')
                result += "G";
```
- **Direct Addition of 'G'**: Outside the parentheses condition, we check if the current character is 'G'. If it is, we add 'G' directly to the `result`.

```cpp
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
- **Completion**: After the loop has processed all characters in the `command`, we return the `result` string containing the fully interpreted command.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the `command` string. We traverse the string once, and for each character, we perform a constant amount of work.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also \( O(n) \) in the worst case, as the result string could potentially grow to the same size as the input string in scenarios where there are no parentheses.

### Conclusion

This solution effectively interprets the given command string based on defined patterns through a single pass iteration, making it both efficient and straightforward. 

The key points of this implementation include:

1. **Simplicity**: The logic is clear and easy to follow. It leverages simple conditions to determine how to process different parts of the string.
  
2. **Efficiency**: The use of a single loop ensures that we handle each character of the input string in linear time, which is optimal for this problem.

3. **Scalability**: The approach is robust enough to handle variations in the command string length, maintaining performance as the size increases.

Overall, the code provides a clear and effective solution to interpreting a formatted command string, ensuring that it adheres to the specified translation rules while maintaining clarity and efficiency in its execution.
