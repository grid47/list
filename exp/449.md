### Problem Statement
Design a codec for serializing and deserializing a binary tree. Serialization is the process of converting a tree into a string, and deserialization is the process of converting that string back into the tree structure.

### Approach
1. **Serialization**:
   - Use a pre-order traversal (root-left-right) to serialize the tree.
   - Store the integer values of the nodes in a string by converting them to a byte representation.

2. **Deserialization**:
   - Reconstruct the tree from the serialized string using a recursive approach.
   - Use a position index to keep track of where to read in the serialized string.
   - Ensure that the values fall within the valid range for binary search trees (BST) to maintain the correct structure.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Serialize Function**:
   - The `serialize` method initializes an empty string and calls the helper function `serial` to populate it.
   - The `serial` function checks if the current node is null; if not, it copies the integer value into a character array and appends it to the string. It then recursively serializes the left and right children.

2. **Deserialize Function**:
   - The `deserialize` method initializes the position index and calls the helper function `deserial`.
   - The `deserial` function reads the integer value from the string and checks if it is within the valid range. If it is, a new node is created, and the function recursively constructs the left and right subtrees.

3. **Memory Management**:
   - The nodes are dynamically allocated using `new`, and proper memory management practices should be followed to prevent memory leaks.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is processed once during serialization and deserialization.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the serialized string and the recursion stack used during deserialization.
