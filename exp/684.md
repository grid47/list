### Problem Statement
You are given a list of edges in an undirected graph, where each edge connects two nodes. The graph initially has no cycles. However, the list may contain one redundant edge that, when added, creates a cycle. Your task is to identify and return that redundant edge.

### Approach
The approach leverages the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to detect cycles efficiently while processing the edges. The steps are as follows:

1. **Union-Find Structure**: Implement a Union-Find (UF) class that supports the union and find operations to manage and track connected components.

2. **Initialize the Union-Find**: Start with each node as its own parent. The `cnt` variable keeps track of the number of connected components.

3. **Process Edges**: Iterate through the list of edges and attempt to union the two nodes of each edge:
   - If the nodes are already connected (i.e., they have the same root), the current edge is redundant and creates a cycle.
   - If they are not connected, union them and continue.

4. **Return the Redundant Edge**: As soon as a cycle is detected by trying to union two already connected nodes, return that edge.

### Code Walk-through
- The `UF` class initializes the parent array and counts the number of components. The `uni` function connects two nodes and decreases the component count if they were previously disconnected. The `find` function retrieves the root parent of a node, applying path compression for efficiency.
- In the `Solution` class, the `findRedundantConnection` function creates an instance of `UF`, processes each edge, and checks for cycles using the `uni` method.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(E α(N)), where E is the number of edges and α is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly, making the operation nearly constant for practical input sizes.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the graph, for storing the parent array.

This method is efficient for cycle detection in undirected graphs and works well within the given constraints.
