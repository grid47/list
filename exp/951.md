### Problem Statement
Given two binary trees, determine if they are flip equivalent. Two binary trees are considered flip equivalent if they can be made identical by swapping the left and right children of some nodes.

### Approach
1. **Base Cases**:
   - If both nodes are `NULL`, they are equivalent.
   - If only one of the nodes is `NULL`, they are not equivalent.

2. **Check Node Values**:
   - If the values of the current nodes (`root1` and `root2`) are not equal, return `false`.

3. **Recursive Checks**:
   - Recursively check for two scenarios:
     - The left subtree of `root1` is equivalent to the left subtree of `root2` and the right subtree of `root1` is equivalent to the right subtree of `root2`.
     - The left subtree of `root1` is equivalent to the right subtree of `root2` and the right subtree of `root1` is equivalent to the left subtree of `root2`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the logical OR of the results of the two scenarios.

### Code Walk-through
- The function first checks for base cases of `NULL` nodes.
- It then checks the values of the nodes and recursively evaluates the two possible subtree equivalences.
- The final result is a boolean indicating if the trees are flip equivalent.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the trees, since each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the trees, due to the recursive stack.
