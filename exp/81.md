### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates and an integer `target`, determine if `target` exists in the array. The array is sorted in ascending order but may have been rotated at some unknown pivot.

### Approach
1. **Binary Search with Adjustments**:
   - Use a modified binary search to handle the potential rotation and duplicates in the array.
   
2. **Pointers Initialization**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to denote the current search range.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - While `l` is less than or equal to `r`:
     - Calculate the mid-point `mid` using the formula `mid = l + (r - l) / 2`.
     - Check if `nums[mid]` is equal to `target`. If yes, return true.
     - If `nums[l]`, `nums[mid]`, and `nums[r]` are all equal, increment `l` and decrement `r` to reduce the search space.
     - Determine which half of the array is properly sorted:
       - If the left half (`nums[l]` to `nums[mid]`) is sorted:
         - Check if `target` is within this range. If so, search in the left half; otherwise, search in the right half.
       - If the right half (`nums[mid]` to `nums[r]`) is sorted:
         - Check if `target` is within this range. If so, search in the right half; otherwise, search in the left half.

4. **Return Result**:
   - If the loop completes without finding the target, return false.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: Start with the left and right pointers at the beginning and end of the array, respectively.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: 
   - In each iteration, evaluate the middle element and adjust pointers based on whether the left or right halves are sorted.

3. **Handling Duplicates**: 
   - If duplicates are encountered at both ends, adjust the search space by moving the left and right pointers inward.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \) in the worst case due to duplicates causing linear scanning.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \) as no additional space is required apart from the input variables.
