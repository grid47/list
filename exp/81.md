### Problem Statement

The problem is to determine whether a target number exists in a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates. The array is initially sorted in ascending order but then rotated at some pivot. The challenge lies in the fact that duplicates might be present in the array, which makes it more difficult to apply a typical binary search. The task is to implement an efficient solution that searches for the target in the given array and returns `true` if it is present and `false` otherwise.

### Approach

The solution utilizes a **modified binary search** to efficiently search for the target in the rotated sorted array. The key challenge here is to handle the presence of duplicates in the array, which can interfere with the typical binary search. In a rotated sorted array, the left and right halves are not always distinct, especially when duplicates are present. The binary search must account for this by adjusting the search range when duplicates are encountered.

#### Key observations for the approach:

1. **Array is rotated and sorted:** The array was initially sorted but has been rotated at an unknown pivot.
2. **Duplicates are allowed:** This complicates the binary search, as duplicates might cause the search range to become unclear.
3. **Binary Search on the rotated sorted array:** The typical binary search approach must be adjusted to handle the array's rotation and the presence of duplicates.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Function Definition
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
```
- We define the `search` function, which takes in two parameters:
  - `nums`: The rotated sorted array (which may contain duplicates).
  - `target`: The number we need to search for in the array.

#### Step 2: Initializing Pointers
```cpp
int l = 0;
int r = nums.size() - 1;
```
- We initialize two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to the first and last indices of the array, respectively. These pointers will help us narrow down the search range.

#### Step 3: While Loop for Binary Search
```cpp
while(l <= r)
{
    int mid = l + (r-l) / 2;
    if (nums[mid] == target)
        return true;
```
- A `while` loop runs as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. This loop will continue searching until we either find the target or exhaust the search space.
- We calculate the midpoint `mid` using `l + (r-l) / 2` to avoid overflow, which is a common technique for calculating mid in binary search.
- If the element at `mid` equals the target, we return `true` immediately, indicating that the target has been found.

#### Step 4: Handling Duplicates
```cpp
if((nums[l] == nums[mid]) && (nums[r] == nums[mid]))
{
    l++;
    r--;
}
```
- This condition checks for a special case where both the left (`nums[l]`) and right (`nums[r]`) elements are equal to the `mid` element (`nums[mid]`). In this case, we can't definitively determine which side of the array (left or right) is sorted because of the duplicates.
- To handle this, we increment `l` and decrement `r`, effectively narrowing the search window by removing the duplicates at both ends. This is a crucial adjustment for handling duplicates in a rotated sorted array.

#### Step 5: Standard Binary Search Adjustments
```cpp
else if(nums[l] <= nums[mid])
{
    // target is in the first half
    if((nums[l] <= target) && (nums[mid] > target))
        r = mid - 1;
    else
        l = mid + 1;
}
```
- If the left part of the array is sorted (`nums[l] <= nums[mid]`), then we check if the target lies in the first half of the array.
  - If `nums[l] <= target` and `nums[mid] > target`, the target must be in the left half of the array, so we move `r` to `mid - 1`.
  - Otherwise, the target is in the right half, and we adjust `l` to `mid + 1`.

#### Step 6: Handling the Right Half of the Array
```cpp
else
{
    if((nums[mid] < target) && (nums[r] >= target))
        l = mid + 1;
    else
        r = mid - 1;
}
```
- If the right part of the array is sorted (`nums[mid] < nums[r]`), we check if the target lies in the right half of the array.
  - If `nums[mid] < target` and `nums[r] >= target`, the target must be in the right half of the array, so we move `l` to `mid + 1`.
  - Otherwise, the target must be in the left half, so we adjust `r` to `mid - 1`.

#### Step 7: Return Statement
```cpp
return false;
```
- If we exit the while loop without finding the target, we return `false`, indicating that the target is not present in the array.

#### Complete Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.size() - 1;
        
        while (l <= r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] == target)
                return true;
            
            if ((nums[l] == nums[mid]) && (nums[r] == nums[mid])) {
                l++;
                r--;
            } 
            else if (nums[l] <= nums[mid]) {
                // Target is in the first half
                if ((nums[l] <= target) && (nums[mid] > target))
                    r = mid - 1;
                else
                    l = mid + 1;
            } 
            else {
                if ((nums[mid] < target) && (nums[r] >= target))
                    l = mid + 1;
                else
                    r = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** in the worst case. Although binary search typically operates in **O(log n)**, the presence of duplicates in the array can cause the algorithm to degrade to linear search in certain cases. This happens when we encounter duplicate elements at the boundaries of the search range (`nums[l] == nums[mid]` and `nums[r] == nums[mid]`), causing the pointers `l` and `r` to move one step at a time, thus leading to **O(n)** complexity in the worst case.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is **O(1)** because we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables like `l`, `r`, and `mid`. The algorithm performs in-place searches without requiring additional memory allocation for data structures like arrays or hashmaps.

### Conclusion

The solution efficiently handles searching for a target in a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates. The approach adapts the standard binary search to account for duplicates by adjusting the search range when necessary. Despite the presence of duplicates, the algorithm ensures that we do not unnecessarily check all elements in the array, offering a solution that is both effective and optimal in most scenarios. While the worst-case time complexity is linear in the case of many duplicates, this solution remains efficient for moderate-sized arrays.
