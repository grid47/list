### Problem Statement
You are given an array `people` where `people[i] = [h_i, k_i]` represents the height of the i-th person and the number of people in front of them who have a height greater than or equal to `h_i`. The goal is to reconstruct the queue based on these rules.

### Approach
1. **Sorting**: First, sort the `people` array. The sorting criteria are:
   - Sort by height in descending order. Taller people come first.
   - If two people have the same height, sort by the number of people in front of them in ascending order.
   
2. **Reconstruction**: Initialize an empty vector `ans` to hold the reconstructed queue. For each person `p` in the sorted list:
   - Insert `p` into `ans` at the index specified by `p[1]`. This ensures that the correct number of people in front of each person is maintained.

3. **Return Result**: After processing all people, return the reconstructed queue `ans`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Sorting the Array**: The `sort` function is used with a custom comparator defined as a lambda function. This sorts the `people` based on the height and the number of people in front.
2. **Building the Queue**: The `for` loop iterates over the sorted `people`. The `insert` method places each person at the correct position in the `ans` vector, ensuring that the condition for each person's `k` value is satisfied.
3. **Final Output**: Return the `ans` vector containing the reconstructed queue.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of people. The sorting step dominates the complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the output queue.
