### Problem Statement

The problem requires calculating the total distance traveled by a vehicle, given the following conditions:

- A vehicle starts with `mt` (number of fuel units), and each fuel unit allows the vehicle to travel a certain distance.
- Each time the vehicle uses fuel, it consumes at most 5 fuel units per cycle.
- After consuming 5 units of fuel, the vehicle gains an extra fuel unit if there is additional fuel (`at`) available.
- The task is to calculate the total distance traveled by the vehicle given these mechanics, by considering how much fuel the vehicle uses and how much additional fuel is gained.

### Approach

To solve the problem, we need to simulate the travel process by repeatedly using the available fuel in increments of up to 5 units, while accounting for the fuel replenishment when the fuel consumption reaches 5 units. The key steps involved are:

1. **Fuel Consumption**:
   - In each cycle, the vehicle consumes up to 5 units of fuel (whichever is smaller between 5 and the current available fuel).
   
2. **Fuel Gain**:
   - If 5 units of fuel are used, the vehicle gains an additional fuel unit, but only if there is any additional fuel (`at` > 0).
   
3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - For each cycle of fuel consumption, the distance is incremented by 10 miles for every unit of fuel used. This distance is added to the total.

4. **Termination**:
   - The process continues until all available fuel (`mt`) is consumed or replenished until no more cycles can occur.

The approach is primarily a simulation of the described behavior, calculating the distance at each step while managing the fuel usage and replenishment conditions.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's break down the code line by line:

```cpp
int distanceTraveled(int mt, int at) {        
    int net = 0;
```

- **Initial Setup**:
  - `mt` represents the number of fuel units initially available.
  - `at` represents the additional fuel units that can be gained.
  - `net` is initialized to 0 and will be used to track the total distance traveled.

```cpp
    while(mt > 0) {
        int red = min(5, mt);
```

- **While Loop**:
  - The `while` loop runs as long as `mt` (fuel) is greater than 0. It ensures the process continues until there is no more fuel left.
  - Inside the loop, we calculate `red`, the number of fuel units to be consumed in this cycle. This is the smaller value between 5 and the current amount of fuel `mt`.

```cpp
        mt -= red;
        net += red * 10;
```

- **Fuel Consumption**:
  - After determining how many fuel units to consume (`red`), the fuel `mt` is reduced by `red`.
  - The total distance (`net`) is increased by `red * 10`. This means each fuel unit consumed contributes 10 miles to the total distance.

```cpp
        if(red == 5 && at > 0) {
            mt += 1;
            at--;
        }
```

- **Fuel Gain Condition**:
  - If 5 fuel units were consumed in the current cycle (`red == 5`), and there is any additional fuel available (`at > 0`), the vehicle gains an extra unit of fuel.
  - The fuel (`mt`) is increased by 1, and the additional fuel (`at`) is reduced by 1. This represents the process of gaining additional fuel after using a full set of 5 units.

```cpp
    }
```

- The `while` loop continues to repeat these steps, consuming fuel in increments of up to 5 units, adding to the total distance, and occasionally gaining fuel until the available fuel is exhausted.

```cpp
    return net;
}
```

- **Returning the Result**:
  - Once all fuel has been used and the loop ends, the function returns the total distance traveled, stored in `net`.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity

Let’s analyze the time complexity of the solution:

1. **While Loop**:
   - The `while` loop runs as long as there is fuel left (`mt > 0`). On each iteration, the fuel consumption reduces by at most 5 units (`red = min(5, mt)`).
   - The loop will run approximately \( \frac{mt}{5} \) times, as each iteration consumes up to 5 units of fuel.

2. **Constant Time Operations**:
   - In each iteration, we perform constant time operations: calculating the minimum, updating fuel values, and adding to the distance. These operations take \( O(1) \) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(\frac{mt}{5}) \), which simplifies to \( O(mt) \), where `mt` is the initial amount of fuel.

#### Space Complexity

- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables (`net`, `red`, etc.). No additional data structures are used that scale with the input size.
- Thus, the space complexity is \( O(1) \), which means the solution uses constant space regardless of the input size.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently calculates the total distance traveled by simulating the vehicle’s fuel consumption and replenishment cycle. By following the given mechanics, it ensures that the correct distance is computed based on the fuel available and the potential for replenishment. The algorithm runs in linear time relative to the initial amount of fuel, making it efficient for a wide range of input sizes. 

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(mt) \), where `mt` is the initial amount of fuel.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \), as only a fixed amount of extra space is used.

The solution is simple, intuitive, and works well for the problem constraints.
