### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, find two indices such that the numbers at those indices add up to the target.

### Approach
Use a hash map to store each number's complement (`target - nums[i]`) along with its index as you iterate through `nums`. For each element, check if it exists in the map as a key. If it does, the current index and the stored index provide the solution. Otherwise, add the complement to the map.

### Code Walk-through
1. Create a map `mp` to store each number's complement with its index.
2. Loop through `nums`. For each number:
   - Check if it exists in `mp`.
   - If it does, return the indices as `{ mp[nums[i]], i }`.
   - Otherwise, store `target - nums[i]` in the map with the current index.
3. If no solution is found, return `{-1, -1}`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) - The code iterates through `nums` once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) - Space is used for storing elements in the hash map.
