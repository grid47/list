### 💡 **Two Sum Problem** – Let's Solve It Together!

The **Two Sum** problem is a beloved challenge for coders everywhere. The task is simple but can be tricky: **find two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum.** Let's dive into how we can solve this problem with a smart approach!

### 📝 **What’s the Problem?**

You are given:
- An integer `target` — the number we want to reach by adding two numbers.
- An array of integers `nums` — a collection of numbers where we need to find the pair that sums to the target.

Your goal is to **return the indices of the two numbers** that add up to the target. It’s guaranteed that there will be exactly one solution, and **you can't reuse the same element twice**.

### 🔍 **A Clever Approach: Using a Hashmap**

This problem can be solved efficiently using a **hashmap** (also known as a dictionary in some languages). The idea is simple: we can use the hashmap to store numbers and quickly check if we’ve already seen a number that, when added to the current one, will give us the target.

### Step-by-Step: How We’ll Tackle It

1. **Step 1: Traverse the Array**  
   We’ll go through each number in the array one by one. For each number, we’ll calculate the **difference** between the target and the current number. This difference is the number we need to find.

2. **Step 2: Check if We’ve Seen the Complement**  
   As we go through the array, we’ll check if the difference (`target - nums[i]`) is already in our hashmap. If it is, then we’ve found our answer! The current number and its complement add up to the target. We can immediately return the indices of these two numbers.

3. **Step 3: Store the Current Number in the Hashmap**  
   If we don’t find the complement, no worries! We’ll store the current number in the hashmap, so we can check it later when we find a possible pair.

### 🧑‍💻 **Let’s Look at the Code!**

Here’s how we can implement this approach in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;  // Hashmap to store numbers and their indices

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        // Check if the complement exists in the hashmap
        if (mp.count(nums[i])) {
            return { mp[nums[i]], i };  // We found a match!
        }
        // If not, store the complement of the current number in the hashmap
        mp[target - nums[i]] = i;
    }

    // Return {-1, -1} if no solution is found (just in case, but there will be one)
    return {-1, -1};
}
```

### 🌟 **Handling Edge Cases**

- While the problem guarantees there’s always a solution, if for some reason we didn’t find a pair after going through the entire array, we would return `{-1, -1}`. But rest assured, **the problem guarantees a solution!** 🧑‍💻

### ⏱️ **Understanding Time and Space Complexity**

Let’s take a moment to understand the efficiency of our solution:

- **Time Complexity**:  
  **O(n)** — We go through the array once. For each number, we do constant-time operations (map lookups and inserts). This means our solution works in **linear time**, making it super efficient for large arrays.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  **O(n)** — We use a hashmap to store up to `n` elements in the worst case. So, the space complexity is **linear** as well. But don’t worry—this is a trade-off for faster lookups!

### 💡 **Why This Approach Rocks!**

By using the hashmap, we only need **one pass** through the array to find our solution. This makes the algorithm **super efficient** compared to a brute-force solution (which would have to check every pair and would take **O(n²)** time).

### 🏁 **You Got This!**

The beauty of this approach is how **simple** and **efficient** it is. You get the job done with just a single loop through the array, thanks to the magic of the hashmap. It’s an elegant solution that’s perfect for handling large datasets. 

We’ve turned a potentially tricky problem into something **manageable** and **easy to understand**, and I know you’ve got the skills to tackle it. Let’s go, coder! 🚀
