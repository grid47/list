### Problem Statement
You are given a string representing a valid number in the format "(x.y)" where `x` and `y` can be non-empty strings of digits. Your task is to find all possible valid coordinates by splitting the number into two parts: one before and one after the decimal point, while ensuring each part satisfies the rules of a valid decimal representation.

### Approach
1. **Splitting the String**:
   - The string `S` is of the form `"(xy)"`, where `x` and `y` represent digits. The goal is to split `xy` into two non-empty parts `A` and `B` such that `A` represents the x-coordinate and `B` represents the y-coordinate.

2. **Generating Valid Coordinates**:
   - Create a helper function `f` that takes a string and generates all valid decimal representations of that string.
   - The rules for a valid decimal number are:
     - A number cannot have leading zeros unless it is exactly "0".
     - A number can have a decimal point, but it cannot have trailing zeros (e.g., "1.0" is invalid).

3. **Iterating Through Possible Splits**:
   - For each possible split of `S`, call the helper function `f` on both parts (the left and right of the split) to get valid representations.
   - Combine these representations into coordinate pairs.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - Collect all valid coordinate pairs and return them.

### Code Walk-through
- The `ambiguousCoordinates` function iterates through possible split points in `S` and generates valid pairs using the helper function.
- The helper function `f` checks the conditions for valid numbers and returns all possible valid representations for a given string.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst case, where `n` is the length of the string. This accounts for generating all valid splits and checking them.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the results and intermediate representations.

This solution effectively handles the constraints for valid number representations and generates all possible valid coordinates.
