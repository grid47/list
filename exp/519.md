### Problem Statement
Design a solution that allows you to randomly flip a cell in a `m x n` grid and keep track of the flipped cells. The goal is to ensure that each cell can only be flipped once, and the `reset` method can be called to reset the state of the grid.

### Approach
1. **Mapping Flips**:
   - Use a hash map `mp` to store the mapping of flipped cells to their new positions. This allows us to maintain the integrity of the random selection without duplication.

2. **Index Calculation**:
   - Calculate a random index within the current limit (`lmt`), which initially represents the total number of cells.
   - When a cell is flipped, decrement `lmt` to reduce the available pool of cells.

3. **Handling Flips**:
   - If the randomly selected index has already been flipped (exists in the map), retrieve the position stored in the map.
   - If it has not been flipped, use it directly as the selected cell.
   - Update the mapping to reflect the flipped state and maintain the random nature of the selection by swapping the current index with the last unflipped index.

4. **Resetting**:
   - The `reset` method clears the map and restores the limit to the original total number of cells, preparing the grid for a new set of flips.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Constructor**:
   - The `Solution` constructor initializes the grid dimensions and calls the `reset` method to set the initial state.

2. **Flip Method**:
   - The `flip` method randomly selects an index, updates the mapping, and returns the coordinates of the flipped cell as a vector.

3. **Reset Method**:
   - The `reset` method clears the map and resets the limit to the total number of cells, allowing for fresh flips.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for both `flip` and `reset` operations, since operations on the map and basic arithmetic are constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the storage of flipped cells in the map, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
