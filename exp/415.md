### Problem Statement
Given two non-negative integers represented as strings `num1` and `num2`, return their sum as a string. The strings may not represent valid integer formats (like leading zeros) and can be of different lengths.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: Set up variables to track the current position in each string (`i` for `num1`, `j` for `num2`) and an integer `carry` to handle the sum of digits.
2. **Iterate through Strings**: Use a while loop to continue processing as long as there are digits left in either string or there is a carry:
   - If there are digits left in `num1`, add the corresponding digit to `carry`.
   - If there are digits left in `num2`, add the corresponding digit to `carry`.
3. **Calculate Current Digit**: Compute the current digit by taking `carry % 10` and append it to the result string.
4. **Update Carry**: Update `carry` to be `carry / 10` for the next iteration.
5. **Reverse the Result**: Since the digits are added in reverse order, reverse the result string before returning it.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Loop Setup**: Initialize `i` and `j` to the last index of `num1` and `num2`, respectively.
2. **Processing Loop**: In each iteration:
   - Check if there are still digits in `num1` or `num2` to add.
   - Update the `carry` and current digit based on available digits.
3. **Appending Results**: Use the `+=` operator to build the result string, which is built in reverse order.
4. **Final Result**: After exiting the loop, reverse `ans` and return it as the final sum.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(max(m, n)), where m and n are the lengths of `num1` and `num2`. The loop runs for the length of the longer string plus any carry.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the integer variables and O(max(m, n)) for the resulting string, which holds the maximum possible sum length.
