### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, find the maximum XOR of any two elements in the array. The XOR of two integers is the bitwise exclusive OR operation that returns a number whose bits are set to 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different.

### Approach
1. **Trie Structure**: Utilize a binary trie (prefix tree) to efficiently store binary representations of the numbers. Each `TrieNode` has two children representing the binary digits `0` and `1`.
2. **Adding Numbers**: 
   - For each number, insert its 32-bit binary representation into the trie, starting from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB).
3. **Finding Maximum XOR**:
   - For each number in `nums`, traverse the trie to find the number that maximizes the XOR result.
   - At each bit position, try to take the opposite bit (1 - current bit) if it exists, as this would contribute to a higher XOR value.
4. **Result Calculation**: Keep track of the maximum XOR value found during these traversals.

### Code Walk-through
1. **TrieNode Class**: Defines the structure of a trie node with methods to add numbers and find the maximum XOR.
   - `add(int num)`: Inserts the binary representation of `num` into the trie.
   - `max(int num)`: Computes the maximum XOR that can be formed with `num` by traversing the trie.
2. **Solution Class**: 
   - Create a root `TrieNode` to serve as the starting point.
   - Add each number from `nums` to the trie.
   - For each number, calculate the potential maximum XOR using the `max` method.
   - Return the overall maximum XOR found.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * 32), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. Each number is processed in constant time due to the fixed 32-bit length.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * 32), as the trie could potentially store up to `2 * n` nodes in the worst case (one for each bit of each number).
