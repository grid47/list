### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums`, partition it into two parts such that all elements in the first part are less than or equal to all elements in the second part. Return the length of the first part.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Start by defining `max_i` to track the maximum element in the left partition.
   - Define `cur` to track the maximum value encountered so far while iterating through the array.
   - Initialize `ans` to 1, which represents the minimum possible length of the first partition.

2. **Iterate through the Array**:
   - For each element in the array (starting from the second element):
     - If the current element is less than `max_i`, it means the partition needs to move. Update `max_i` to `cur` and set `ans` to the current index plus one.
     - If the current element is greater than `cur`, update `cur` to the current element.

3. **Return Result**:
   - After completing the iteration, return `ans`, which represents the length of the first partition.

### Code Walk-through
- Start with the first element of the array, initializing `max_i` and `cur`.
- Traverse through the rest of the array, updating `max_i`, `cur`, and `ans` based on the conditions mentioned.
- Finally, the result is returned.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, since we traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional data structures are used that scale with the input size.
