### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree and return its root.

### Approach
- **Recursive Traversal**: Use a depth-first approach to traverse the tree.
- **Swapping Nodes**: For each node:
  - Swap its left and right children.
  - Recursively invert the left and right subtrees.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function `invertTree(TreeNode* root)`**:
  - Base Case: If the `root` is `NULL`, return `NULL`.
  - Store the left child in a temporary variable `tmp`.
  - Recursively call `invertTree` on the right child and assign it to the left child.
  - Recursively call `invertTree` on `tmp` and assign it to the right child.
  - Return the `root`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. This accounts for the recursive call stack in the worst case (for a skewed tree).
