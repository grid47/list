### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` containing characters `"|"` and `"*"`, and a list of queries `q`, each query contains two indices `[l, r]`. Our task is to calculate the number of `"*"` characters between the `"|"` characters (candles) within each query range `[l, r]`. If there are no candles in the range or they don't enclose any `"*"`, return `0` for that query.

### Approach

The solution uses an efficient precomputation strategy with three arrays:
1. **Left Nearest Candle Array** (`left`): Stores the index of the nearest candle to the left of or at each position.
2. **Right Nearest Candle Array** (`right`): Stores the index of the nearest candle to the right of or at each position.
3. **Cumulative Count Array** (`count`): Tracks the cumulative count of candles up to each position.

The function iterates through each query to calculate the number of plates (asterisks) between the nearest candles found using these arrays.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Initialize Arrays**: 
   - `left`, `right`, and `count` are initialized to store information about the nearest candles on either side and the cumulative candle count.
   - `ans` is an array for storing results of each query.

    ```cpp
    int n = s.length();
    vector<int> left(n, 0), right(n, 0), count(n, 0), ans(q.size(), 0);
    ```

2. **Precompute Nearest Left Candle and Cumulative Count**:
   - Traverse from left to right.
   - Update `node` (index of the latest candle seen) and `cnt` (candle count).
   - For each position, if it contains a candle (`"|"`), set `node` to the current index and increment `cnt`.
   - Assign `left[i] = node` to track the leftmost candle for each position, and store the cumulative candle count in `count`.

    ```cpp
    int node = -1;
    int cnt  = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(s[i] == '|') {
            node = i;
            cnt++;
        }
        left[i] = node;
        count[i] = cnt;
    }
    ```

3. **Precompute Nearest Right Candle**:
   - Traverse from right to left.
   - Update `node` with the nearest candle on the right for each position and store it in `right`.

    ```cpp
    node = -1;
    for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if(s[i] == '|'){
            node = i;
        }
        right[i] = node;
    }
    ```

4. **Process Queries**:
   - For each query `[l, r]`:
     - Get the nearest candle to the left of `r` (`left[r]`) and to the right of `l` (`right[l]`).
     - If either candle is missing in the range or they donâ€™t enclose any `"*"`, set the result to `0`.
     - Otherwise, calculate the number of plates as `r - l + 1 - c`:
       - `c` is the difference between the cumulative counts of candles at `r` and `l`.

    ```cpp
    int idx = 0;
    for(vector<int> qr : q) {
        int r = left[qr[1]];
        int l = right[qr[0]];
        if (r == -1 || l == -1 || r - l <= 1) {
            ans[idx] = 0;
        } else {
            int c = count[r] - count[l] + 1;
            ans[idx] = r - l + 1 - c;
        }
        idx++;
    }
    ```

5. **Return the Result**: The `ans` array contains the result for each query.

    ```cpp
    return ans;
    ```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N + Q), where `N` is the length of `s` and `Q` is the number of queries. This is because precomputing the `left`, `right`, and `count` arrays takes O(N), and each query is processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N + Q), where `N` is for the precomputed arrays (`left`, `right`, `count`) and `Q` is for storing query results.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently handles multiple queries by precomputing candle positions and cumulative counts, allowing each query to be resolved in constant time. This approach is optimal for scenarios with large strings and numerous queries, delivering quick responses by leveraging precomputed data.
