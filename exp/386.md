### Problem Statement

The problem requires generating a list of numbers in **lexicographical order** (like dictionary order) from 1 to `n`. For instance, if `n = 13`, the output should be:

```
[1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

The challenge here is to generate this sequence efficiently without sorting, and ensure that the numbers are produced in lexicographical order. The solution needs to handle large values of `n` (up to 10^9) efficiently.

### Approach

The solution takes advantage of **depth-first search (DFS)** to traverse the numbers in a lexicographical manner. By leveraging the structure of numbers, the solution generates the sequence without explicitly storing all numbers first and sorting them later.

#### Key Insights:
1. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - Lexicographical order compares strings or numbers as if they were alphabetic. For example, `1, 10, 11, 12` comes before `2, 3, 4, ...`.
   - This is similar to how a tree structure works where starting at any number `x`, the next possible numbers are generated by appending digits (e.g., from `1`, you get `10, 100, 101,...`).

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - A depth-first approach allows us to explore each number starting from `1`, appending digits as long as the number is smaller than or equal to `n`.
   - After exploring numbers formed by appending zeroes (like `1, 10, 100, 101, ...`), the algorithm proceeds to the next number at the same level (like from `1` to `2`).

3. **Recursive Backtracking**:
   - The recursive function `d(int x)` explores one branch of possible lexicographical numbers at a time.
   - Starting from `x = 1`, the function tries to form numbers by multiplying by 10 (to explore deeper branches like `10, 100, 1000,...`) and adds 1 to `x` to explore the next number in the sequence.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. **Class Declaration**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int num;
    vector<int> ans;
```
- The class `Solution` contains two main members:
  - `num`: an integer variable to store the value of `n`, which is the upper limit for generating the lexicographical order.
  - `ans`: a vector to store the results — the numbers in lexicographical order from `1` to `n`.

#### 2. **lexicalOrder Function**
```cpp
vector<int> lexicalOrder(int n) {
    num = n;
    d(1);
    return ans;
}
```
- This is the public function that the user calls with the integer `n`. It initializes `num` with `n`, then starts the recursive function `d(1)` from the number `1` to generate the sequence.
- Once the sequence is generated, it returns the vector `ans` containing the lexicographically ordered numbers.

#### 3. **Recursive DFS Function**
```cpp
void d(int x) {
    if(x > num) return;
    ans.push_back(x);
    d(x * 10);
    if((x % 10) < 9) d(x + 1);
}
```
- The recursive function `d(int x)` is where the depth-first search happens:
  - **Base Case**: If `x` exceeds `num`, it terminates the recursion for that branch (`if(x > num) return`).
  - **Add to Answer**: The current number `x` is added to the result vector `ans` (`ans.push_back(x)`).
  - **Recursively explore deeper numbers**: The function first calls `d(x * 10)` to explore numbers formed by appending zeroes (e.g., `1 → 10, 100, 1000, ...`).
  - **Explore the next number**: If `x % 10` is less than 9, the function also recursively calls `d(x + 1)` to explore the next number in sequence (e.g., from `1` to `2`, from `2` to `3`, etc.).

#### 4. **Explaining the Recursive Calls**
- Let's break down the recursive calls for a smaller example with `n = 13`:
  - Start with `d(1)`. The number `1` is added to `ans`, then `d(10)` is called to explore deeper numbers.
    - From `d(10)`, `10` is added, then `d(100)` is called. However, `100 > 13`, so the function returns without adding more numbers.
    - Then, `d(11)` is called, where `11` is added, followed by `d(110)` which returns without adding anything.
    - Then `d(12)` is called, followed by `d(120)` which also returns without adding.
    - After this, `d(13)` is called and added to the result.
  - After reaching `13`, the function proceeds to `d(2)` (the next number after `1`), and the process repeats similarly for numbers `2, 3, 4, ..., 9`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The **time complexity** is **O(n)**, where `n` is the input number. This is because each number from `1` to `n` is added to the result exactly once, and the recursion only visits each number once.
- The recursive calls explore numbers in lexicographical order, ensuring that each number is processed efficiently without redundant computations.

#### Space Complexity:
- The **space complexity** is **O(n)**, which is the space required to store the output vector `ans` containing all the numbers from `1` to `n` in lexicographical order.
- The recursive stack also contributes to the space complexity, though it typically has a depth of `O(log n)` (since each recursive call explores numbers by multiplying by 10 or adding 1).

### Conclusion

This solution uses a **depth-first search (DFS)** approach to generate numbers in **lexicographical order** efficiently. The key advantage of this approach is that it avoids sorting and directly builds the numbers in the required order.

- **Efficient Traversal**: The use of recursion ensures that numbers are generated in lexicographical order directly without the need for sorting.
- **Space and Time Efficiency**: The algorithm uses a recursive strategy that minimizes unnecessary operations, achieving a time complexity of **O(n)** where `n` is the input limit.
- **Scalability**: This solution efficiently handles large values of `n` up to 10^9 without requiring excessive memory or time.

By leveraging DFS, this solution offers a clean and elegant way to generate the sequence of numbers in lexicographical order.
