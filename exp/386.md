### Problem Statement
Implement a function that returns the numbers from 1 to n in lexicographical order.

### Approach
To generate the numbers in lexicographical order, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The main idea is to explore numbers starting from 1 and go deeper by multiplying by 10 (to explore further digits) until we exceed `n`. We will also increment the current number when the last digit is less than 9 to ensure all possible numbers are covered.

1. **Initialization**:
   - Store the maximum number `n` and create a vector to hold the result.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Start from the number 1.
   - Push the current number onto the result vector.
   - Recursively call the function by multiplying the current number by 10 (to go deeper into that "branch").
   - After exploring deeper, check if the last digit is less than 9. If it is, call the function with the current number incremented by 1.

3. **Base Case**:
   - If the current number exceeds `n`, terminate that branch of recursion.

### Code Walk-through
- The `lexicalOrder` function initializes the maximum number and starts the DFS from 1.
- The `d` function performs the recursive exploration of numbers.
- The result is built in a vector `ans`, which will contain the numbers in lexicographical order by the end of the exploration.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), as every number from 1 to n is added once to the result.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the output vector storing the result.
