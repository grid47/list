### Problem Statement
The problem asks us to count the number of subarrays in a given array `nums` whose sum of elements multiplied by the length of the subarray is strictly less than a given value `k`. In mathematical terms, for each subarray `nums[i..j]`, the condition to satisfy is:

\[ \text{sum(nums[i..j])} \times \text{length(nums[i..j]))} < k \]

The task is to return the total number of such subarrays.

### Approach
The solution to this problem involves iterating through the `nums` array while keeping track of the running sum of the subarrays. The goal is to count all valid subarrays efficiently. To do this, we can use a **sliding window** approach, where we maintain a window of elements that satisfy the given condition. By adjusting the window’s start point dynamically, we can efficiently count the valid subarrays.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Initialization:**
   ```cpp
   long long sum = 0, j = 0, res = 0;
   ```
   - `sum`: This variable will store the running sum of elements within the current window.
   - `j`: This is the start index of the sliding window.
   - `res`: This will accumulate the total number of valid subarrays.

2. **Outer Loop - Iterate Over `nums`:**
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
   ```
   - We loop over the array, with `i` being the end index of the current subarray.
   
3. **Update Running Sum:**
   ```cpp
   sum += nums[i];
   ```
   - We add the current element `nums[i]` to the running sum for the window ending at `i`.

4. **Inner While Loop - Shrink Window if Condition Violated:**
   ```cpp
   while(sum * (i - j + 1) >= k) sum -= nums[j++];
   ```
   - Here, we check whether the condition `sum * (i - j + 1) >= k` holds. If it does, it means that the current subarray from index `j` to `i` is invalid, so we shrink the window by incrementing `j` (i.e., we remove `nums[j]` from the sum).
   - We continue adjusting the window by incrementing `j` until the condition is satisfied.

5. **Count Valid Subarrays:**
   ```cpp
   res += (i - j + 1);
   ```
   - After ensuring the subarray from `j` to `i` satisfies the condition, we know that all subarrays ending at `i` and starting from any index `j` through `i` are valid.
   - The number of such subarrays is `(i - j + 1)`. We add this count to `res`.

6. **Return Final Count:**
   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```
   - After iterating through the entire array, we return the total number of valid subarrays stored in `res`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The **outer loop** runs `n` times, where `n` is the size of the `nums` array.
- The **inner loop** (while loop) ensures that `j` only increments, and each index is processed at most once. This means that the total number of operations across all iterations of the outer loop is proportional to `2n`.
- Therefore, the **time complexity** of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array. This makes the algorithm very efficient and suitable for large arrays.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(1) because the solution only uses a constant amount of extra space: `sum`, `j`, and `res`.
- No additional space is used beyond these variables, making the space complexity optimal for this problem.

### Conclusion
This solution provides an efficient way to count the number of valid subarrays where the sum of elements multiplied by the length of the subarray is less than a given threshold `k`. By leveraging a sliding window technique with two pointers (`i` and `j`), the algorithm ensures that each element is processed only once, leading to a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the length of the array.

The sliding window approach is crucial for ensuring that the solution runs in linear time. The inner while loop dynamically adjusts the window to maintain the sum condition, and the outer loop counts all valid subarrays that satisfy the condition. This avoids the need for nested loops, making the solution both time and space efficient.

Overall, this solution strikes a balance between clarity and efficiency, offering a scalable approach to solving the problem with minimal overhead. It is ideal for problems that require counting subarrays or subsequences under certain conditions. The algorithm’s linear time complexity ensures that it can handle large input sizes, which is essential for performance in competitive programming and real-world applications.
