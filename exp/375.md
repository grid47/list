### Problem Statement
You are playing a game where you have to guess a number between 1 and `n`. You can ask for the price of guessing a number, and your goal is to minimize the total amount of money spent until you guess the correct number. Your task is to implement a function to determine the minimum amount of money required to guarantee a win.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a 2D table (`dp`) to store the minimum cost required to guess the number correctly in the range from `s` to `e`.
  
2. **Recursive Function**:
   - The recursive function `dpf` calculates the minimum cost to guess the number between `s` and `e`.
   - If `s >= e`, it returns 0 since no cost is incurred when there are no numbers to guess.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each possible guess `x` in the range `[s, e]`, calculate the cost of that guess. The cost is determined by the guess itself plus the maximum cost incurred by the worst-case scenario (either guessing too high or too low).
   - Update the minimum cost (`res`) by considering the cost of each guess.

4. **Memoization**:
   - Store the result in the `dp` table to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.

### Code Walk-through
- The `getMoneyAmount` function initializes the DP table and calls the recursive helper function.
- The `dpf` function computes the minimum amount needed to guess correctly in a given range and stores results in the DP table for reuse.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^3) \) because for each range `[s, e]`, we may iterate through `e - s` possible guesses and for each guess, we might need to make two further calls.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \) for the DP table to store results.
