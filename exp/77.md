### Problem Statement
Given two integers `n` and `k`, return all possible combinations of `k` numbers chosen from the range `[1, n]`.

### Approach
1. **Backtracking**:
   - Use a recursive backtracking method to explore all possible combinations.
   - Maintain a temporary vector to store the current combination being built.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the size of the temporary vector equals `k`, add it to the results.

3. **Recursive Exploration**:
   - Start from the current index `i` and try adding each number `j` from `i` to `n`.
   - After adding a number to the temporary vector, recursively call the backtracking function with the next index (`j + 1`).
   - Remove the last number (backtrack) after exploring all combinations that include it.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Set up the combination vector and call the backtracking function starting from `1`.
   
2. **Backtracking Function**:
   - Check if the temporary combination has reached the desired size (`k`).
   - If not, loop through possible numbers from the current index to `n`.
   - Add the number to the temporary combination and recurse for the next number.
   - After exploring with the current number, remove it from the combination and proceed.

3. **Return the Result**: 
   - After all recursive calls are complete, return the list of combinations.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(\binom{n}{k} \cdot k) \), where \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the number of combinations and \(k\) is the time taken to copy the current combination.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(k) \) for the temporary vector used to store combinations.
