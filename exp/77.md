### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to generate all possible combinations of size `k` from the numbers 1 to `n`. A combination is defined as a selection of items where the order of selection does not matter.

For example:
- **Input:** n = 4, k = 2
- **Output:** [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]

Here, we are asked to generate combinations where:
- The numbers are selected from 1 to `n`.
- Each combination contains exactly `k` numbers.
- The order of the numbers within a combination doesn't matter (i.e., `[1, 2]` is the same as `[2, 1]`).

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can use the **Backtracking** approach. The idea behind backtracking is to try out all possibilities recursively and backtrack when a choice does not lead to a solution. In this case, we will attempt to build combinations of `k` elements from the set `{1, 2, ..., n}`, and when we reach the desired size, we add that combination to the result list.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step approach:
1. **Recursive Backtracking:** We define a recursive function that explores all possible ways to form combinations. The recursive function will try to include each number in the combination one by one and then recurse to select the next numbers.
   
2. **Base Case:** The recursion terminates when the size of the current combination reaches `k`. At this point, we add the combination to the result.
   
3. **Backtracking:** If the current combination has not yet reached the desired size, we continue to add numbers, starting from the current number to `n`, to the combination. After exploring a possibility, we remove the last added element and try the next one (this is the backtracking step).

4. **Termination:** The recursive process stops when we either find all combinations or when it is impossible to form a combination of size `k` from the remaining numbers.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Define the `combine` function
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> combine(int n, int k) {
    this->n = n;
    vector<vector<int>> ans;
    vector<int> tmp;
    
    bt(ans, 1, k, tmp);
    return ans;
}
```
- **Inputs:** The function takes two parameters, `n` (the upper bound of the numbers) and `k` (the size of the combinations).
- We initialize the result container `ans` (a vector of vectors) to store the final combinations.
- We call the helper function `bt`, which is a recursive function to generate combinations, starting from number 1.

#### Step 2: Define the backtracking function (`bt`)
```cpp
void bt(vector<vector<int>> &ans, int i, int k, vector<int> &tmp) {
    if (tmp.size() == k) {
        ans.push_back(tmp);
        return;
    }
    if (i == n + 1) return;

    for (int j = i; j <= n; j++) {
        tmp.push_back(j); // include the number in the combination
        bt(ans, j + 1, k, tmp); // recurse to build the next part of the combination
        tmp.pop_back(); // backtrack, remove the number from the combination
    }
}
```
- **Inputs:** `ans` is the vector where all combinations will be stored. `i` is the current index we are considering to include in the combination, `k` is the target size of the combination, and `tmp` is the current combination being formed.
  
- **Base Case:** The recursion stops when the size of `tmp` becomes equal to `k`. At this point, we add `tmp` to `ans` since it represents a valid combination.

- **Termination:** If `i` exceeds `n`, there are no more numbers to consider, and we return from the function.

#### Step 3: The Loop to Generate Combinations
```cpp
for (int j = i; j <= n; j++) {
    tmp.push_back(j); // include number j in the current combination
    bt(ans, j + 1, k, tmp); // recurse with the next number
    tmp.pop_back(); // backtrack by removing the last number
}
```
- **Inner loop:** For each number `j` from `i` to `n`, we include it in the current combination and recursively attempt to form the next combination. After we explore all possibilities with the current number, we backtrack by removing it from `tmp`.

#### Step 4: Return the Result
```cpp
return ans;
```
- After all combinations have been generated, the function returns the vector `ans`, which contains all the valid combinations of size `k`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the solution can be estimated based on the number of combinations we generate:
- The number of combinations of `k` elements from `n` elements is given by the combination formula `C(n, k)`, which is `n! / (k! * (n-k)!)`.
- Each combination takes `O(k)` time to store and process.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(C(n, k) * k)**, where `C(n, k)` is the number of combinations.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is primarily determined by the space required to store the combinations.
- We store `C(n, k)` combinations, each of size `k`. Thus, the space complexity is **O(C(n, k) * k)**.

### Conclusion

The problem of generating all combinations of size `k` from a set of `n` elements is solved efficiently using the backtracking technique. By recursively building combinations and backtracking when necessary, we explore all possible combinations in a systematic manner. The time and space complexity of this solution depend on the number of combinations we need to generate, which is optimal for this problem. The algorithm is simple, elegant, and works within the constraints of the problem, offering an effective way to generate combinations of a given size.
