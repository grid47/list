### üè∑Ô∏è **Combinations of Size `k` from 1 to `n`**

Given two integers `n` and `k`, the task is to generate all possible combinations of size `k` from the numbers 1 to `n`. A combination is a selection of items where the order does not matter.

#### Example:
- **Input:** `n = 4, k = 2`
- **Output:** `[[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]`

In this problem:
- The numbers are selected from the range `1` to `n`.
- Each combination contains exactly `k` numbers.
- The order of numbers within a combination doesn't matter, i.e., `[1, 2]` is the same as `[2, 1]`.

### üß† **Approach**

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the **Backtracking** approach. The core idea is to recursively explore all possible combinations and backtrack when a choice does not lead to a valid solution. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Recursive Backtracking:** We define a recursive function that explores all ways to form combinations of size `k` from the set `{1, 2, ..., n}`. When a valid combination is found (of size `k`), it is added to the result.

2. **Base Case:** The recursion terminates when the size of the current combination reaches `k`. At this point, the combination is added to the result list.

3. **Backtracking:** If the current combination is not of size `k`, we continue to build it by adding numbers starting from the current number. After exploring a possibility, we remove the last added element and backtrack.

4. **Termination:** The recursion stops when it is impossible to form a combination of size `k` from the remaining numbers.

### üìù **Code Breakdown**

#### Step 1: Define the `combine` Function
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> combine(int n, int k) {
    this->n = n;
    vector<vector<int>> ans;
    vector<int> tmp;
    
    bt(ans, 1, k, tmp);
    return ans;
}
```
- **Inputs:** The function takes `n` (the upper bound of numbers) and `k` (the size of the combinations).
- Initialize the result container `ans` and the temporary vector `tmp` to store combinations.
- Call the helper function `bt`, which will generate combinations starting from the number 1.

#### Step 2: Define the Backtracking Function (`bt`)
```cpp
void bt(vector<vector<int>> &ans, int i, int k, vector<int> &tmp) {
    if (tmp.size() == k) {
        ans.push_back(tmp);
        return;
    }
    if (i == n + 1) return;

    for (int j = i; j <= n; j++) {
        tmp.push_back(j); // include number j in the combination
        bt(ans, j + 1, k, tmp); // recurse with the next number
        tmp.pop_back(); // backtrack, remove number j from the combination
    }
}
```
- **Inputs:** 
  - `ans`: Stores all valid combinations.
  - `i`: Current number being considered.
  - `k`: Target size of combinations.
  - `tmp`: Current combination being built.
  
- **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `tmp` has reached the target size `k`. We then add `tmp` to `ans`.

- **Termination:** If `i` exceeds `n`, there are no more numbers to consider, so the function returns.

#### Step 3: Loop to Generate Combinations
```cpp
for (int j = i; j <= n; j++) {
    tmp.push_back(j); // include number j in the current combination
    bt(ans, j + 1, k, tmp); // recurse to build the next part of the combination
    tmp.pop_back(); // backtrack by removing the last number
}
```
- The inner loop iterates from `i` to `n`. For each number `j`, it adds `j` to the current combination and recursively generates the next combination. After exploring with `j`, the function backtracks by removing `j` from the combination.

#### Step 4: Return the Result
```cpp
return ans;
```
- After all combinations are generated, return the `ans` vector containing the valid combinations.

### üßÆ **Complexity Analysis**

#### Time Complexity:
- The number of combinations of `k` elements from `n` elements is given by the combination formula `C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)`.
- Generating each combination takes `O(k)` time to store and process.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(C(n, k) * k)**, where `C(n, k)` is the number of combinations.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is mainly due to the storage of combinations. Since we generate `C(n, k)` combinations, each of size `k`, the space complexity is **O(C(n, k) * k)**.

### üéØ **Conclusion**

The problem of generating all combinations of size `k` from a set of `n` elements is solved efficiently using **backtracking**. By recursively building combinations and backtracking when necessary, we systematically explore all possibilities. The time and space complexity depend on the number of combinations, which is optimal for this problem.

This approach is elegant, simple, and effective for generating combinations of a given size from a range of numbers.

### ‚ú® **Key Takeaways**
- **Backtracking** is a powerful technique for exploring all possible solutions systematically.
- The algorithm runs in **O(C(n, k) * k)** time and **O(C(n, k) * k)** space, where `n` is the total number of elements and `k` is the combination size.
- This solution is efficient and optimal for generating combinations.
