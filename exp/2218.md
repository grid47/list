### Problem Statement

The problem asks to maximize the total value of coins that can be collected from a given set of piles, where the player is allowed to take coins from the piles in a specific way. The player can pick up to `k` coins from these piles, where each pile contains a list of coins. The objective is to determine the maximum value obtainable by picking up to `k` coins from these piles.

Each pile is represented as an array of coin values, and the coins can only be taken in sequence from the beginning of the pile. The challenge is to determine the maximum possible value obtainable by selecting up to `k` coins from the piles.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a **Dynamic Programming (DP)** approach. The key idea is to keep track of the maximum value that can be obtained by choosing coins from each pile. We can break down the problem into smaller subproblems and build the solution incrementally.

#### Dynamic Programming Explanation:
1. **State Representation**:
   - `dp(idx, k)`: This represents the maximum value obtainable starting from the `idx`-th pile and picking `k` coins.
   
2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For each pile at index `idx`, the player can choose any number of coins from the pile (up to `k`). For each choice, we calculate the value of coins selected from the pile, and then recursively calculate the maximum value obtainable from the remaining piles with the remaining coin limit.
   - We have two options:
     - Skip the current pile and move to the next pile, which gives us `dp(idx + 1, k)`.
     - Pick some coins from the current pile and recursively solve the problem for the remaining piles with the remaining coin limit.

3. **Memoization**:
   - To optimize the solution and avoid redundant calculations, we use memoization to store the results of subproblems in the `memo` array. This ensures that each subproblem is computed only once.

4. **Partial Sum**:
   - To speed up the calculation, we precompute the partial sum of the coins in each pile. The partial sum allows us to calculate the total value of coins taken from the first `i` coins of a pile in constant time.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Memoization Array and DP Function

```cpp
int memo[1001][2001];
int dp(vector<vector<int>>& piles, int idx, int k) {
    if(k == 0) return 0;
    if(idx == piles.size()) return INT_MIN;
    if(memo[idx][k] != -1) return memo[idx][k];
    int ans = dp(piles, idx + 1, k);
    for(int i = 0; i < piles[idx].size(); i++) {
        if(i < k)
            ans = max(ans, piles[idx][i] + dp(piles, idx + 1, k - (i + 1)));
    }
    return memo[idx][k] = ans;
}
```

- **Memoization**: The `memo` array is used to store the results of subproblems. It has dimensions `[1001][2001]`, where `1001` is the maximum number of piles and `2001` is the maximum number of coins that can be selected.
- **Base Cases**:
  - `k == 0`: If no more coins can be picked (`k = 0`), return 0 as there is no value to add.
  - `idx == piles.size()`: If there are no more piles left, return `INT_MIN` since no more coins can be picked from empty piles.
- **Memoization Check**: If the value has already been computed for the subproblem `dp(idx, k)`, return the stored value from `memo[idx][k]`.

#### Step 2: Partial Sum Calculation

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < piles.size(); i++)
    partial_sum(piles[i].begin(), piles[i].end(), piles[i].begin());
```

- This loop calculates the partial sum for each pile. The partial sum of a pile helps us efficiently calculate the sum of the first `i` coins from the pile. This is done using `partial_sum`, which computes the cumulative sum of elements in the pile.
  
#### Step 3: Final Function to Call DP

```cpp
memset(memo, -1, sizeof(memo));
return dp(piles, 0, k);
```

- The memoization array is initialized to `-1` to indicate that no subproblems have been solved yet.
- The main DP function is called with `dp(piles, 0, k)`, starting from the first pile (`idx = 0`) and with `k` coins to be selected.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **Memoization Recursion**: The total number of subproblems is `O(piles.size() * k)`, where `piles.size()` is the number of piles and `k` is the number of coins.
- **Partial Sum Calculation**: The partial sum for each pile is calculated in linear time relative to the number of coins in the pile, so this step takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the total number of coins across all piles.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity is **O(n * k)**, where `n` is the total number of coins and `k` is the number of coins we can select.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Memoization Array**: The `memo` array has dimensions `[1001][2001]`, so it takes `O(n * k)` space.
- **Recursion Stack**: The recursion stack depth can go up to `O(n)` in the worst case.
- **Overall Space Complexity**: The overall space complexity is **O(n * k)**, where `n` is the total number of coins and `k` is the number of coins we can select.

### Conclusion

The problem of maximizing the total value of coins picked from multiple piles can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming with memoization. By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing intermediate results, we can avoid redundant computations and optimize the solution.

- **Time Complexity**: **O(n * k)**
- **Space Complexity**: **O(n * k)**

The solution is efficient and should work well for large inputs within the problem constraints. With the use of memoization, the DP approach ensures that we compute the maximum value obtainable by selecting up to `k` coins in a time-efficient manner.
