### Problem Statement
Given a reference to a node in a connected undirected graph, clone the entire graph. Each node in the graph contains a value and a list of its neighbors.

### Approach
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Use a recursive DFS approach to traverse the graph and clone each node and its neighbors.
   - Maintain a mapping of original nodes to their corresponding cloned nodes to avoid duplication and ensure the graph structure is preserved.

### Code Walk-through
- **`cloneGraph` function**:
  - **Line 7**: Checks if the input node is `NULL`. If it is, returns `NULL`.
  - **Line 9**: Calls the helper function `copy` to clone the graph starting from the given node.

- **`copy` function**:
  - **Line 12**: Checks if the node has already been cloned by checking the map. If it has, returns the cloned node.
  - **Line 13**: Creates a new node for the clone.
  - **Line 14**: Stores the mapping of the original node to its clone.
  - **Line 15-17**: Iterates through the neighbors of the original node, recursively cloning each neighbor and adding it to the cloned node's neighbors.
  - **Line 18**: Returns the cloned node.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of nodes and \(E\) is the number of edges, as each node and edge is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(V)\) for the map storing the cloned nodes, plus \(O(V)\) for the recursion stack in the worst case (for deep graphs).
