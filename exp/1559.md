### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to determine whether there exists a cycle in a 2D grid composed of characters. A cycle is defined as a path that begins and ends at the same character, and the path can only move in four directions (up, down, left, right). The cycle must consist of adjacent cells that contain the same character. The objective is to find an efficient solution to identify the presence of such cycles within the grid.

### Approach

The approach utilized in this solution employs Depth First Search (DFS) to explore the grid while keeping track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them. The key components of the approach are as follows:

1. **Grid Dimensions**: First, the dimensions of the grid are obtained to facilitate boundary checks during traversal.

2. **Visited Cells**: A 2D vector `vis` is initialized to keep track of which cells have already been explored. This prevents infinite loops in the case of cycles.

3. **Iterating Through the Grid**: The algorithm iterates through each cell in the grid. If a cell has not been visited, it triggers a DFS starting from that cell.

4. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function recursively explores neighboring cells. It checks if a neighboring cell is within bounds, has not been visited, and contains the same character as the current cell.

5. **Cycle Detection**: During the DFS, if a neighboring cell has already been visited and is not the parent of the current cell (the one from which we came), a cycle is detected.

6. **Return Value**: If a cycle is found during any of the DFS calls, the function returns true. If all cells are processed without detecting a cycle, it returns false.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Letâ€™s analyze the provided code step-by-step:

- **Class Declaration**:
    The solution is encapsulated in a class named `Solution`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
```

- **Main Function**:
    The `containsCycle` function takes a 2D vector of characters as input and returns a boolean indicating whether a cycle exists.

```cpp
bool containsCycle(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
```

- **Grid Dimensions**:
    The dimensions of the grid are stored in `m` and `n`.

```cpp
int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
```

- **Visited Array Initialization**:
    A 2D vector `vis` is initialized to keep track of visited cells.

```cpp
vector<vector<bool>> vis(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
```

- **Iterating Through Each Cell**:
    The outer loops iterate through all the cells in the grid.

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) 
for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) 
```

- **Trigger DFS**:
    If a cell has not been visited, initiate a DFS.

```cpp
if(!vis[i][j] && dfs(grid, vis, i, j, -1, -1, grid[i][j])) return true;
```

- **Return Statement**:
    If no cycles are detected, return false.

```cpp
return false;
```

- **Direction Array**:
    An array `dir` is defined to facilitate movement in four directions.

```cpp
int dir[4][2] = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
```

- **DFS Function Definition**:
    The `dfs` function is defined, which takes the grid, visited vector, current cell indices, previous cell indices, and the character being checked.

```cpp
bool dfs(vector<vector<char>> &grid, vector<vector<bool>> &vis, int i, int j, int pi, int pj, char node) {
```

- **Cycle Check**:
    If the current cell has been visited, it indicates a cycle.

```cpp
if(vis[i][j]) return true;
```

- **Mark Cell as Visited**:
    Mark the current cell as visited.

```cpp
vis[i][j] = true;
```

- **Explore Neighbors**:
    The loop explores neighboring cells using the direction array.

```cpp
for(auto d: dir) {
    int ni = i + d[0];
    int nj = j + d[1];
```

- **Boundary and Character Check**:
    Check for boundaries and ensure the character matches.

```cpp
if(min(ni, nj) < 0 || 
   ni > grid.size() - 1 || 
   nj > grid[0].size() - 1 ||
   grid[ni][nj] != node)
    continue;
```

- **Skip Parent Check**:
    Ensure we do not revisit the cell from which we came.

```cpp
if((ni == pi) && (nj == pj)) continue;
```

- **Recursive DFS Call**:
    Perform DFS on the valid neighboring cell.

```cpp
if(dfs(grid, vis, ni, nj, i, j, node))
    return true;
```

- **Return False**:
    If no cycle is found in the current path, return false.

```cpp
return false;
}
```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the solution is \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns in the grid. Each cell is processed at most once due to the visited check, leading to a linear traversal of the grid.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also \(O(m \times n)\) due to the additional space used for the `vis` vector that tracks visited cells.

### Conclusion

The provided solution effectively determines the presence of cycles in a 2D character grid using Depth First Search (DFS). By exploring the grid while keeping track of visited cells, the algorithm can efficiently detect cycles formed by adjacent cells containing the same character. This approach not only simplifies the problem-solving process but also demonstrates the power of recursive techniques in handling grid-based challenges. The solution's time and space complexities make it suitable for practical applications, ensuring optimal performance even with larger grids. Understanding this implementation provides valuable insights into cycle detection algorithms and enhances problem-solving skills related to graph traversal techniques.
