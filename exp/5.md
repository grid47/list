### Problem Statement

The problem is to find the **longest palindromic substring** in a given string `s`. A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. The goal is to return the longest substring of `s` that is a palindrome.

For example:
- Input: `"babad"`
- Output: `"bab"` or `"aba"` (both are correct, but either can be returned)

The string may be of length up to **10^3**, so the solution needs to be efficient enough to handle large inputs.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a **center-expansion technique**. This method works by considering every character (and pair of adjacent characters) in the string as a potential center of a palindrome. From each center, we try to expand outwards as long as the characters on both sides are the same, thereby finding the longest palindrome centered at that point.

The key steps in the approach are:
1. **Iterate Over Each Character:** For each character in the string, we treat it as the center of a potential palindrome. We expand both to the left and to the right to check if the characters around the center are the same.
   
2. **Handle Both Odd and Even Length Palindromes:** 
   - For odd-length palindromes, the center is a single character.
   - For even-length palindromes, the center is a pair of characters.
   
3. **Track the Longest Palindrome:** While expanding the palindromes, we keep track of the longest one found so far.

4. **Return the Longest Palindromic Substring:** Once all possible centers have been checked, we return the longest palindrome.

This approach is efficient because it only requires **O(n^2)** time, where `n` is the length of the string. This is feasible for strings of length up to **10^3**.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

```cpp
int lo, len;
```

- `lo`: The starting index of the longest palindrome found so far.
- `len`: The length of the longest palindrome found so far.

```cpp
len = 0;
```

- We initialize the length of the longest palindrome to `0` before we start checking.

#### Step 2: Iterate Over the String

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
    pal(s, i, i);
    pal(s, i, i + 1);
}
```

- We loop through each character in the string `s`. For each character `i`, we treat it as a possible center for both an **odd-length** palindrome (using `i` as the center) and an **even-length** palindrome (using `i` and `i+1` as the center).
- The function `pal(s, i, i)` checks for an odd-length palindrome, while `pal(s, i, i + 1)` checks for an even-length palindrome.

#### Step 3: Expand Around the Center

```cpp
void pal(string &s, int i, int j) {
    while(i >= 0 && j <= s.size() && s[i] == s[j]) {
        i--;
        j++;
    }
    if(len < j - i - 1) {
        lo = i + 1;
        len = j - i - 1;
    }
}
```

- The function `pal` is responsible for checking palindromes centered around the indices `i` and `j`.
  - **Expanding:** It uses a `while` loop to expand outward while `s[i] == s[j]` (i.e., while the characters at positions `i` and `j` are the same). It keeps expanding as long as the characters on both sides match.
  - **Updating the Longest Palindrome:** Once the loop ends (i.e., no further expansion is possible), we check if the current palindrome is the longest one found so far. If the length of the current palindrome (`j - i - 1`) is greater than `len`, we update `lo` to `i + 1` and `len` to `j - i - 1`. The `lo` stores the starting index of the palindrome, and `len` stores its length.

#### Step 4: Return the Longest Palindromic Substring

```cpp
return s.substr(lo, len);
```

- After all the potential centers have been checked, we return the longest palindromic substring by using `s.substr(lo, len)`. This extracts the substring from index `lo` with length `len`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The outer `for` loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the size of the string.
- Inside each iteration of the loop, the function `pal` performs an expansion operation that, in the worst case, can run up to **O(n)** time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n^2)**, where `n` is the length of the string.

This is efficient for strings up to **10^3** in length, as the total number of operations is on the order of 1 million in the worst case.

#### Space Complexity:
- The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space (for `lo`, `len`, `i`, and `j`), so the space complexity is **O(1)**.

### Conclusion

This solution effectively solves the problem of finding the longest palindromic substring by leveraging the center-expansion technique. It efficiently checks both odd and even-length palindromes by expanding from each character (and adjacent pair of characters) in the string. The time complexity of **O(n^2)** is acceptable for the problem's input size, and the space complexity is **O(1)**, making the solution optimal in terms of space usage.

The center-expansion approach is simple yet effective and provides an elegant solution to the problem without requiring additional space for dynamic programming tables or extra data structures.
