### Problem Statement

The problem requires us to search for a target value in a 2D matrix `mtx`, where each row is sorted in ascending order and each column is also sorted in ascending order. The goal is to determine whether the target value exists in the matrix. We need to find an efficient approach to search for the target without having to check every element.

Given these constraints:
1. **Rows are sorted in ascending order**.
2. **Columns are sorted in ascending order**.

The challenge is to search for the target in an efficient manner.

### Approach

The matrix is structured such that if you examine any row, its elements increase from left to right. Similarly, any column's elements increase from top to bottom. This sorted structure provides a way to search for an element efficiently using a **binary search** technique, rather than a brute-force approach that would check every element.

The idea is to treat the 2D matrix as a 1D array by flattening it into a single sequence of elements, and then perform a **binary search** on this 1D representation. This method takes advantage of the fact that each row and column is sorted and allows us to use binary search to reduce the time complexity of the search process.

#### Key Insights:
1. The matrix has rows and columns sorted in ascending order, which means that elements in any row and any column increase.
2. By flattening the matrix into a 1D array, we can use binary search, which works efficiently on sorted sequences.
3. The index in the 1D array corresponds to a position in the 2D matrix, which allows us to search across both dimensions efficiently.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Define the Matrix Dimensions
```cpp
int m = mtx.size(), n = mtx[0].size();
```
- We first get the number of rows `m` and the number of columns `n` from the matrix. This will help us calculate the correct index mapping in the flattened 1D representation.

#### Step 2: Initialize Binary Search Range
```cpp
int l = 0, r = m * n - 1;
```
- We initialize two pointers `l` and `r` that represent the left and right boundaries of the 1D search space.
- The matrix has `m * n` elements, so `l = 0` is the start index and `r = m * n - 1` is the end index in the 1D array.

#### Step 3: Perform Binary Search
```cpp
while(l <= r) {
    int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
    int rw = mid / n, c = mid % n, val = mtx[rw][c];
    if(val == target) return true;
    else if(val > target) r = mid - 1;
    else l = mid + 1;
}
```
- **Binary Search Loop**: 
    - While `l` is less than or equal to `r`, we calculate the middle index `mid`.
    - `mid / n` gives the row index `rw` of the flattened 1D array, and `mid % n` gives the column index `c` of the matrix.
    - The value `val` at this position in the matrix is then compared to the target value.
    - If `val` equals the target, we return `true` because the target is found.
    - If `val` is greater than the target, it means we need to search in the left half of the array (by adjusting `r` to `mid - 1`).
    - If `val` is less than the target, we need to search in the right half (by adjusting `l` to `mid + 1`).

#### Step 4: Return False if Target is Not Found
```cpp
return false;
```
- If the binary search completes without finding the target value, we return `false`, indicating that the target does not exist in the matrix.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(log(m * n))**: 
    - We perform a **binary search** on a 1D representation of the matrix with `m * n` elements.
    - The time complexity of binary search on a sequence of size `m * n` is `O(log(m * n))`.
    - Since `m * n` represents the total number of elements in the matrix, the time complexity simplifies to **O(log(m * n))**.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: 
    - The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space to store the pointers and the index calculations, making the space complexity **O(1)**.
    - The matrix is modified in place and no additional data structures are used for the search process.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently searches for the target element in a 2D matrix by utilizing **binary search** on a flattened 1D array representation of the matrix. By treating the matrix as a sequence of numbers, we can exploit the sorted order of both rows and columns to reduce the time complexity of searching. The algorithm provides an optimal solution with **O(log(m * n))** time complexity, making it highly efficient for large matrices. Additionally, with a **O(1)** space complexity, it avoids using extra memory, which is ideal for memory-constrained environments.

This approach demonstrates how leveraging sorting properties in data structures, such as matrices, can lead to significant improvements in search efficiency. By transforming the matrix into a form that is more suitable for binary search, we can achieve faster results and handle larger datasets effectively.
