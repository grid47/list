### Problem Statement
Given a 2D matrix `mtx` that is sorted in ascending order both row-wise and column-wise, and a target integer `target`, determine if `target` exists in the matrix.

### Approach
1. **Binary Search**: Treat the 2D matrix as a 1D array for the purpose of searching.
   - The matrix can be visualized as a single sorted array of size `m * n`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.

2. **Calculate Row and Column Indices**:
   - For a given mid index, calculate the corresponding row index (`rw`) and column index (`c`) using:
     - `rw = mid / n`
     - `c = mid % n`
   - This allows accessing the matrix elements using standard indexing.

3. **Search Logic**:
   - Perform a binary search:
     - If the value at the calculated mid index matches `target`, return `true`.
     - If the value is greater than `target`, adjust the right boundary (`r`).
     - If the value is less than `target`, adjust the left boundary (`l`).

4. **End Condition**:
   - If the search concludes without finding the target, return `false`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: Set the left (`l`) and right (`r`) pointers to cover the entire matrix.
2. **Loop**: Continue the search until the left pointer exceeds the right pointer.
3. **Mid Calculation**: Calculate the mid index and derive its corresponding row and column.
4. **Comparison**: Check the value at that index against the target and adjust pointers accordingly.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(\log(M \times N)) \), where \( M \) and \( N \) are the dimensions of the matrix.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \), since only a constant amount of extra space is used for variables.
