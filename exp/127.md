### Problem Statement
Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary of words, find the length of the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`. Each transformed word must exist in the dictionary, and only one letter can be changed at a time.

### Approach
1. **Initialize a Set**: Create an unordered map to store the words in the dictionary for quick lookup.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Use a queue to explore the words level by level.
   - Start by pushing `beginWord` into the queue.
   - Initialize a counter `cnt` to track the number of transformations.
3. **Process the Queue**:
   - While the queue is not empty, determine the number of words at the current level.
   - For each word:
     - Check if it matches `endWord`; if it does, return the count of transformations.
     - Remove the word from the dictionary to prevent re-processing.
     - Generate all possible single-letter transformations.
     - If the transformed word exists in the dictionary, push it onto the queue.
4. **Return 0**: If the queue is exhausted without finding `endWord`, return 0.

### Code Walk-through
- **`ladderLength` function**:
  - **Line 2-4**: Populate the dictionary map with words from the provided list.
  - **Line 6**: Initialize a queue and push the `beginWord`.
  - **Line 8**: Set a counter to keep track of the number of transformations.
  - **Line 9-19**: Process each word in the queue:
    - **Line 10**: Get the current level size.
    - **Line 11-17**: For each word, check if it matches `endWord` and generate transformations:
      - Change each character to all letters from 'a' to 'z' and check for valid words in the dictionary.
      - If a valid transformation is found, push it into the queue.
  - **Line 21**: Return 0 if no transformation sequence is found.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N \cdot M \cdot 26)\), where \(N\) is the number of words in the dictionary, \(M\) is the length of each word, and 26 represents the number of letters in the alphabet (for transformations).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for storing the words in the unordered map and the queue.
