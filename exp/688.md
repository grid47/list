### Problem Statement
Given an n x n chessboard and a knight positioned at `(row, col)`, the knight can make `k` moves. Your task is to determine the probability that the knight remains on the chessboard after making all `k` moves.

### Approach
The solution uses dynamic programming (DP) with memoization to efficiently compute the probability of the knight staying on the board after `k` moves. The main steps are:

1. **Define the Knight's Moves**: The knight can move in eight possible directions:
   - Two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.
   
2. **Memoization**: A 3D vector `memo` is used to store the computed probabilities for the state defined by the number of moves left, the current row, and the current column.

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - **Base Case**: If the knight moves out of bounds (i.e., `i` or `j` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to `n`), the probability is `0`. If `k` reaches `0`, it means the knight is still on the board, so the probability is `1`.
   - The function computes the probability recursively for each of the eight knight moves, summing their contributions, each multiplied by `0.125` (the probability of moving in any specific direction).

4. **Return Result**: The function `knightProbability` initializes the memoization structure and calls the recursive function.

### Code Walk-through
- The main function `knightProbability` initializes necessary variables and the memoization structure.
- The `dfs` function computes the probability recursively while checking for boundary conditions and memoized results.
- Each possible knight move is calculated and accumulated into the result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(K * N^2), where K is the number of moves and N is the size of the chessboard. Each state `(k, i, j)` is computed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(K * N^2) due to the memoization storage.

This efficient approach allows for calculating the knight's probability of staying on the chessboard after a set number of moves, using recursive exploration with caching to avoid redundant calculations.
