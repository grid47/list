### Problem Statement
Given a list of tasks represented by characters and an integer `n`, where each task must be executed with a cooldown period of `n` intervals between two same tasks, determine the least number of intervals required to finish all tasks.

### Approach
1. **Frequency Count**: Count the frequency of each task using a map.
2. **Priority Queue**: Use a max-heap (priority queue) to always fetch the task with the highest remaining frequency.
3. **Task Scheduling**:
   - In each cycle of size `n + 1`, try to execute the most frequent tasks available.
   - Decrease the frequency of each executed task.
   - If a task still has remaining executions, push it back into the heap.
   - If the heap is not empty after the cycle, it means we need to wait for the cooldown period (`n`) before the next batch of tasks can be executed.

4. **Calculate Time**: The total time taken is the sum of the intervals processed, including any necessary cooldowns.

### Code Walk-through
- Count the occurrences of each task and push them into a priority queue.
- Use a loop to simulate the scheduling of tasks in intervals.
- If tasks remain in the queue, continue processing them with respect to the cooldown period.
- The final count of intervals will be returned.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log K), where N is the number of tasks and K is the number of distinct tasks (size of the priority queue).
- **Space Complexity**: O(K) for the frequency map and the priority queue.
