### Problem Statement
The task is to count the number of contiguous subarrays of length `k` in a given integer array `arr` where the sum of the elements in each subarray is greater than or equal to a specified threshold value `th`. This problem requires efficient computation due to potentially large input sizes.

### Approach
To solve this problem, we can utilize a sliding window technique, which allows us to efficiently calculate the sum of each contiguous subarray of length `k` without having to compute the sum from scratch for every possible subarray. The approach can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Initialize Variables**: We will maintain a running sum for the current window of size `k` and a counter to track the number of valid subarrays that meet the threshold.

2. **Calculate Initial Sum**: Compute the sum of the first `k` elements in the array to establish a baseline for the sliding window.

3. **Slide the Window**: As we iterate through the array, we slide the window to the right by adding the next element and removing the first element of the previous window. After each adjustment, we check if the updated sum meets or exceeds the threshold.

4. **Count Valid Subarrays**: Increment the counter whenever the sum of the current window meets the threshold.

5. **Return the Count**: After iterating through the array, return the total count of valid subarrays.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfSubarrays(vector<int>& arr, int k, int th) {
```
- A class `Solution` is defined, containing the method `numOfSubarrays` which takes a vector of integers `arr`, an integer `k`, and an integer `th` as parameters.

```cpp
        int cnt = 0, sum = 0;
        th = th * k;
```
- Two integer variables `cnt` and `sum` are initialized to zero. The threshold `th` is multiplied by `k` to facilitate comparisons with the sum of the subarrays.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
```
- A loop runs from `0` to `k-1`, calculating the sum of the first `k` elements of the array. This initial sum serves as the starting point for the sliding window.

```cpp
        cnt += sum >= th;
```
- The counter `cnt` is incremented by one if the initial sum is greater than or equal to the threshold `th`. This checks if the first window is valid.

```cpp
        for(int i = k; i < arr.size(); i++) {
```
- A for-loop starts from the `k`-th index to iterate through the rest of the array, allowing us to slide the window.

```cpp
            sum += arr[i];
            sum -= arr[i - k];
```
- Inside the loop, the sum is updated by adding the current element `arr[i]` and subtracting the element that is left out of the window `arr[i - k]`.

```cpp
            if(sum >= th) cnt++;
```
- After updating the sum, we check if it meets the threshold condition. If it does, we increment the count.

```cpp
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
- Finally, the method returns the count of valid subarrays.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the size of the input array `arr`. The sliding window allows us to traverse the array with constant time updates for each element.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size, storing only a few integer variables.

### Conclusion
The provided code efficiently counts the number of contiguous subarrays of a specified length `k` that have a sum greater than or equal to a given threshold `th` using a sliding window technique. This approach minimizes the number of operations required, making it suitable for large datasets.

By leveraging the sliding window method, the algorithm maintains a competitive performance in both time and space, which is crucial in algorithm design and competitive programming scenarios. Understanding this technique can significantly enhance oneâ€™s problem-solving skills, especially in tasks involving contiguous subarrays or sequences.

This solution is not only optimal for the current problem but also applicable to various other problems involving sums of subarrays, highlighting the versatility and efficiency of the sliding window approach.
