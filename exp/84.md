### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `h` where each element represents the height of a bar in a histogram, find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed in the histogram.

### Approach
1. **Use of Stacks**:
   - Utilize two stacks to determine the left and right limits for each bar where it can extend without being obstructed by a taller bar.

2. **Left Limit Calculation**:
   - Iterate through the histogram from left to right.
   - For each bar, use a stack to find the nearest bar to the left that is shorter than the current bar. If no such bar exists, set the limit to -1.

3. **Right Limit Calculation**:
   - Iterate through the histogram from right to left.
   - Similar to the left limit, use a stack to find the nearest bar to the right that is shorter than the current bar. If no such bar exists, set the limit to the length of the histogram.

4. **Area Calculation**:
   - For each bar, calculate the area of the rectangle that can be formed using that bar as the shortest bar. The width is determined by the difference between the left and right limits.

5. **Find Maximum Area**:
   - Track the maximum area encountered during the area calculations.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Left Limit**:
   - Iterate over the heights to populate the `left` array, which contains the index of the nearest smaller bar to the left for each bar.

2. **Right Limit**:
   - Iterate in reverse to populate the `right` array with the index of the nearest smaller bar to the right for each bar.

3. **Area Calculation**:
   - For each bar, compute the area using the formula: `height[i] * (right[i] - left[i] - 1)` and update the maximum area.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \) since each bar is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \) for the `left` and `right` arrays.
