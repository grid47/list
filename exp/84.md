### Problem Statement

The problem is to find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed in a histogram. Given a histogram represented by an array of integers, where each integer corresponds to the height of a bar in the histogram, the goal is to compute the maximum rectangular area that can be formed within the histogram. The rectangle can be formed by selecting a range of bars in the histogram and calculating the area formed by the shortest bar in that range multiplied by the width of the range.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a stack-based approach, which helps in finding the nearest smaller bar to the left and right of each bar. This allows us to compute the maximum area for each bar in linear time. The idea behind this approach is:

1. **Finding Nearest Smaller Bars:**
   For each bar in the histogram, we need to calculate the nearest bar on the left and the nearest bar on the right that is smaller than the current bar. This gives us the range within which the current bar can contribute to the maximum area rectangle.
   
2. **Using a Stack to Track Indices:**
   We use a stack to store the indices of bars in the histogram. This stack helps in maintaining the order of the bars and allows us to efficiently find the nearest smaller bar to the left and right.

3. **Calculating Maximum Area:**
   For each bar, the maximum area that can be formed with that bar is the height of the bar multiplied by the width of the range between the nearest smaller bars on the left and right.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Finding Nearest Smaller Bar to the Left

```cpp
stack<int> stk;
int n = h.size();
vector<int> left(n, 0), right(n, 0);
for(int i = 0; i < h.size(); i++) {
    if(stk.empty()) {
        left[i] = -1;
        stk.push(i);
    } else {
        while(!stk.empty() && h[i] <= h[stk.top()])
            stk.pop();
        if(stk.empty())
            left[i] = -1;
        else left[i] = stk.top();
        stk.push(i);
    }
}
```

- A stack `stk` is used to store the indices of bars as we traverse the histogram from left to right.
- The array `left` stores the index of the nearest bar to the left that is smaller than the current bar. If no such bar exists, we assign `-1` to indicate the left boundary.
- For each bar, we pop elements from the stack while the current bar is smaller than or equal to the bar at the index stored at the top of the stack. This ensures that the stack only contains indices of bars that are taller than the current bar.
- The index of the nearest smaller bar is recorded in the `left` array.
- Finally, the current barâ€™s index is pushed onto the stack for future comparisons.

#### Step 2: Finding Nearest Smaller Bar to the Right

```cpp
while(!stk.empty()) stk.pop();
for(int i = h.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if(stk.empty()) {
        right[i] = n;
        stk.push(i);
    } else {
        while(!stk.empty() && h[i] <= h[stk.top()])
            stk.pop();
        if(stk.empty())
            right[i] = n;
        else right[i] = stk.top();
        stk.push(i);
    }
}
```

- After processing the left boundary, we reset the stack and traverse the histogram from right to left to find the nearest smaller bar on the right.
- The `right` array stores the index of the nearest bar to the right that is smaller than the current bar. If no such bar exists, we assign `n` (the size of the histogram) to indicate the right boundary.
- The approach is similar to the left boundary, but we now process the histogram in reverse order.
- The `right` array is populated similarly by pushing the index of the nearest smaller bar on the right.

#### Step 3: Calculating the Maximum Rectangle Area

```cpp
int res = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    res = max(res, h[i] * (right[i] - left[i] - 1));

return res;
```

- After calculating the left and right boundaries for each bar, we iterate over the histogram to compute the area for each bar.
- The area for each bar is computed as `height * width`, where:
  - `height` is the height of the current bar (`h[i]`).
  - `width` is the distance between the left and right boundaries, which is calculated as `right[i] - left[i] - 1`.
- We keep track of the maximum area encountered during the iteration and return it as the result.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Left and Right Boundary Calculation:** Both the left and right boundary calculations involve iterating over the histogram, and for each bar, we perform constant-time operations (push and pop from the stack). Thus, the time complexity for finding the left and right boundaries is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of bars in the histogram.
- **Area Calculation:** After calculating the boundaries, we perform a single pass over the histogram to calculate the area for each bar, which also takes `O(n)` time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is `O(n)`.

#### Space Complexity:
- We use two arrays (`left` and `right`) of size `n` to store the boundaries, and a stack that can hold up to `n` indices at most. Therefore, the space complexity is `O(n)`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution efficiently computes the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed in a histogram using a stack-based approach. By leveraging stacks to find the nearest smaller bars on the left and right for each bar, the algorithm computes the maximum rectangle area in linear time (`O(n)`). This approach is both time and space efficient, making it suitable for large input sizes. By using stack-based optimization, this solution avoids the brute-force approach of checking all possible rectangles, significantly improving performance. This makes the algorithm scalable and efficient for real-world applications involving histogram-based problems.
