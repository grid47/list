### Problem Statement
You are given a 2D integer matrix `M` representing the pixel values of an image. Your task is to apply an image smoothing algorithm. Each pixel value in the smoothed image is computed by averaging the values of the pixel itself and its neighbors, including diagonals. The result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Get the dimensions of the matrix (`m` and `n`).
   - Define the directions for neighboring pixels (8 possible directions).

2. **Iterate Through the Matrix**:
   - For each pixel at position `(i, j)`:
     - Initialize a `sum` with the value of the current pixel and a `cnt` (counter) starting from 1.
     - Check all 8 neighboring directions:
       - For each neighbor, calculate its coordinates.
       - If the neighbor is within bounds, add its value to `sum` and increment the `cnt`.
     - Calculate the average by dividing `sum` by `cnt` and store it in the original pixel position but shifted to the higher bits.

3. **Final Adjustment**:
   - After processing all pixels, shift the values back to the lower bits to get the final smoothed pixel values.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the modified matrix `M` with smoothed pixel values.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes the size of the matrix and the directions for neighbor checks.
2. **Nested Loops**: A double loop iterates through each pixel, applying the smoothing logic by checking neighboring pixels.
3. **Bit Manipulation**: The final results are adjusted using bit manipulation to ensure the average is stored and retrieved correctly.
4. **Return Statement**: The modified matrix is returned at the end.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix. Each pixel is processed independently.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since the smoothing is done in place without using extra space for a new matrix.
