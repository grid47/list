### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `d`, find the longest string in `d` that can be formed by deleting some characters of `s`. If there are multiple such longest strings, return the lexicographically smallest one. If there is no such string, return an empty string.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use a variable `ans` to store the longest valid word found so far.

2. **Iterate Through Dictionary**:
   - For each word in the dictionary `d`, check if it can be formed by deleting characters from `s`.

3. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Use two pointers, `pi` for string `s` and `pj` for the current word in `d`. 
   - Increment `pi` through `s`, and for every matching character with `d[pj]`, increment `pj`.

4. **Check Word Validity**:
   - If `pj` equals the length of the current word in `d`, it means the word can be formed from `s`.
   - Compare its length and lexicographical order with `ans` to potentially update `ans`.

5. **Return Result**:
   - After checking all words in `d`, return the longest valid word stored in `ans`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with an empty string `ans`.

2. **Check Each Word**:
   - For each word in `d`, check if it can be formed using the two-pointer technique.
   - Update `ans` whenever a longer or lexicographically smaller valid word is found.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where `n` is the number of words in `d` and `m` is the average length of words in `d`, as we potentially traverse the string `s` for each word.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of additional space.
