### Problem Statement:
In this problem, we are given a 2D grid representing a map of water and land. The grid contains values `1` representing land and `0` representing water. The task is to find the **maximum area of an island**. An island is defined as a group of connected `1`s (land), where land pieces are connected either horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).

We need to return the area of the largest island in the grid, where the area is defined as the total number of `1`s in the island.

### Approach:

This problem is essentially asking us to identify the largest connected component in the grid. We can break down the task using the following steps:

1. **Iterate Over the Grid**:
   We will iterate over each cell in the grid to check if the cell is land (`1`). If a land cell is found, it will be the starting point for a Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the entire island (all connected `1`s).

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   From each land cell, we will perform DFS to explore the connected land cells. The DFS will explore all four directions: up, down, left, and right. For each connected land cell found, we mark it as visited (by changing the cellâ€™s value from `1` to `2`) to avoid revisiting it in future searches.

3. **Track the Maximum Island Size**:
   For each DFS traversal, we calculate the area of the island (i.e., the number of connected land cells). The maximum area encountered during all DFS searches will be our result.

4. **Return the Largest Area**:
   After completing the DFS for all land cells in the grid, the maximum area found will be the size of the largest island.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step):

#### 1. **Main Function (`maxAreaOfIsland`)**:
```cpp
int mx = 0;
int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        if(grid[i][j] == 1)
            mx = max(mx, dfs(grid, i, j));
return mx;
```
- **`mx`** is initialized to `0` to store the maximum area of any island found.
- **`m` and `n`** are the dimensions of the grid (number of rows and columns).
- We iterate through every cell in the grid:
  - If a cell contains `1` (representing land), we start a DFS from that cell to find the size of the connected island.
  - We then compare the area of the island found with the current maximum (`mx`) and update it if necessary.
- Finally, we return the maximum area found.

#### 2. **Depth-First Search Function (`dfs`)**:
```cpp
int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int i, int j) {
    int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
    if(i < 0 || j < 0 || i == m || j == n || grid[i][j] != 1)
        return 0;
    int ans = 1;
    grid[i][j] = 2; // mark the current cell as visited
    ans += dfs(grid, i + 1, j); // explore down
    ans += dfs(grid, i, j + 1); // explore right
    ans += dfs(grid, i - 1, j); // explore up
    ans += dfs(grid, i, j - 1); // explore left
    return ans;
}
```
- The DFS function starts from the cell `(i, j)` and recursively explores all connected land cells.
- **Base Case**: If the current cell is out of bounds or is water (`0`), we return `0`, indicating no area can be added from this cell.
- We initialize **`ans`** to `1`, as we start with the current land cell.
- **Mark the cell as visited** by setting `grid[i][j] = 2` to ensure it is not revisited.
- The DFS then proceeds to explore in all four directions (down, right, up, left), adding the areas of all connected cells to `ans`.
- Finally, we return the total area of the island starting from `(i, j)`.

### Complexity:

#### Time Complexity:
- **Grid Traversal**: The main function iterates over each cell in the grid. This is an **O(m * n)** operation, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.
- **DFS Traversal**: In the worst case, every cell is visited exactly once. Since every DFS call explores a connected island and marks visited cells, the total time spent in DFS is also **O(m * n)**.
- The overall time complexity is **O(m * n)** because we traverse all cells in the grid and perform DFS for each unvisited land cell.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space for Grid**: The grid is modified in place by marking visited cells, so no additional space is required for storing the grid.
- **Recursive Call Stack**: In the worst case, the entire grid might be part of a single island, and the DFS recursion could go as deep as `O(m * n)` (for a very large island). Thus, the space complexity is **O(m * n)** due to the recursive stack used by the DFS function.

### Conclusion:
This solution effectively uses **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to explore the connected components (islands) in the grid and calculate their areas. By marking visited cells and recursively exploring all neighboring cells of land, we efficiently calculate the largest island area. The time complexity is **O(m * n)**, which ensures that the solution works efficiently even for large grids. The space complexity is **O(m * n)** due to the recursive stack, which is manageable for most inputs.
