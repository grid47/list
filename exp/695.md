### Problem Statement
You are given a 2D grid consisting of `0`s (water) and `1`s (land). An island is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. Your task is to find the maximum area of an island in the grid.

### Approach
1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `grid`: A 2D vector where each element is either `0` (water) or `1` (land).

2. **Initialization**:
   - Define a variable `mx` to keep track of the maximum area found.
   - Get the dimensions of the grid, `m` (rows) and `n` (columns).

3. **Iterate through the Grid**:
   - Use nested loops to traverse each cell in the grid.
   - For each cell that contains `1`, call the `dfs` function to compute the area of the island and update `mx` accordingly.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The `dfs` function takes the current cell's coordinates and returns the area of the island.
   - If the current cell is out of bounds or is not part of an island (`grid[i][j] != 1`), return `0`.
   - Mark the current cell as visited by changing its value to `2`.
   - Recursively call `dfs` on all four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) and accumulate the area.

### Code Walk-through
- The main function `maxAreaOfIsland` initializes the maximum area and iterates through the grid.
- When a land cell (`1`) is found, it invokes the `dfs` function to explore the entire island.
- The `dfs` function computes the area by marking visited cells and exploring their neighbors.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. Each cell is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) in the worst case for the recursion stack if the grid is completely filled with land.
