### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to find the number of distinct integers that can be generated by performing a specific operation on an integer `n`. The operation involves repeatedly subtracting 1 from the integer until it becomes 1. At each step, we can either subtract the current integer from itself or choose to subtract it using other operations. The goal is to determine how many distinct results are produced from these operations, given the number `n`.

### Approach

The problem presents a mathematical concept involving a sequence of operations, but it can be simplified into a straightforward pattern observation. The task can be broken down into understanding how many distinct results can be obtained after performing the subtraction operations starting from `n`.

- If `n` is either `1` or `2`, there is only one distinct result: `1` (in case of `n=1`) or `2` (in case of `n=2`).
- For any integer greater than `2`, the result of the operation will always involve subtracting smaller integers, and the number of distinct integers involved will be equal to `n-1` because we can obtain all the integers from 1 up to `n-1`.

Thus, the problem can be reduced to a simple conditional check based on the value of `n`:
- If `n == 1` or `n == 2`, the result is `1` because there's only one distinct value.
- For any integer `n > 2`, the result is `n - 1`, as this will give all the integers from `1` to `n-1` as distinct results.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Check if `n` is 1 or 2
```cpp
if(n == 1 || n == 2) return 1;
```
- This line checks whether the input `n` is either `1` or `2`.
- If `n` is `1` or `2`, we immediately return `1` because there is only one distinct integer that can be produced from the given number in this case.

#### Step 2: For values of `n` greater than 2
```cpp
return n - 1;
```
- If `n` is greater than `2`, we return `n - 1` because there are `n - 1` distinct integers between `1` and `n - 1`. These integers will be generated by the operation starting from `n`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The solution runs in **O(1)** time since it only involves checking the value of `n` and performing a simple conditional check. There are no loops or recursive calls, making the time complexity constant.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)** as the solution only uses a constant amount of space to store the result, and no additional data structures are required.

### Conclusion

This problem provides an efficient solution by utilizing simple mathematical observations. The key insight is that for any integer `n` greater than `2`, the number of distinct integers that can be generated from it is simply `n - 1`. For `n = 1` or `n = 2`, the result is `1`, as only one distinct value can be produced. The approach has constant time and space complexity, making it optimal for large inputs. 

The elegance of this solution lies in its simplicity. Rather than performing complex calculations or operations, we reduce the problem to a few simple conditions based on the input value, achieving an efficient and clear solution.
