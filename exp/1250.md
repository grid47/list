### Problem Statement
In this problem, you are given an array of integers `nums`. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to express the number `1` as a linear combination of the integers in the array. This means that there should exist non-negative integer coefficients \(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\) such that:

\[ x_1 \times nums[0] + x_2 \times nums[1] + ... + x_n \times nums[n-1] = 1 \]

If such coefficients exist, the array is considered a "good array." The task is to return `true` if the array is good (i.e., it can form the number `1`), or `false` otherwise.

### Approach
The key insight for solving this problem lies in the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD). The following steps outline the approach:

1. **Understanding GCD**: The array can represent the number `1` as a linear combination of its elements if and only if the GCD of all the elements in the array is `1`. If the GCD is greater than `1`, it means that all numbers share a common factor greater than `1`, making it impossible to form `1`.
  
2. **Calculate GCD**: We will iterate through the elements of the array, calculating the GCD of all elements using the built-in function `__gcd`, which computes the GCD of two integers.

3. **Check Result**: After computing the GCD of the entire array, we check if the result is equal to `1`. If it is, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isGoodArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int gcd = nums[0];
```
- **Lines 1-3**: We define the `Solution` class and declare the `isGoodArray` method, which takes a vector of integers `nums` as input. We initialize the `gcd` variable with the first element of the array. This will serve as the starting point for our GCD calculations.

```cpp
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++)
            gcd = __gcd(gcd, nums[i]);
```
- **Lines 4-6**: We enter a loop that starts from the second element of the array (index 1) and continues to the end of the array. For each element `nums[i]`, we compute the GCD of the current `gcd` value and the current element. The `__gcd` function efficiently computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.

```cpp
        return gcd == 1;
    }
};
```
- **Lines 7-9**: After iterating through all elements, we check if the final `gcd` is equal to `1`. If it is, we return `true`, indicating that the array is good. Otherwise, we return `false`.

### Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \( O(n \log m) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the `nums` array and \( m \) is the maximum value in the array. The \( \log m \) term comes from the GCD calculation using the Euclidean algorithm, which runs in logarithmic time relative to the values being processed.

2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \( O(1) \) since we are using a constant amount of extra space for variables (`gcd` and loop indices) regardless of the input size.

### Conclusion
The `isGoodArray` function efficiently determines if a given array can be classified as a "good array" by leveraging the mathematical properties of the greatest common divisor. By iterating through the array and calculating the GCD, the function provides a concise and optimal solution to the problem. This approach not only simplifies the problem but also ensures that the solution is scalable for larger inputs. 

In summary, this method is robust, straightforward, and leverages efficient built-in functions to achieve its goal. The importance of understanding GCD in the context of linear combinations highlights the interplay between number theory and algorithmic design, making this problem an excellent example of applying mathematical principles in computer science. 

Overall, the solution demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem requirements and effectively translates them into a working implementation, making it a valuable addition to any software development or competitive programming toolkit.
