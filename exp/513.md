### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, find the value of the bottom leftmost node. A node is considered the bottom left if it is the leftmost node in the lowest level of the tree.

### Approach
1. **Level Order Traversal**:
   - Utilize a queue to perform a level order traversal (BFS) of the binary tree.
   - At each level, keep track of the leftmost node.

2. **Iterate Through Levels**:
   - For each level, update the result with the front of the queue (the leftmost node).
   - Enqueue the children of the current node (left child first, then right child).

3. **Return Result**:
   - The last updated result after traversing all levels will be the bottom left value.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `findBottomLeftValue` function takes a pointer to the root of the binary tree.

2. **Queue Initialization**:
   - Initialize a queue and push the root node into it.

3. **Level Traversal**:
   - While the queue is not empty, get the size of the current level.
   - Update the result to the value of the first node in the current level.

4. **Node Processing**:
   - Process all nodes at the current level, enqueueing their left and right children if they exist.

5. **Final Output**:
   - Return the result, which holds the bottom left value of the tree.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree, due to the queue used for level order traversal.
