### Problem Statement
Given two arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, you need to rearrange `nums1` in such a way that for each element in `nums2`, the corresponding element in `nums1` is greater than the element in `nums2`. If there are no suitable elements, you should return the smallest available element from `nums1`.

### Approach
1. **Use a Multiset**: Store the elements of `nums1` in a multiset to allow for efficient access and removal of elements.
   
2. **Iterate through nums2**:
   - For each element in `nums2`, check if the largest element in `nums1` (`*s.rbegin()`) is less than or equal to the current element in `nums2`.
   - If it is, use the smallest element from `nums1` (`*s.begin()`).
   - Otherwise, use the smallest element in `nums1` that is greater than the current element in `nums2` using `s.upper_bound(nums2[i])`.

3. **Replace the Elements**: Replace the elements in `nums1` with the chosen elements based on the conditions above.

4. **Return Result**: Return the modified `nums1`.

### Code Walk-through
- A multiset `s` is initialized with the elements of `nums1`.
- For each element in `nums2`, the appropriate element from `nums1` is determined and assigned.
- The chosen element is then erased from the multiset to ensure it cannot be reused.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where \( n \) is the size of `nums1` (or `nums2`). This is due to the operations on the multiset, which involves logarithmic complexity for insertion, deletion, and access.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we store the elements of `nums1` in a multiset.
