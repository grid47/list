### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums`, find the "pivot index" of the array. The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the elements to the left of it is equal to the sum of all the elements to its right. If no such index exists, return -1.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Initialize `left` to 0, which will hold the sum of elements to the left of the current index.
   - Calculate the total sum of the array using `accumulate` and store it in `right`, which will represent the sum of elements to the right of the current index.

2. **Iterate Through Each Element**:
   - For each index `i` in the array:
     - Subtract the current element `nums[i]` from `right` to update the sum of elements on the right side.
     - Check if the updated `right` is equal to `left`. If they are equal, return the current index `i` as the pivot index.
     - Add the current element `nums[i]` to `left` to update the sum of elements on the left side.

3. **Return Result**:
   - If no pivot index is found after checking all elements, return -1.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function**:
  - `pivotIndex(vector<int>& nums)`: Finds the pivot index in the given array of integers.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the `nums` array, as we traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space for `left` and `right`.
