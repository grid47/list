### Problem Statement
The problem asks to replace each element in a given list of integers `nums` by checking whether the greatest common divisor (GCD) between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If so, these two elements should be merged into a single number which is the least common multiple (LCM) of the two. This process should continue until no such pairs exist, and the final list of numbers, after all replacements, should be returned.

### Approach
The problem revolves around efficiently merging elements in the list based on the GCD condition. The strategy is to:
1. Iterate over the numbers in the list.
2. For each number, check if the last two elements in the result list (stored in `ans`) are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1). If they are not coprime, replace them with their LCM.
3. Continue this process until no more replacements are possible and return the modified list.

The LCM of two numbers `a` and `b` can be computed using the formula:
\[ \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \]
This formula ensures that the resulting number is divisible by both `a` and `b` and is the smallest such number.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables
```cpp
int n = nums.size();
vector<int> ans;
```
- The size of the input vector `nums` is stored in `n`.
- A new vector `ans` is initialized to store the resulting numbers after replacements.

#### Step 2: Iterate Over Each Number in the List
```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ans.push_back(nums[i]);
```
- We iterate over each number in the `nums` list. For each number, we add it to the `ans` list.

#### Step 3: Check for Coprimeness Between Consecutive Elements
```cpp
while(ans.size() > 1 && __gcd(ans.back(), ans[ans.size() - 2]) > 1) {
    long long a = ans.back(),
        b = ans[ans.size() - 2];
    ans.pop_back();
    ans.pop_back();
    ans.push_back(a * b / __gcd(a, b));
}
```
- After adding the current number from `nums`, we check if the last two numbers in `ans` have a GCD greater than 1.
- If they do, they are not coprime, and we merge them by calculating their LCM. We first pop the last two elements from `ans` and then push the LCM of the two numbers back into `ans`.
- The LCM is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
  \]
  The LCM ensures that the new number is the smallest number divisible by both `a` and `b`.

#### Step 4: Return the Final List
```cpp
return ans;
```
- After processing all the numbers in `nums` and merging non-coprime pairs, the final `ans` list is returned, which contains the merged results.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the `nums` list. The reason is:
  - We iterate over each number once.
  - For each number, we check at most two numbers in the result list `ans` (the last two numbers).
  - The GCD operation, which is the most expensive part of the inner `while` loop, takes logarithmic time in the value of the numbers being checked. However, since the list only reduces in size as numbers are merged, the number of iterations in the while loop is proportional to the number of numbers being processed. Hence, the overall complexity remains linear.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the `nums` list. This space is used to store the result list `ans`, which contains the final sequence of numbers after the replacements.

### Conclusion
This solution efficiently handles the problem of merging numbers based on their GCD by maintaining a result list and continuously merging non-coprime pairs into their least common multiple (LCM). The approach works by:
1. Iterating over the numbers.
2. Using the GCD function to check coprimeness.
3. Repeatedly merging numbers when their GCD is greater than 1 until no further merges are possible.

By using the formula for LCM and employing efficient data structures such as vectors and utilizing the GCD function, the solution achieves optimal time and space complexities for this problem.

This approach ensures that all replacements are handled correctly, and the final sequence respects the rules of merging based on GCD, which is crucial for problems involving number theory and optimization.

Additionally, the solution is scalable to larger inputs due to its linear time complexity. This makes it ideal for scenarios where large datasets need to be processed efficiently without performance degradation.
