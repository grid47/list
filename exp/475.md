### Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays: `home` representing the positions of homes and `warm` representing the positions of warmers. Your goal is to find the minimum radius such that all homes are covered by at least one warmer.

### Approach
1. **Sorting**:
   - Sort both `home` and `warm` arrays. This allows us to efficiently find the closest warmer for each home.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `h` for homes and `w` for warmers, and an array `res` to store the minimum distances (radii) for each home.

3. **Left to Right Pass**:
   - Iterate through the homes using the `h` pointer. For each home, if the current warmer's position is greater than or equal to the home's position, calculate the distance from the home to the warmer and update `res[h]`.
   - If the warmer's position is less than the home's position, move the warmer pointer forward to find the closest warmer.

4. **Right to Left Pass**:
   - Repeat the process but in reverse. Start from the last home and the last warmer and check the distance in the opposite direction. Update `res[h]` with the minimum distance found.

5. **Result**:
   - The maximum value in the `res` array will be the minimum radius needed to cover all homes.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `findRadius()` takes two vectors of integers as inputs.

2. **Finding Minimum Distances**:
   - The code uses two passes to calculate the minimum distance for each home to the nearest warmer.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the maximum distance from the `res` array, which represents the minimum radius required.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m log m + n log n), where `m` is the number of homes and `n` is the number of warmers due to sorting. The two-pointer traversal is O(m + n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(m) for the `res` array.
