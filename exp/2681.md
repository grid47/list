### Problem Statement

The task is to calculate the sum of powers for a given list of integers. The goal is to compute the sum of the following expression for each element in the array:

\[
\text{sumOfPower} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} ( \text{sum of all previous numbers} + \text{current number} ) \times \text{current number}^2
\]

Given an integer array `nums`, the result should be calculated modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow. The solution needs to be optimized for both time and space complexity.

### Approach

To solve the problem efficiently, we can break it down into several steps:

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array allows us to process the numbers from the smallest to the largest. This helps in leveraging cumulative sums for efficient calculation.

2. **Iterating Through the Sorted Array**: We will compute the sum of powers incrementally while keeping track of a running sum of the array's elements. This avoids recalculating sums multiple times, which reduces time complexity.

3. **Using Modular Arithmetic**: Since the numbers in the result can grow large, we compute the sum and intermediate results modulo \(10^9 + 7\), as required by the problem statement.

4. **Efficient Computation of Powers**: For each element in the array, we calculate its contribution to the sum using the formula:
   \[
   (\text{sum of previous numbers} + \text{current number}) \times (\text{current number})^2
   \]
   We accumulate the result as we go, keeping track of the sum of all previous numbers to minimize redundant computations.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Sort the Array

```cpp
sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
```

- **Sorting**: The array `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order. Sorting helps ensure that we can accumulate the sum in an orderly fashion, making use of previously calculated results without having to recompute them.

#### Step 2: Initialize Variables

```cpp
int n = nums.size();
long long res = 0, sum = 0, mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
```

- **n**: We store the size of the `nums` array.
- **res**: This variable will store the final result. It is initialized to 0.
- **sum**: This variable will keep track of the cumulative sum of elements processed so far. It is initialized to 0.
- **mod**: The modulus value \(10^9 + 7\) is defined as `mod`, which will be used to take the modulo of the results to prevent overflow.

#### Step 3: Iterate Over the Array

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    res = (res + (sum + nums[i]) * nums[i] % mod * nums[i]) % mod;
    sum = (sum * 2 + nums[i]) % mod;
}
```

- **Loop**: The `for` loop iterates through each element in the sorted `nums` array.
  - **res**: For each element `nums[i]`, we calculate its contribution to the sum of powers using the formula:
    \[
    \text{contribution} = (\text{sum} + \text{nums[i]}) \times \text{nums[i]}^2
    \]
    We add this to the `res` variable and take modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow.
  - **sum**: After calculating the contribution of `nums[i]`, we update the cumulative sum. The `sum` is updated to include the current element `nums[i]`, and it's also multiplied by 2 to account for the fact that each element's sum gets doubled with each subsequent iteration. We take modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to avoid overflow.

#### Step 4: Return the Result

```cpp
return res % mod;
```

- **Final Result**: After the loop, `res` will contain the sum of powers for all elements in the array. The result is returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The time complexity of sorting the array is **O(n \log n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- **Iterating Over the Array**: The `for` loop iterates over the array once, performing constant-time operations for each element. This gives a time complexity of **O(n)**.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, so it is **O(n \log n)**.

#### Space Complexity

- **Auxiliary Space**: The space complexity is **O(1)** because we only use a constant amount of extra space (besides the input array). The space for storing `res`, `sum`, and `mod` does not depend on the size of the input.

- **Overall Space Complexity**: **O(1)**, constant space usage.

### Conclusion

The solution efficiently calculates the sum of powers for a given array using sorting and cumulative sums. By iterating through the sorted array and leveraging previously calculated results, we avoid redundant calculations and achieve a time complexity of **O(n \log n)**. This solution is optimal and works well for large input sizes.
