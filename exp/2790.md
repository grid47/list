### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find the maximum number of increasing groups that can be formed from an array of integers, where the elements of the array are used in the groups such that the size of each group is strictly increasing, and each element can only be used once. The key here is that the groups should form a strictly increasing sequence in terms of the number of elements in the groups, and the sum of all the elements of each group should be as balanced as possible to maximize the number of such increasing groups.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. **Sorting the Input Array**:
   - The first step in the solution is to sort the array in ascending order. This allows us to deal with the smallest elements first and attempt to form groups starting from the smallest possible group size.
   
2. **Greedy Group Formation**:
   - We then aim to form increasing groups, where the first group contains one element, the second group contains two elements, the third group contains three elements, and so on.
   - For each group, we keep track of the sum of its elements, ensuring that the sum of the elements can fulfill the requirements for the next group.

3. **Binary Search to Find Maximum Number of Groups**:
   - To efficiently find the largest possible number of increasing groups, we perform binary search. This will help determine the maximum number of groups that can be formed, as we check for the feasibility of forming a certain number of groups.

4. **Priority Queue for Efficient Calculation**:
   - To facilitate the formation of valid groups, a priority queue (max-heap) is used to manage the remaining elements efficiently during each group formation. This allows us to always pick the largest available element to form the current group.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
bool possible(vector<int>& nums, int x) {
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>> pq;
    int n = nums.size();
    for(int x: nums) pq.push(x);  // Fill the priority queue with elements from nums.
    int cur = 0;  // To track the current element in the group.
    
    while(x > 0) {
        int req = x;  // Required sum for the current group.
        while(req > 0) {
            if(cur == 0) {
                if(pq.empty()) return false;  // If the queue is empty, it's not possible.
                cur = min(x, pq.top());  // Get the maximum element to start the group.
                pq.pop();  // Remove the used element.
            }
            
            int ded = min(req, cur);  // Deduct the required sum from the current group.
            req -= ded;  // Update the remaining required sum for the group.

            if(req == 0 && ded < cur) {
                // If the current group is finished, reset cur.
            }
            cur -= ded;  // Reduce the current element.
        }
        x--;  // Decrease the group size.
    }
    return true;  // Return true if the group formation is possible.
}
```

- The `possible` function checks whether it's possible to form `x` increasing groups from the array.
- It uses a priority queue (max-heap) to efficiently manage the largest available elements for each group. It tries to allocate elements to each group in descending order of their values and ensures the groups' sums meet the criteria.

```cpp
int dump(vector<int>& nums) {
    sort(nums.rbegin(), nums.rend());  // Sort the array in descending order.
    int n = nums.size();
    int l = 1, r = n, ans = 1;

    while(l <= r) {
        int mid = l + (r - l + 1) / 2;  // Find the middle value for binary search.

        if(possible(nums, mid)) {  // Check if it's possible to form `mid` groups.
            ans = mid;  // If possible, update the answer.
            l = mid + 1;  // Look for more groups.
        } else {
            r = mid - 1;  // Look for fewer groups.
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```

- The `dump` function uses binary search to determine the maximum number of increasing groups that can be formed.
- It checks for each possible number of groups using the `possible` function and narrows down the range using binary search to find the optimal result.

```cpp
int maxIncreasingGroups(vector<int>& nums) {
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());  // Sort the input array.
    long bar = 0, net = 0;
    
    for(int x: nums) {
        net += x;  // Accumulate the total sum of elements.
        if(net >= ((bar + 1) * (bar + 2) / 2))  // Check if we can form the next group.
            bar++;  // Increase the number of groups.
    }
    return bar;  // Return the maximum number of increasing groups.
}
```

- The main function `maxIncreasingGroups` sorts the array and tries to form groups incrementally.
- It accumulates the sum of the elements and checks if it can form the next group by comparing the sum with the required sum for the next group size.
- Once the groups are formed, it returns the maximum number of increasing groups that can be created.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- Sorting the input array takes **O(n log n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- The binary search in the `dump` function runs in **O(log n)** time.
- The operations inside the `possible` function are linear with respect to the size of the array, making the time complexity of `possible` **O(n)**.
- Overall, the time complexity of the solution is dominated by the sorting step, resulting in **O(n log n)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the input array, due to the additional storage required for sorting and the priority queue used in the `possible` function.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the maximum number of increasing groups that can be formed from the input array. By utilizing sorting and binary search along with a priority queue, it effectively handles the task of group formation while ensuring optimal performance. The solution is well-suited for scenarios where the input size is large, as it operates with a time complexity of **O(n log n)**.
