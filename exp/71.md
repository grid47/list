### Problem Statement
Given a string representing an absolute path for a file, simplify it. The path may contain `.` (current directory), `..` (parent directory), and multiple slashes. Return the simplified canonical path.

### Approach
1. **Tokenization**: Split the input string `path` by the '/' delimiter to extract individual components (directories).
2. **Stack Usage**: Utilize a stack to manage the directories:
   - **Push Valid Directories**: Push directory names onto the stack if they are not empty, `.` (current directory), or `..` (parent directory). If encountering `..`, pop the last directory from the stack if it exists.
3. **Reconstruction**: After processing all components, reconstruct the simplified path by concatenating elements from the stack.
4. **Final Adjustment**: Return the simplified path, ensuring it returns "/" if the result is empty.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: A set `dot` is created to define characters that should be ignored. A string stream `ss` is initialized with the `path`.
2. **Processing**: A loop reads components from `ss`:
   - If the component is `..`, pop from the stack if not empty.
   - If it's valid (not in `dot`), push it onto the stack.
3. **Building Result**: After processing, the stack is used to build the resulting path by prepending each component.
4. **Output**: If the result is empty, return "/", otherwise return the constructed path.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(N) \), where \( N \) is the length of the input path, as each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(N) \), in the worst case, for the stack to store the directory components.
