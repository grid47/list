### ðŸ§³ **Simplifying Absolute File Paths**

The problem requires simplifying an absolute file path, given as a string, to its canonical form. For instance, given a path like `/a/./b/../../c/`, the canonical path should be `/c`. The simplification should remove redundant components, including:
- Single dots (`.`) representing the current directory.
- Double dots (`..`) representing moving up to the parent directory.
- Extra slashes (`/`) treated as a single separator.

### ðŸ§  **Approach**

This solution uses a **stack-based approach** to process each component in the path. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialize Set for Skipping Components**:
   - We define a set `dot` containing values `{"..", ".", ""}` to identify parts of the path that should be ignored or handled specifically:
     - The empty string (`""`) handles consecutive slashes.
     - `"."` represents the current directory, which can be ignored.
     - `".."` means moving up one directory.

2. **Tokenize the Path**:
   - A `stringstream` splits the `path` string by each `/` delimiter. Each extracted component is stored in `tmp`, which is then examined to check if itâ€™s a directory or a special token (`..`, `.`, or empty).

3. **Process Each Component Using a Stack**:
   - For each component `tmp`:
     - If `tmp` is `".."`, we move up one directory by popping the top element from the stack (unless the stack is empty).
     - If `tmp` is not in the `dot` set (i.e., it's a valid directory), we push it onto the stack.
   - At the end of this loop, the stack contains the simplified sequence of directories.

4. **Construct the Result**:
   - We pop each element from the stack and prepend it to `res` with a `/` to rebuild the canonical path.
   - If `res` is empty after processing, return `/`, representing the root directory.

### ðŸ’» **Code Breakdown**

#### Step 1: Initialize the Set, Stream, and Stack

```cpp
set<string> dot = {"..", ".", ""};
string res = "", tmp;
stringstream ss(path);
stack<string> stk;
```
- `dot` helps manage special path components like `".."`, `"."`, and empty strings.
- `res` will store the final canonical path.
- `tmp` holds each part of the path as we process it.
- `stk` manages directories as we build the simplified path.

#### Step 2: Process the Path Using `stringstream` and Stack

```cpp
while(getline(ss, tmp, '/')) {
    if(tmp == ".." && !stk.empty()) stk.pop();
    else if (!dot.count(tmp)) stk.push(tmp);
}
```
- We iterate through each part of `path`, splitting by `/`.
- If `tmp` is `".."` and the stack isn't empty, we pop from the stack (move up one directory).
- If `tmp` is not in the `dot` set (i.e., itâ€™s a valid directory name), we push it onto the stack.

#### Step 3: Construct the Result from the Stack

```cpp
while(!stk.empty()) {
    res = "/" + stk.top() + res;
    stk.pop();
}
return res == ""? "/": res;
```
- We construct the result path by adding each directory to `res`, ensuring each one is prefixed by `/`.
- If `res` is empty after processing, we return `/`, indicating the root directory.

### ðŸ“Š **Complexity Analysis**

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We process each part of the input `path` string once, and stack operations (push and pop) take constant time.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We use a stack to store the directories, which can hold all directories in the worst case.

### ðŸŒŸ **Conclusion**

This stack-based approach efficiently simplifies absolute file paths. It ensures that `..` correctly backtracks, and valid directories are added to the canonical path. This method is optimal for problems involving hierarchical paths and is especially suitable for file system path simplification.
