### Problem Statement

The problem "Profitable Schemes" is about finding the number of profitable schemes that can be formed under certain constraints. A "scheme" is defined as a set of operations where each operation consists of two parts: a group of people working on the scheme and a profit they generate.

Given the following parameters:
- `n`: The total number of people available for schemes.
- `mnp`: The minimum profit that needs to be generated.
- `group`: An array where `group[i]` is the number of people required for the `i-th` scheme.
- `profit`: An array where `profit[i]` is the profit generated by the `i-th` scheme.

We need to determine the number of ways to form schemes such that:
- The total number of people does not exceed `n`.
- The total profit generated is at least `mnp`.

The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Approach

This problem is a variant of the **0/1 Knapsack Problem** and can be solved using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. We will define a DP table that keeps track of the number of ways to form a scheme with a certain number of people and profit.

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We will maintain a DP table where each entry represents the number of ways to form a scheme given a certain number of people and profit.
2. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the number of schemes can be large, the answer will be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. **Optimization**: The problem involves two constraints: the number of people (`n`) and the profit (`mnp`). We need to ensure both constraints are satisfied while calculating the possible schemes.

#### Plan:
1. **DP Table**: Define a DP table `dp[i][j]` where:
   - `i`: The number of people used in the scheme.
   - `j`: The profit generated by the scheme.
   - `dp[i][j]`: The number of ways to form a scheme using exactly `i` people and generating `j` profit.
   
2. **Base Case**: We initialize `dp[0][0] = 1`, indicating that there is one way to form a scheme with 0 people and 0 profit (i.e., no scheme at all).

3. **State Transitions**: For each scheme, we update the DP table by considering each scheme's people and profit:
   - For every possible combination of people and profit, we check if adding this scheme would form a valid new scheme by incrementing the DP state.

4. **Result Calculation**: Once we fill the DP table, the final result will be the sum of all schemes that generate a profit of at least `mnp` using up to `n` people.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
    
    int profitableSchemes(int n, int mnp, vector<int>& group, vector<int>& profit) {
        // DP table: dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to use exactly i people
        // and generate j profit.
        vector<vector<int>> dp(mnp + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        
        // Base case: 1 way to use 0 people and generate 0 profit (do nothing)
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        
        // Process each scheme
        for(int k = 0; k < profit.size(); k++) {
            int p = profit[k], g = group[k];  // Profit and group size of current scheme
            
            // Update DP table from right to left to avoid overwriting the previous states
            for(int i = mnp; i >= 0; i--)  // Iterate over profit
            for(int j = n - g; j >= 0; j--)  // Iterate over people
                dp[min(i + p, mnp)][j + g] = (dp[min(i + p, mnp)][j + g] + dp[i][j]) % mod;
        }
        
        // Calculate the final result by summing up all schemes with profit >= mnp
        int ret = 0;
        for(int x: dp[mnp]) ret = (ret + x) % mod;
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Variables**:
   - `mod`: This is the modulus \(10^9 + 7\), which is used to ensure that the results are within bounds.
   - `dp`: A 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` holds the number of ways to form a scheme using exactly `i` people and generating `j` profit.
   - `group`: An array containing the number of people required for each scheme.
   - `profit`: An array containing the profit generated by each scheme.

2. **Base Case**:
   - We start by setting `dp[0][0] = 1`, which means there is 1 way to form a scheme with 0 people and 0 profit (by doing nothing).

3. **Main DP Transitions**:
   - The main part of the algorithm processes each scheme and updates the DP table accordingly. For each scheme:
     - We loop backward through the DP table to avoid overwriting the states for the current iteration.
     - For each possible number of people and profit, we check if we can include the current scheme and update the DP table for the new number of people and profit.
     - The new profit is bounded by `min(i + p, mnp)` to avoid exceeding the target minimum profit `mnp`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - After processing all schemes, the result is the sum of all schemes that generate a profit of at least `mnp`. This is done by iterating through `dp[mnp]` and adding up all the values.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- The outer loop iterates over the number of schemes, which is `O(K)` where `K` is the size of the `group` array.
- The inner loops iterate over the number of people (`n`) and the number of profits (`mnp`). This gives a time complexity of `O(n * mnp)` for each scheme.
- Overall, the time complexity is **O(K * n * mnp)** where `K` is the number of schemes, `n` is the number of people, and `mnp` is the minimum required profit.

#### Space Complexity:
- The DP table has dimensions `[mnp + 1][n + 1]`, so the space complexity is **O(mnp * n)**.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the number of profitable schemes using dynamic programming and memoization. By iterating over all possible schemes and updating the DP table, we ensure that we account for all possible combinations of people and profit in an optimal way. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that we handle large numbers efficiently, returning the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

- **Time Complexity**: O(K * n * mnp), where `K` is the number of schemes, `n` is the number of people, and `mnp` is the minimum required profit.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * mnp), due to the DP table.

This approach provides an optimal solution to the "Profitable Schemes" problem by leveraging dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of valid schemes.
