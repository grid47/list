### Problem Statement
Given `n` workers, a list of `group` sizes, and their corresponding `profit`, we want to determine the number of different schemes that can be profitable. Each scheme requires a certain number of workers and results in a certain profit. The goal is to calculate the number of ways to create profitable schemes that result in at least `mnp` profit.

### Approach
The problem can be solved using **dynamic programming**. We'll use a 2D DP array to track the number of ways to achieve different profit levels with a given number of workers.

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - We define a DP table `dp[i][j]` where:
     - `i` is the total profit level (from 0 to `mnp`).
     - `j` is the number of workers used (from 0 to `n`).
   - `dp[i][j]` will store the number of schemes that can achieve a profit of `i` using exactly `j` workers.

2. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize `dp[0][0] = 1`, which means there is one way to achieve a profit of 0 with 0 workers (by not doing any schemes).

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each scheme defined by the size of the group and its profit:
     - Update the DP table in reverse to avoid counting the same scheme multiple times.
     - For each profit level from `mnp` down to the profit of the current scheme, and for each worker count from `n` down to the size of the current group, update the DP values using:
       \[
       dp[\min(i + p, mnp)][j + g] += dp[i][j]
       \]
     - We use modulo `mod` to keep the numbers manageable.

4. **Final Count**:
   - The result is the sum of all schemes that achieve at least `mnp` profit. This is found by summing up `dp[mnp]` (the last row of the DP table).

### Code Walk-through
- The `profitableSchemes` function initializes the DP table and fills it based on the provided groups and profits.
- Finally, it computes the total number of profitable schemes and returns the result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(mnp \cdot g) \), where \( g \) is the number of schemes since for each scheme we process profit levels up to `mnp` and workers up to `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(mnp) \), for the DP table.
