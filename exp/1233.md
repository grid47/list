### Problem Statement
The task is to take a list of folder paths and return a new list containing only the folder paths that do not contain any subfolders. A folder path is represented as a string, and subfolders are defined as any folder whose path starts with another folder's path followed by an additional forward slash (`/`). For example, if we have the folders `/a`, `/a/b`, and `/c`, then `/a/b` is a subfolder of `/a` and should not be included in the result.

### Approach
To solve this problem, we can utilize a Trie (prefix tree) data structure to efficiently store and manage the folder paths. The basic idea is to insert each folder path into the Trie and check if the current path is a subfolder of any previously inserted paths. The Trie will help us easily navigate through the folder structure and identify subfolders.

1. **Sort the Folder Paths**: First, we sort the folder paths. This ensures that when we insert them into the Trie, any potential subfolder will be placed directly after its parent folder, making it easier to identify and ignore subfolders during insertion.

2. **Use a Trie for Insertion**: We implement a Trie where each node represents a character in a folder path. When inserting a new folder path, we traverse the Trie:
   - If we encounter a node that indicates the end of a previously added folder (meaning the current folder is a subfolder), we stop the insertion process and do not add the subfolder to the result.
   - If we finish inserting the entire path without encountering such a node, we add it to the result.

3. **Return the Result**: After processing all folder paths, we return the collected folder paths that are not subfolders.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class TrieNode {
    vector<TrieNode*> letter;
    bool main;
public:
    TrieNode (bool m) {
        letter.resize(27, NULL);
        main = m;
    }
```
- **Lines 1-7**: The `TrieNode` class is defined. It contains a vector of pointers to its children (representing the letters in the folder names) and a boolean indicating if the node represents the end of a main folder.

```cpp
    bool add(string key) {
        TrieNode* root = this;
        for (int i = 1; i < key.size(); i++) {
            int nxt;
            if (key[i] == '/') nxt = 26;  // Using index 26 for '/'
            else                       nxt = key[i] - 'a'; // Convert char to index

            if (root->letter[nxt] == NULL) {
                if(nxt != 26) root->letter[nxt] = new TrieNode(false);
                else {
                    if (root->main) return false; // Encountering a subfolder
                    root->letter[nxt] = new TrieNode(false);
                }
            }
            root = root->letter[nxt];
        }
```
- **Lines 8-23**: The `add` method is defined for the `TrieNode` class, which handles inserting a folder path into the Trie.
  - We iterate through each character of the folder path starting from the second character (since the first character is always `/`).
  - The `nxt` variable determines the index of the current character. If it's a forward slash, it uses index 26.
  - If the current character path does not exist in the Trie, we create a new node. If we hit an existing node that marks the end of a folder and we are trying to add a subfolder, we return false, indicating that the current path is a subfolder.

```cpp
        if(!root->main) {
            root->main = true; // Mark this node as a main folder
            root->letter.resize(27, NULL);
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
- **Lines 24-30**: After traversing the entire path, we check if the node does not already represent a main folder. If not, we mark it as a main folder and return true, indicating successful insertion.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> removeSubfolders(vector<string>& folder) {
        sort(folder.begin(), folder.end());
```
- **Lines 31-33**: The `Solution` class is defined, and the `removeSubfolders` method is declared. The folder paths are sorted to ensure parent folders come before their subfolders.

```cpp
        vector<string> ans;
        TrieNode* root = new TrieNode(false);
        for(int i = 0; i < folder.size(); i++) {
            if(root->add(folder[i]))
                ans.push_back(folder[i]);
        }
```
- **Lines 34-39**: A vector `ans` is initialized to store the resulting folder paths. A new Trie root node is created. We then iterate through each folder, attempting to add it to the Trie. If the folder is successfully added (i.e., it's not a subfolder), it gets pushed onto the result vector.

```cpp
        return ans;
    }
};
```
- **Lines 40-42**: After processing all folders, the method returns the vector containing only the valid folders (non-subfolders).

### Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \( O(n \cdot m) \), where \( n \) is the number of folder paths and \( m \) is the average length of the folder paths. Sorting takes \( O(n \log n) \), and inserting each folder path into the Trie takes linear time relative to the path length.

2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \( O(n \cdot m) \) due to the storage required for the Trie, which may hold a significant number of nodes based on the input folder paths.

### Conclusion
The `removeSubfolders` function efficiently removes subfolders from a list of folder paths using a Trie data structure. By sorting the folder paths and leveraging the properties of the Trie, the solution ensures that only main directories are retained. This approach is optimal in terms of time and space, making it suitable for handling a large number of folder paths in real-world applications. The implementation highlights the power of using data structures to solve complex problems efficiently and elegantly.
