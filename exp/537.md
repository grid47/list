### Problem Statement
Given two complex numbers represented as strings in the format "real+imaginaryi", implement a function to multiply the two complex numbers and return the result as a string in the same format.

### Approach
1. **Parsing the Input**:
   - Extract the real and imaginary parts from both complex numbers using string manipulation.
   - Split the strings on the '+' character to separate the real and imaginary components.

2. **Convert to Integers**:
   - Convert the parsed string components of the real and imaginary parts to integers for calculations.

3. **Multiplication Formula**:
   - Use the formula for multiplying two complex numbers:
     \[
     (a + bi) \times (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
     \]
   - Here, `a` and `b` are the real and imaginary parts of the first complex number, and `c` and `d` are the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number.

4. **Formatting the Result**:
   - Construct the resulting complex number as a string in the required format.

### Code Walk-through
- Initialize variables to store the real and imaginary parts for both complex numbers.
- Use loops and string methods to extract and convert parts of the input strings.
- Apply the multiplication formula to get the real and imaginary results.
- Return the formatted result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input strings, as we need to traverse the strings to extract components.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the integer storage, excluding the space used for the input and output strings.
