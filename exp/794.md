### Problem Statement
Determine whether a given Tic-Tac-Toe board configuration is valid. A board configuration is valid if it adheres to the rules of the game regarding player turns and win conditions.

### Approach
1. **Count Player Moves**:
   - Track the number of 'X's and 'O's on the board to ensure that the game has progressed correctly according to the turn rules.
   - Use two counters for the rows and columns of the board, along with counters for the two diagonals.

2. **Check for Wins**:
   - Check if either player has won by examining all rows, columns, and the two diagonals.
   - A win for 'X' is indicated by a row, column, or diagonal summing to 3, while a win for 'O' is indicated by summing to -3.

3. **Validate Game State**:
   - Ensure the number of 'X's is either equal to or one more than the number of 'O's since 'X' always goes first.
   - If 'X' has won, there should be no further 'O' moves, and if 'O' has won, 'X' should not have played after 'O'.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method for validating the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
    - `bool validTicTacToe(vector<string>& board)`: Checks if the board state is valid.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `board`: A vector of strings representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
      - **Returns**: `true` if the board is valid, otherwise `false`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as the board size is fixed (3x3).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only a constant amount of space is used for variables.
