### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to determine whether a given chessboard square is white or black based on its coordinates. The chessboard is traditionally arranged in an 8x8 grid, where the columns are labeled with letters from 'a' to 'h' and the rows are numbered from '1' to '8'. The objective is to find out whether the square corresponding to a given coordinate, represented as a string (for example, "a1", "h8", etc.), is white or black.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can utilize the properties of the chessboard's arrangement:

1. **Chessboard Coloring Pattern**: On a standard chessboard:
   - Squares with coordinates where the sum of the row and column indices is even are black.
   - Squares with coordinates where the sum is odd are white.
   
2. **Mapping Coordinates**: 
   - The column ('a' to 'h') can be converted to numerical indices by treating 'a' as 1, 'b' as 2, and so forth up to 'h' as 8.
   - The row ('1' to '8') is already numerical, ranging from 1 to 8.
   
3. **Determine Color**: To determine the color of a square, we can calculate the sum of its numerical column and row indices. If the result is odd, the square is white; if even, the square is black.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
```
- We define a class `Solution` that will contain our method for solving the problem.

```cpp
    bool squareIsWhite(string cord) {
```
- This method, `squareIsWhite`, takes a string parameter `cord` which represents the coordinates of the square on the chessboard. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the square is white.

```cpp
        int x = cord[0] - 'a' + 1;
```
- We begin by determining the numerical value for the column:
  - `cord[0]` accesses the first character of the string, which represents the column (e.g., 'a', 'b').
  - By subtracting 'a' from `cord[0]` and adding 1, we convert the letter to a corresponding numerical index:
    - 'a' becomes 1
    - 'b' becomes 2
    - ...
    - 'h' becomes 8

```cpp
        x += cord[1] - '0';
```
- Next, we determine the numerical value for the row:
  - `cord[1]` accesses the second character, which is a digit from '1' to '8'.
  - By subtracting '0', we convert the character to its integer representation directly (e.g., '1' becomes 1, '2' becomes 2, and so on).

```cpp
        return x % 2;
```
- Finally, we check if the sum of the column and row indices is odd or even:
  - The expression `x % 2` returns `true` if the sum is odd (indicating the square is white) and `false` if even (indicating the square is black).
- The method then returns the result of this evaluation.

```cpp
    }
};
```
- The class and method definitions are closed.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) since the method performs a constant amount of work regardless of the input size.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also \(O(1)\) because we only use a fixed number of variables for our calculations and do not require any additional data structures that scale with input size.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently determines the color of a chessboard square based on its coordinates using simple arithmetic and character manipulation. The method leverages the inherent properties of the chessboard's coloring pattern to produce a quick and effective result.

In summary, the `squareIsWhite` method provides a straightforward approach to solving the problem, utilizing basic operations to derive the answer. The compactness and efficiency of the solution make it an excellent example of how to handle coordinate-based problems in a chessboard-like scenario.

Overall, this implementation can be utilized in various applications where chessboard-like logic is required, and its simplicity ensures that it is easy to understand and maintain.
