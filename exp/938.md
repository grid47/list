### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and two integers `low` and `high`, the task is to return the sum of the values of all nodes with values in the inclusive range `[low, high]`.

### Approach
1. **Recursive Traversal**:
   - Use a recursive function to traverse the tree.
   - At each node, check:
     - If the node is null, return 0.
     - Recursively calculate the sum of values in the left subtree.
     - If the node's value is within the range `[low, high]`, add it to the sum.
     - Recursively calculate the sum of values in the right subtree.

2. **Summation**:
   - Combine the sums from the left and right subtrees with the current node's value (if it lies within the specified range) to get the total sum.

### Code Walk-through
- The main function `rangeSumBST` is called with the root of the BST and the `low` and `high` values.
- It employs a depth-first search (DFS) strategy to explore the tree and accumulate the relevant node values.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, all nodes are visited.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H) where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack. In the case of a balanced tree, this would be O(log N), and in the case of a skewed tree, it would be O(N).
