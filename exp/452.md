### Problem Statement
Given a collection of intervals representing the positions of balloons on a number line, determine the minimum number of arrows required to burst all the balloons. An arrow can be shot at any position along the number line, and if it hits a balloon, it bursts all balloons that overlap that position.

### Approach
1. **Sorting the Intervals**:
   - First, sort the intervals based on the end points. This allows us to efficiently determine how many arrows are needed by checking for overlaps.

2. **Counting Arrows**:
   - Initialize a counter (`cnt`) for the arrows and set the first arrow's position to the end of the first interval.
   - Iterate through the sorted list of intervals:
     - If the start of the current interval is less than or equal to the position of the last arrow (`arp`), it means the current balloon can be burst with the same arrow.
     - If not, increment the arrow count and update the arrow's position to the end of the current interval.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted based on their end points using a custom comparison function `cmp`.
   
2. **Iterating through the Sorted Intervals**:
   - Start with the first interval and set `arp` to its end point.
   - For each subsequent interval, check if it starts before or at `arp`:
     - If yes, continue to the next interval (no new arrow needed).
     - If no, increment the arrow count and update `arp` to the current interval's end.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of intervals. The dominant factor is the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of extra space, excluding the input.
