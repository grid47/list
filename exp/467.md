### Problem Statement
Given a string `p`, find the number of unique substrings of `p` that can be formed using a wraparound string formed by the lowercase English letters `a` to `z`. The wraparound string means that after `z`, it wraps around to `a`.

### Approach
1. **Understanding Wraparound Substrings**:
   - A substring can be formed if each character follows the next character in a circular manner from `a` to `z`. For example, `xyz`, `ab`, and `za` are valid wraparound substrings.

2. **Tracking Lengths**:
   - Use an array `len` of size 26 to store the maximum length of valid substrings ending with each character ('a' to 'z').
   - Iterate through the string `p`, counting the length of consecutive characters that follow the wraparound rule.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Initialize the first character in `len` to `1` as it can always form a substring by itself.
   - For each character in `p`, check if it continues the wraparound pattern from the previous character:
     - If yes, increment the current length `cur`.
     - If no, reset `cur` to `1`.
   - Update the `len` array for the current character with the maximum value between its current value and `cur`.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The result is the sum of all values in the `len` array, which represents the count of unique substrings.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - `vector<int> len(26, 0);` initializes the length array to zero.
   - `len[p[0] - 'a'] = 1;` sets the length for the first character.

2. **Loop Through String**:
   - For each character in `p` starting from the second character, check the wraparound condition:
     - `(p[i] + 26 - p[i - 1]) % 26 == 1` checks if `p[i]` follows `p[i - 1]` in a wraparound fashion.

3. **Update Lengths**:
   - `len[p[i] - 'a'] = max(len[p[i] - 'a'], cur);` updates the maximum length of substrings ending with `p[i]`.

4. **Final Count**:
   - `return accumulate(len.begin(), len.end(), 0);` returns the total count of unique substrings.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `p`, as we only traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the size of the `len` array is constant (26).
