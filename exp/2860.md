### Problem Statement

The problem involves counting the number of valid ways to select students from an array of `nums`, where each element in `nums` represents the number of students that are eligible for a certain role. The primary constraint for valid selection is that the number of selected students should be strictly greater than the value of the current student in the sorted array `nums`. Additionally, we need to ensure that there are no conflicts with the remaining students.

### Approach

The key insight to solve this problem lies in sorting the array `nums` and then systematically checking each student to see if they can be selected based on the constraint that the number of selected students must be strictly greater than the current student's value. By iterating over the array and counting selections, we can determine how many valid ways there are to make the selection.

The approach can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Sort the Input Array**: First, we sort the array `nums` in ascending order. Sorting helps to easily determine the threshold of eligible students as we iterate through the list.

2. **Initialization**: We initialize a counter for the number of valid selections and a counter for the number of selected students.

3. **Iterate Over the Array**: For each student in the sorted array, check if the number of selected students is strictly greater than the value of the current student in the array. If so, count this as a valid selection.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: Ensure that there are no conflicts between the selections. If the next student in the array has a value greater than the number of selected students, we increment the count. Similarly, we handle the last student by checking if they can be selected given the constraints.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the number of valid selections.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
```
- The array `nums` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting is crucial because it allows us to easily check if the number of selected students is strictly greater than the current value of each student in `nums`.

```cpp
int ans = 0, n = nums.size();
int selected = 0;
```
- `ans` is initialized to 0 and will store the total number of valid selections.
- `n` is the size of the `nums` array.
- `selected` is initialized to 0 and will count the number of students that have been selected.

```cpp
if (nums[0] != 0) ans = 1; // Not Selecting Anyone
```
- If the first element in the sorted `nums` array is not zero, this means that selecting no one is a valid way of selection. Thus, we set `ans` to 1 as we consider this case as one valid way.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    selected++;
```
- We iterate over the array `nums`. For each student (indexed by `i`), we increment the `selected` counter because we are considering this student for selection.

```cpp
if (selected > nums[i]) {  // No. of Selected Students is strictly greater than nums[i].
```
- If the number of selected students is greater than the value of the current student (`nums[i]`), we check whether this selection is valid and whether it will be possible to select further students.

```cpp
if (i + 1 < n && selected < nums[i + 1]) // Considering from (i+1) to n Students is not Selected.
    ans++;
```
- If we are not at the last student (`i + 1 < n`) and the number of selected students is strictly less than the next studentâ€™s value (`nums[i + 1]`), we count this as a valid selection and increment `ans`.

```cpp
else if (i + 1 == n) ans++;  // Last Student
```
- If we are at the last student (`i + 1 == n`), we can always select them, so we increment the answer as this is a valid selection.

```cpp
}
```
- The closing brace of the loop.

```cpp
return ans;
```
- Finally, return the result stored in `ans`, which represents the number of valid ways to select students.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- Sorting the array takes **O(n log n)** where `n` is the number of students.
- The for loop runs once for each student, so it takes **O(n)**.
Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is **O(n log n)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are only using a fixed amount of extra space for variables like `ans`, `selected`, and `n`.

### Conclusion

This solution provides an efficient way to count the number of valid selections of students from the array `nums`. By sorting the array and iterating through it while maintaining a count of selected students, the algorithm ensures that the conditions for valid selection are met. The time complexity of **O(n log n)** makes this approach efficient for large inputs. The solution handles edge cases like the first student not being eligible for selection or being able to select the last student without conflicts.
