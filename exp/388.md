### Problem Statement
Given a string representing a file system path where directories and files are separated by newline characters (`\n`) and directory levels are indicated by tab characters (`\t`), find the length of the longest path to a file. A path is considered to lead to a file if it contains a dot (`.`) in its name.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use a vector `levels` to keep track of the lengths of the current path at each directory level.
   - Variables for `level` (current directory level), `isFile` (flag to check if the current entry is a file), `ans` (maximum length of the file path), and `len` (length of the current file/directory name).

2. **Iterate Over Characters**:
   - Traverse through the string character by character.
   - Use a `switch` statement to handle different characters:
     - **Newline (`\n`)**: Reset `level`, `isFile`, and `len` to prepare for a new path entry.
     - **Tab (`\t`)**: Increment the `level` to indicate moving deeper into the directory structure.
     - **File Indicator (`.`)**: Set `isFile` to true if the current name contains a dot.
     - **Default**: Count the length of the current file/directory name and store it in `levels[level]`.

3. **Calculate Length**:
   - If the current entry is a file, calculate the total length of the path up to that file by summing the lengths from the `levels` vector, including the current level for file length.

4. **Return Maximum Length**:
   - The function returns the maximum length found for any file path.

### Code Walk-through
- The function processes the string in a single pass, making adjustments based on the character type.
- It uses a `switch` statement for clear handling of character types, making the code organized and easy to follow.
- At the end, the maximum path length is determined based on the accumulated lengths of directories leading to any file.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since we process each character once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(d), where d is the depth of the directory structure (up to 300 levels in this case).
