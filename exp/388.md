### üöÄ Problem Statement

The task is to find the **length of the longest absolute path to a file** in a file system, represented as a string. The string includes file and directory names, with each level of the file system being separated by a newline (`\n`). Directories are represented by names with possible tabs (`\t`) indicating their depth. A file is identified by the presence of a dot (`.`) in its name. 

We need to compute the longest path to any file, where the path is the sum of the lengths of directory and file names along the way from the root.

For example, given `s = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"`, the longest path is `"dir/subdir2/file.ext"`, which has a length of 18.

### üß† Approach

We can solve this problem by simulating a **file system traversal**. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Track Depth Levels**: 
   Every directory or file name is indented by tabs (`\t`). The number of tabs tells us the depth of the item in the file system hierarchy.
   
2. **Accumulate Path Lengths**: 
   As we process each line, we maintain the cumulative length of the path up to that level in the file system using an array called `levels`. This array keeps track of the path length at each depth level.

3. **Detect Files**: 
   Files are identified by the presence of a dot (`.`) in their name. Whenever we encounter a file, we compute the total path length by summing the path lengths of its parent directories and adding the length of the file name itself.

4. **Track Maximum Length**: 
   The key goal is to find the longest possible path. So, we continuously update the maximum path length as we encounter files.

### üî® Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Here‚Äôs the code that implements the above approach:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthLongestPath(string input) {
        vector<int> levels(300, 0);  // Array to store path lengths at each level
        int level = 0;  // Current depth level in the file system
        int ans = 0;  // Store the longest path length found
        int len = 0;  // Length of the current directory or file name
        bool isFile = false;  // Flag to check if the current item is a file

        // Iterate through each character of the input string
        for (char c : input) {
            switch (c) {
                case '\n':  // Newline indicates a new entry
                    level = 0, isFile = false, len = 0;  // Reset for new line
                    break;
                case '\t':  // Tab indicates a deeper level
                    level++;  // Increase the depth level
                    break;
                case '.':  // Dot indicates a file
                    isFile = true;  // Mark as a file
                    // No need for default case here
                default:
                    len++;  // Increment the length of the current name
                    levels[level] = len;  // Update the path length at this level
                    // If it's a file, calculate the total path length
                    if (isFile) {
                        ans = max(ans, accumulate(levels.begin(), levels.begin() + level + 1, 0) + level);
                    }
            }
        }
        return ans;  // Return the longest path length found
    }
};
```

### üìà Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string. 
  - We loop through each character in the input string once. 
  - The `accumulate` function is called only when a file is encountered, and since there are at most `O(n)` files, the total time complexity remains linear.

- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** (constant space).
  - The `levels` array is fixed in size (`300`), so its space usage does not depend on the input size.
  - The input string takes up `O(n)` space, but this space is provided by the problem and does not count toward the algorithm‚Äôs space complexity.

### üèÅ Conclusion

This solution efficiently finds the **longest absolute path to a file** in a file system represented as a string. The key idea is to simulate a file system traversal while maintaining cumulative path lengths for each directory level. By updating the longest path each time we encounter a file, we ensure that the solution remains efficient with a time complexity of **O(n)**.

### üéØ Key Takeaways:
- **Two main operations**: Track depth with tabs and accumulate path lengths dynamically.
- **File detection** is easy with the dot (`.`) character.
- **Optimal Time Complexity** of **O(n)** for large inputs.
- **Constant Space Complexity** of **O(1)** due to the fixed-size array used for path tracking.

With this approach, you‚Äôre ready to tackle any file system structure efficiently! üöÄ Happy coding! üíª
