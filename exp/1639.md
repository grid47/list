### Problem Statement

The problem at hand involves counting the number of ways to form a target string using characters from a list of words. Each word contributes its characters to the formation of the target string, and characters can only be used as many times as they appear in the respective word. This problem is essentially a combinatorial challenge, often framed in dynamic programming terms.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we utilize a dynamic programming approach that builds a solution based on previously computed subproblems. The essential steps of the approach include:

1. **Frequency Table Creation**: We create a frequency table that tracks how many times each character appears at each position across all given words.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We define a recursive function that computes the number of ways to form the target string by considering characters from the words one position at a time.

3. **Memoization**: To optimize performance and avoid recalculating results for the same states, we use memoization to store already computed results.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Letâ€™s walk through the provided code for better understanding.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string hit;
    int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
    vector<vector<int>> frq;
    int memo[1001][1001];
```
- Here, we define a class `Solution` which contains the necessary member variables:
  - `hit`: a string to store the target string.
  - `mod`: a constant for modulo operations to prevent overflow.
  - `frq`: a 2D vector to hold the frequency of each character at each index across the given words.
  - `memo`: a memoization array to store computed results for pairs of indices.

```cpp
    int dp(int fidx, int hidx) {
        if(hidx == hit.size()) return 1;
        if(fidx == frq.size()) return 0;
        
        if(memo[fidx][hidx] != -1) return memo[fidx][hidx];
```
- The `dp` function is the core of our dynamic programming solution. It takes two parameters:
  - `fidx`: the current index in the frequency table.
  - `hidx`: the current index in the target string.
  
- We have base cases:
  - If `hidx` equals the size of the target string, it means we've successfully formed the target string, so we return 1.
  - If `fidx` reaches the size of the frequency table, it means we've exhausted our words and cannot form the target, so we return 0.

- The memoization check ensures that we do not recompute results for the same state.

```cpp
        long ans = dp(fidx + 1, hidx);
```
- Here, we compute the number of ways to form the target without using the current frequency index `fidx`, which is a recursive call to the next frequency index while keeping the target index unchanged.

```cpp
        int ch = hit[hidx] - 'a';
        if(frq[fidx][ch] > 0) {
            ans = (ans + (long)(frq[fidx][ch] % mod) * (dp(fidx + 1, hidx + 1) % mod)) % mod;
        }
```
- Next, we check if the character from the target string at index `hidx` can be formed using the current frequency index `fidx`. If so, we update our answer `ans`:
  - We add the product of the frequency of that character (modulo `mod`) and the number of ways to form the remaining part of the target (by advancing both indices).

```cpp
        return memo[fidx][hidx] = ans % mod;
    }
```
- Finally, we store the computed result in the memoization array and return it.

#### Main Function to Count Ways

```cpp
    int numWays(vector<string>& words, string target) {
        hit = target;
        frq.resize(words[0].size(), vector<int>(26, 0));
        
        for(string s: words)
            for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
                frq[i][s[i] - 'a']++;
            }
```
- The `numWays` function initializes the `hit` variable and the frequency table `frq`. It iterates through each word and each character in the words to fill in the frequency table.

```cpp
        memset(memo, -1, sizeof(memo));
        return dp(0, 0);
    }
};
```
- We reset the memoization array to indicate that no states have been computed yet. Finally, we initiate the recursive dynamic programming function with starting indices of 0 for both the frequency and target strings.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity is \(O(n \cdot m)\), where \(n\) is the number of words and \(m\) is the maximum length of the words or the target. This accounts for filling the frequency table and the recursive computation in the `dp` function.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(m)\) for the memoization array and \(O(m \cdot 26)\) for the frequency table, where 26 is the number of lowercase English letters.

### Conclusion

The code efficiently counts the number of ways to form the target string using characters from a set of words by utilizing a dynamic programming approach. By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using memoization, the solution avoids unnecessary recomputation, making it both effective and efficient.

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **Dynamic Programming**: The use of dynamic programming allows us to solve combinatorial problems by breaking them into manageable subproblems.
2. **Memoization**: Storing results of subproblems is crucial in optimizing recursive solutions, reducing the time complexity significantly.
3. **Frequency Tables**: Constructing frequency tables is an effective way to track character availability across multiple sources (words, in this case).

This solution provides a comprehensive method to approach similar combinatorial string formation problems, showcasing the power of dynamic programming in solving complex challenges.
