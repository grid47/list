### Problem Statement
You are given an array `stones` where `stones[i]` represents the weight of the i-th stone. You can merge stones into piles according to the following rules:
1. A merge can only happen between two adjacent stones.
2. To merge stones, the number of stones must be equal to `k` after the merge, which creates one new pile.
3. The cost of merging stones is the total weight of the stones being merged.

The objective is to return the minimum cost to merge all the stones into one pile, or return `-1` if it is not possible.

### Approach
1. **Prefix Sum Array**:
   - Create a prefix sum array `prefix` to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray of stones.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a 3D memoization array `memo[i][j][m]` to store the minimum cost of merging the stones from index `i` to `j` with `m` piles.
   - The function `dp(i, j, m)` is defined to return the minimum cost to merge the stones between indices `i` and `j` into `m` piles.

3. **Base Cases**:
   - If the current segment size minus `m` is not divisible by `k - 1`, return `INT_MAX` (impossible state).
   - If only one stone remains (`i == j`):
     - If `m` is `1`, the cost is `0` since no merges are needed.
     - If `m` is greater than `1`, return `INT_MAX` (impossible to merge).

4. **Recursive Case**:
   - Iterate through possible merge points and calculate the minimum cost by splitting the range into two parts:
     - The first part is merged into one pile.
     - The second part can then be processed with `m - 1` piles.
   - Store the result in `memo`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - If the result of merging all stones into one pile is `>= INT_MAX`, return `-1`; otherwise, return the calculated minimum cost.

### Code Walk-through
- The function initializes the prefix sum array and the memoization array.
- The `dp` function is called with the entire range of stones and `1` pile.
- The final answer is derived from the memoization table.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2 * m), where `n` is the number of stones and `m` is the number of piles.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2 * m) for the memoization table and prefix sums.
