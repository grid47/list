### Problem Statement

The problem requires you to find the minimum cost to merge all the stones into one pile under certain conditions. Specifically, you are given a sequence of stones, and at each step, you can merge exactly **k** consecutive piles of stones into one pile. The cost of merging two piles is the total number of stones in those two piles. The goal is to determine the minimum cost to merge all the piles into one pile. If it's not possible to merge all the stones according to the rules, return `-1`.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can use **Dynamic Programming (DP)** with memoization. The problem can be broken down into subproblems where:
- We need to calculate the minimum cost to merge stones from position `i` to position `j` (inclusive) into exactly `m` piles, and
- We need to repeatedly merge subarrays of stones, making sure that at each step, exactly `k` stones are merged together.

### Key Insights:
1. **Prefix Sum Array**: To efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray of stones, we can maintain a prefix sum array. This allows us to quickly compute the sum of stones between any two indices `i` and `j` in constant time.

2. **Recursive Substructure**: To merge stones from index `i` to `j` into exactly `m` piles, we divide the problem into two subproblems:
   - First, merge stones from `i` to some index `p`.
   - Then, merge stones from `p + 1` to `j`.
   
   This division ensures that each subproblem considers merging `k` consecutive piles and accumulates the cost properly.

3. **Memoization**: To avoid recalculating overlapping subproblems, we use a 3D memoization table, where `memo[i][j][m]` stores the minimum cost to merge stones from `i` to `j` into exactly `m` piles.

4. **Recursive Decision Making**: The recursion works by calculating the minimum cost to merge a segment of stones and considering all valid ways to divide the segment into smaller segments that can be merged into the required number of piles.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> prefix;  // Stores the prefix sum of stones
    int k;               // The number of piles that must be merged at each step
    long memo[101][101][31];  // Memoization table to store the results of subproblems
```
- **Prefix Array**: This array stores the cumulative sum of the stones. `prefix[i]` stores the total number of stones from the beginning up to index `i-1`. It helps to calculate the sum of stones between any two indices efficiently.
- **Memoization Table**: The `memo` table is a 3D array where:
  - `memo[i][j][m]` stores the minimum cost to merge the stones from index `i` to index `j` into exactly `m` piles.
  
```cpp
    long dp(int i, int j, int m) {
        if((j - i + 1 - m) % (k - 1))  // If the difference between the subarray length and m is not divisible by k-1, return INT_MAX
            return INT_MAX;
        else if(i == j) {  // Base case: if we are looking at a single pile
            if(m == 1) {  // If we need to form exactly one pile, no cost is required
                return 0;
            } else {  // If we need to form more than one pile, it's impossible
                return INT_MAX;
            }
        }
```
- **Base Case**: If we are looking at a subarray from `i` to `j` with exactly `m` piles:
  - If `m == 1` and we only have one pile, no cost is incurred.
  - If `m > 1`, it's impossible to merge them into more than one pile without violating the `k`-pile merge rule, so we return `INT_MAX`.

```cpp
        if(memo[i][j][m] != -1) return memo[i][j][m];  // If the subproblem has been solved before, return the stored result
```
- **Memoization Check**: If the value for the current subproblem has been computed previously, we return the stored result.

```cpp
        if(m == 1)  // If we want exactly one pile, merge the entire subarray into one pile
            return dp(i, j, k) + prefix[j + 1] - prefix[i];
```
- **Merge into One Pile**: If we are tasked with merging the subarray `i` to `j` into exactly one pile:
  - We recursively merge the entire subarray into `k` piles (a larger number of piles) and add the cost of merging them.
  - The `prefix[j + 1] - prefix[i]` computes the cost (sum of stones in this range).

```cpp
        long ans = INT_MAX;
        for(int p = i; p < j; p += k - 1) {  // Try different positions to split the problem into smaller subproblems
            ans = min(ans, dp(i, p, 1) + dp(p + 1, j, m - 1));  // Merge subarrays and accumulate the cost
        }
        return memo[i][j][m] = ans;  // Store and return the result of the current subproblem
    }
```
- **Recursive Case**: The loop iterates over different possible split points `p` and recursively calculates the cost to merge the subarray into `m` piles. For each split point:
  - We recursively merge the left part into `1` pile.
  - We recursively merge the right part into `m-1` piles.
- The result is the minimum cost from all possible split points.

```cpp
    int mergeStones(vector<int>& stones, int k) {
        this->k = k;
        int n = stones.size();
        prefix.resize(n + 1, 0);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + stones[i];  // Calculate the prefix sum of the stones
        
        memset(memo, -1, sizeof(memo));  // Initialize memoization table with -1
        int ans = dp(0, n - 1, 1);  // Call the dp function to get the minimum cost to merge all stones into one pile
        
        return ans >= INT_MAX ? -1 : ans;  // If no valid solution, return -1
    }
};
```

- **Main Function**:
  - Initializes the `k` value and calculates the prefix sum array.
  - Initializes the memoization table to `-1` to signify that no subproblem has been solved initially.
  - Calls the `dp` function to find the minimum cost to merge all stones into one pile.
  - If the result is `INT_MAX`, it means it's impossible to merge the stones into one pile, and `-1` is returned.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n^3)**, where `n` is the number of stones. This is because:
  - We have a 3D DP table with dimensions `n x n x k`.
  - For each subproblem, we check all possible ways to divide the range into smaller subarrays, which takes `O(k)` time.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(n^2 * k)** due to the storage needed for the DP memoization table, where `n` is the number of stones and `k` is the maximum number of piles.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the problem using dynamic programming and memoization. By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and leveraging the prefix sum array for efficient range sum calculations, the solution finds the minimum cost of merging stones. The time complexity of **O(n^3)** and space complexity of **O(n^2 * k)** make this solution feasible for moderately large inputs, handling the complexity of merging stones under the given constraints.
