### Problem Statement
Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers, where the digits are stored in reverse order, add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

### Approach
Iterate through both linked lists, summing the corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous step. Create new nodes to represent each digit of the sum, which is also stored in reverse order.

### Code Walk-through
1. Initialize a dummy head node `head` and a pointer `tail` to build the result linked list. Also, initialize a variable `rm` to keep track of the carry.
2. Use a while loop to continue until both lists are fully traversed and there is no remaining carry:
   - Extract the values from `l1` and `l2` (defaulting to 0 if a list is exhausted).
   - Compute the total `sum` of these values and the carry.
   - Determine the digit to store in the new node using `digit = sum % 10`, and update the carry using `rm = sum / 10`.
   - Create a new node for the calculated digit and attach it to the result list.
   - Move to the next nodes in `l1` and `l2`.
3. After the loop, the result linked list starts from `head->next`. Clean up by deleting the dummy head and return the result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) - where \(n\) is the maximum length of the two linked lists.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) - additional space is used for the resulting linked list.
