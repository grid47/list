### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, you need to determine if there exists a loop in the array such that:
- The loop is formed by following the indices according to the values in the array (e.g., if `nums[i]` is 2, move to index `i + 2`).
- The loop must consist of the same sign (all positive or all negative).
- The loop must have a length of at least two (i.e., you cannot loop back to the same index immediately).

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Get the size of the array `n`.
   - Return `false` if the array has only one element.

2. **Iterate through the Array**:
   - Loop through each element in `nums`.
   - Skip elements that have already been marked as `0` (indicating they are part of a processed loop).

3. **Finding Loops**:
   - Use two pointers, `j` and `k`, to find a loop:
     - `j` starts at the current index.
     - `k` is initialized to the index pointed to by the first step.
   - Move `j` one step at a time and `k` two steps at a time (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm).
   - If `j` and `k` meet, check if they point to different indices (ensuring the loop length is at least 2).

4. **Mark Processed Elements**:
   - If a valid loop is found, mark the entire loop by setting the values to `0` to avoid reprocessing.
   - Use the value of the starting element to determine the direction and sign of the loop.

5. **Return Result**:
   - If no loop is found after processing all elements, return `false`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Get Next Index**:
   - The `getIdx` function calculates the next index based on the current index and the value at that index while handling wrap-around for negative values.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop iterates through the elements, applying the above logic to find and mark loops.

3. **End Condition**:
   - If a loop is detected, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false` after checking all elements.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array since each element is processed at most twice (once for finding a loop and once for marking).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since no additional data structures are used apart from variables for pointers and indices.
