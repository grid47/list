### Problem Statement
The task requires checking if the binary representations of all integers from 1 to \( n \) are present as substrings within a given binary string \( s \). For example, if \( s \) is "0110" and \( n \) is 3, the binary representations of 1 ("1") and 2 ("10") are found in \( s \), but we must also check for 3 ("11"), which is also present. Therefore, the output for this case would be `true`.

The challenge is to efficiently determine if every integer from 1 to \( n \) has its binary form included in \( s \).

### Approach
To solve this problem, we can utilize the properties of binary representation and substring searching:
1. **Iterate Over Numbers**: We will iterate from \( n \) down to \( n/2 \) because any number greater than \( n/2 \) will have its binary representation containing more leading zeros.
2. **Binary Conversion**: For each number, convert it to its binary representation.
3. **Substring Check**: Use the `find` method to check if the binary representation exists as a substring within \( s \). 
4. **Return Result**: If all binary representations from \( n \) down to \( n/2 \) are found, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Function Declaration**:
   - The function `queryString` is defined as a public member of the `Solution` class, taking a string \( s \) and an integer \( n \) as input parameters.

2. **Iterating Through Numbers**:
   - A `for` loop is initiated, iterating \( i \) from \( n \) down to \( n/2 \). This range is chosen because the binary representations of numbers larger than \( n/2 \) can be determined without leading zeros.

3. **Binary Conversion**:
   - Within the loop, the current number \( i \) is converted to a binary string using `bitset<32>(i).to_string()`. This constructs a 32-bit binary representation of \( i \).

4. **Extracting Relevant Substring**:
   - The line `b.substr(b.find('1'))` extracts the relevant substring of the binary string \( b \) that starts from the first occurrence of '1'. This is done to eliminate any leading zeros which would not affect substring matching in \( s \).

5. **Substring Check**:
   - The `find` method is then used to determine if the extracted substring exists within the string \( s \). If the substring is not found (i.e., `string::npos`), it means that the binary representation for \( i \) is missing from \( s \), and the function returns `false`.

6. **Returning True**:
   - If the loop completes without returning `false`, the function returns `true`, indicating that all required binary representations have been found in \( s \).

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this function is \( O(n \cdot k) \), where \( k \) is the average length of the binary representations of the integers being checked (approximately \( \log_2 n \)). The outer loop runs \( n/2 \) times, and each binary conversion and substring check can take \( O(k) \).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \( O(1) \) if we disregard the input storage since we are using only a fixed number of additional variables for computation, regardless of the input size.

### Conclusion
The `queryString` function efficiently checks whether all binary representations of numbers from 1 to \( n \) are present as substrings within the given binary string \( s \). By iterating only through relevant numbers and utilizing binary conversion combined with substring searching, the solution achieves a balance between clarity and performance.

This implementation highlights the practical application of binary representation and substring searching techniques in algorithm design. Understanding such techniques can significantly enhance problem-solving capabilities, particularly in competitive programming and coding interviews.

Furthermore, the approach can be adapted to similar problems involving substring checks or binary manipulations, reinforcing the versatility and utility of this solution. The function exemplifies a straightforward yet effective method for solving a common class of problems related to binary strings and numeric representations.

In summary, the `queryString` function showcases an intelligent application of number theory and string manipulation, making it a valuable addition to any programmerâ€™s toolkit. The function's efficiency, combined with its clear logic, makes it a strong candidate for use in a variety of scenarios where substring presence is a critical factor in determining the validity of numeric properties.
