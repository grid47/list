### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, you need to find the maximum value of the rotation function `F(k)`, which is defined as:

\[ F(k) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (nums[i] \times i) \]

where \( i \) is the index of the element after rotating the array `k` times.

### Approach
1. **Initial Calculation**:
   - Compute the initial value of `F(0)` (which is \( F(0) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (nums[i] \times i) \)).
   - Also, compute the total sum of elements in the array, which will be used for subsequent calculations.

2. **Iterative Update**:
   - For each possible rotation \( k \) (from 1 to \( n-1 \)):
     - Update the function value using the formula:
     \[
     F(k) = F(k-1) + \text{sum} - n \times \text{nums}[n-k]
     \]
     - This formula accounts for the change in the contribution of the elements as the array is rotated.

3. **Maximization**:
   - Keep track of the maximum value encountered during the iterations.

### Code Walk-through
- The `maxRotateFunction` function initializes variables to store the total sum and the initial function value.
- It then iteratively calculates the new function value for each rotation and compares it to the maximum found so far.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), as it requires a single pass to calculate the initial values and another pass to compute the maximum value through the iterations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional data structures are used that scale with input size.
