### Problem Statement

The problem asks to calculate the maximum possible value of a rotated function `F(k)` for a given array of integers `nums`. Specifically, the function `F(k)` is defined as:

\[
F(k) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (nums[i] \times (i + k) \mod n)
\]

Where `n` is the length of the array, and `k` is the number of rotations. The task is to find the maximum value of `F(k)` across all possible values of `k`.

For example:
- Given the array `[4, 3, 2, 6]`, the function `F(k)` calculates the sum of products of elements and their indices after rotating the array `k` times. The goal is to find the maximum value of `F(k)` over all rotations.

### Approach

The approach revolves around the concept of rotating the function `F(k)` and finding a pattern that helps optimize the computation rather than recalculating `F(k)` from scratch for each rotation. We can utilize a mathematical approach to derive the next value of `F(k)` from the previous value to avoid redundant computations.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let’s break down the code and its logic:

#### Step 1: Initialize `sum` and `fn`
```cpp
long sum = 0, fn = 0;
int n = nums.size();
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum += nums[i];
    fn += i * nums[i];
}
```
- The first step is to compute two key values:
  - `sum` is the sum of all elements in the `nums` array. This value will be used later to adjust `F(k)` as we perform rotations.
  - `fn` is the initial value of the function `F(0)` which represents the value of the function when no rotations have occurred. This value is calculated as:
    \[
    F(0) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i \times nums[i])
    \]
    This is simply the sum of each element in the array multiplied by its index.

#### Step 2: Set up variables for rotation
```cpp
long l = 1, r;
long newfn = fn;
```
- `l` represents the current rotation index (starting from 1 for the first rotation).
- `r` will represent the last index in the rotated array (calculated dynamically as we go through the rotations).
- `newfn` is a variable used to store the current function value as we progress through the rotations.

#### Step 3: Perform rotations and update `F(k)`
```cpp
while(l < n) {
    r = l + n - 1;
    long removed = (l - 1) * nums[l - 1];
    long added = r * nums[r % n];

    newfn = newfn - removed + added - sum;

    fn = max(fn, newfn);
    l++;
}
```
- The `while` loop iterates through each rotation `k` starting from 1 to `n-1` (since `F(0)` is already computed).
- For each rotation, we perform the following steps:
  1. **Calculate `r`**: `r` represents the last index of the array after `l` rotations, which is `l + n - 1` (adjusted with the modulo `n`).
  2. **Calculate `removed`**: This is the term to remove from the current function value `newfn`. When we rotate the array, the element at index `l-1` is moved out of the calculation, so we need to subtract its contribution: `(l - 1) * nums[l - 1]`.
  3. **Calculate `added`**: This is the term to add to the current function value `newfn`. The element at index `r` will be rotated into the calculation, so we add its contribution: `r * nums[r % n]`.
  4. **Update `newfn`**: We adjust the value of `newfn` by subtracting `removed` and adding `added`, then subtracting the `sum` (since `sum` remains constant across all rotations).
  5. **Update the maximum `fn`**: The value of `fn` is updated to be the maximum between the current `fn` and the new `newfn` computed for the current rotation.
  6. **Increment the rotation index `l`**: Move on to the next rotation.

#### Step 4: Return the result
```cpp
return fn;
```
- After all rotations are processed, the function returns `fn`, which holds the maximum value of `F(k)` for any `k` from `0` to `n-1`.

### Example Walkthrough

Let’s walk through an example to understand the behavior of the algorithm:

**Example 1:**
```cpp
maxRotateFunction([4, 3, 2, 6]);
```
1. Initial values:
   - `sum = 4 + 3 + 2 + 6 = 15`
   - `fn = 0 * 4 + 1 * 3 + 2 * 2 + 3 * 6 = 0 + 3 + 4 + 18 = 25`
   
2. First rotation (`k=1`):
   - `l = 1, r = 4 (index out of bounds, adjusted by mod)`
   - `removed = 0 * 4 = 0`
   - `added = 4 * 6 = 24`
   - `newfn = 25 - 0 + 24 - 15 = 34`
   - `fn = max(25, 34) = 34`

3. Second rotation (`k=2`):
   - `l = 2, r = 5 (again adjusted by mod)`
   - `removed = 1 * 3 = 3`
   - `added = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `newfn = 34 - 3 + 20 - 15 = 36`
   - `fn = max(34, 36) = 36`

4. Third rotation (`k=3`):
   - `l = 3, r = 6 (adjusted by mod)`
   - `removed = 2 * 2 = 4`
   - `added = 6 * 3 = 18`
   - `newfn = 36 - 4 + 18 - 15 = 35`
   - `fn = max(36, 35) = 36`

- The final result is `36`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array. The solution iterates through the array only once to compute the sum and the initial function value `fn`. Then, it performs a single pass to compute the value of `F(k)` for each rotation and updates the maximum result. Since there are `n` rotations, the time complexity is linear.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`. The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, i.e., no additional data structures that grow with input size are used. The space used is constant, regardless of the input size.

### Conclusion

This approach efficiently computes the maximum possible value of the function `F(k)` by exploiting the relationship between consecutive rotations. Instead of recalculating the entire function from scratch for each rotation, the solution incrementally adjusts the value of `F(k)` based on the previous value, removing and adding the necessary contributions. With a linear time complexity of `O(n)` and constant space complexity of `O(1)`, this algorithm is well-suited for large inputs, making it both time and space efficient.
