### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, the goal is to partition the array into `k` contiguous subarrays such that the sum of their averages is maximized. 

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
   - Use a 2D memoization table (`memo`) where `memo[i][j]` represents the maximum sum of averages that can be obtained by partitioning the first `i` elements into `j` parts.

2. **Base Case Initialization**:
   - Pre-compute the average of the first `i` elements and store it in `memo[i][1]` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, where `n` is the length of the array. This is done using a cumulative sum `cur`.

3. **Recursive Search**:
   - Implement a recursive function `search(n, k, nums)` that:
     - Checks if the result for `memo[n][k]` has already been computed.
     - Iterates through the array to find possible partitions by considering the last segment from index `i` to `n`, updating the maximum sum of averages using previously computed values.
     - For each index `i`, calculate the average of the segment and add it to the result of recursively calling the function for the previous segment with `k-1` partitions.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Call `search(n, k, nums)` to get the final result for the entire array and the specified number of partitions.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains methods to calculate the largest sum of averages.
    - `double largestSumOfAverages(vector<int>& nums, int k)`: Main function to initialize variables and start the search.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `nums`: A vector of integers representing the array.
        - `k`: An integer representing the number of partitions.
      - **Returns**: The maximum sum of averages after partitioning.

- **Recursive Function**:
  - `double search(int n, int k, vector<int> &nums)`: Helper function to perform the recursive DP search.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `n`: The current length of the segment being considered.
      - `k`: The remaining number of partitions to create.
      - **Returns**: The maximum sum of averages for the current segment and partitions.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2 * k), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums` and `k` is the number of partitions since we compute the result for each combination of `n` and `k`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * k) for the memoization table.
