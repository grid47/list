### Problem Statement
You are given a 2D grid representing stones, where each stone's position is represented by a pair of coordinates (x, y). You can remove a stone if it's in the same row or column as another stone. The goal is to find the maximum number of stones that can be removed.

### Approach
1. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - Implement a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to efficiently group stones based on their connections (i.e., same row or column).

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize the Union-Find structure with each stone as its own parent, and count the total number of stones.

3. **Union Operations**:
   - Use two maps to track the last stone in each row (`x`) and column (`y`).
   - For each stone, if a stone exists in the same row or column, perform a union operation to connect them.

4. **Count Components**:
   - After processing all stones, the number of distinct components (connected groups of stones) will determine how many stones can be removed.
   - The maximum number of stones that can be removed is equal to the total number of stones minus the number of distinct components.

### Code Walk-through
- The function initializes the Union-Find structure, iterates through the list of stones, and connects them based on their row and column affiliations. Finally, it calculates the maximum removable stones by subtracting the count of connected components from the total number of stones.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of stones, as each stone is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the Union-Find data structure and the maps used to track the last stones in each row and column.
