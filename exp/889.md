### Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays `preorder` and `postorder` representing the preorder and postorder traversal of a binary tree, construct the binary tree.

### Approach
The tree can be reconstructed using the properties of preorder and postorder traversals:
1. **Preorder Traversal**: The first element is the root of the tree.
2. **Postorder Traversal**: The last element is the root of the subtree, and the left and right subtrees can be determined recursively.

### Steps
1. **Initialization**:
   - Maintain two indices: `preIdx` to track the current position in the preorder array and `postIdx` to track the current position in the postorder array.
   
2. **Recursive Construction**:
   - Create a new `TreeNode` using the current value from the `preorder` array.
   - Increment `preIdx` after creating a node.
   - Check if the current node's value matches the current `postorder[postIdx]`.
     - If they don't match, recursively construct the left subtree.
     - After constructing the left subtree, check again and construct the right subtree if needed.
   - Finally, increment `postIdx` after the left and right children are processed.
   
3. **Base Case**:
   - The recursion will implicitly terminate when the entire tree has been constructed.

### Code Walk-through
- The constructor uses recursion to build the tree based on the given preorder and postorder arrays.
- Each call to the function will create a node and potentially build its left and right subtrees until the complete tree is reconstructed.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes, as we process each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack.
