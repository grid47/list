### Problem Statement
Given a list of strings `source`, representing the lines of a C++ program, your task is to remove all comments from the source code. The comments can be of two types:
- Single-line comments that start with `//` and continue until the end of the line.
- Multi-line comments that start with `/*` and end with `*/`.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Create a vector `ans` to store the resulting lines after comments are removed.
   - Use a boolean `is_mul` to track whether you are currently inside a multi-line comment.
   - Initialize a string `res` to accumulate the current line's valid characters.

2. **Iterate Through Each Line**:
   - For each line in the source:
     - Reset `res` to an empty string if not in a multi-line comment.
     - Iterate through each character in the line:
       - If not in a multi-line comment:
         - Check for the start of a single-line comment (`//`). If found, break out of the loop.
         - Check for the start of a multi-line comment (`/*`). If found, set `is_mul` to true and skip the next character.
         - Otherwise, add the character to `res`.
       - If in a multi-line comment:
         - Check for the end of the multi-line comment (`*/`). If found, set `is_mul` to false and skip the next character.

3. **Store Non-empty Results**:
   - After processing each line, if `res` is not empty and you are not in a multi-line comment, add `res` to the `ans` vector.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function**:
  - `removeComments(vector<string>& source)`: Removes comments from the source code and returns the cleaned lines as a vector of strings.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the total number of characters across all lines in `source`, as each character is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(K), where K is the number of lines in the output, as we store only the lines that contain valid code without comments.
