### Problem Statement
The task is to multiply two non-negative integers represented as strings and return the product also as a string.

### Approach
1. **Edge Case**:
   - If either of the input strings is "0", return "0" immediately.

2. **Result Storage**:
   - Use a vector `res` to store the results of the multiplication, with a size equal to the sum of the lengths of the two input strings.

3. **Multiplication Logic**:
   - Iterate over each digit of `num1` and `num2` in reverse order.
   - For each digit pair, multiply the digits and store the result in the appropriate position in `res`, while handling carries:
     - Update the current position and the carry for the next position.

4. **Building the Result String**:
   - Skip any leading zeros in the `res` vector.
   - Convert the remaining digits into a string.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Start by checking for the "0" condition.
   - Create a result vector `res` to hold the intermediate multiplication results.

2. **Nested Loops**:
   - The outer loop iterates through `num1` and the inner loop through `num2`, performing the multiplication and updating the result vector.

3. **Handling Carry**:
   - Update the current index in the result vector with any overflow from the previous multiplication.

4. **Result Construction**:
   - Initialize an index to skip leading zeros and build the final string from the non-zero elements.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are the lengths of `num1` and `num2`, respectively, due to the nested iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m + n)\) for the result storage, as we store the intermediate results in the vector.
