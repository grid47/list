### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, partition it into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

### Approach
1. **Last Occurrence Mapping**:
   - Create a map to store the last occurrence index of each character in the string.

2. **Iterate and Partition**:
   - Initialize variables to track the previous partition's end and the maximum index of the current partition.
   - Iterate through the string:
     - Update the maximum index based on the last occurrences.
     - When the current index matches the maximum index, a partition can be finalized.
     - Store the size of the partition and update the previous partition's end.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method for partitioning.

- **Method**:
  - `vector<int> partitionLabels(string s)`: This method implements the logic to partition the string and return the sizes of the partitions.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, due to the single pass required to determine partitions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the space used for the last occurrence mapping is bounded by the constant number of characters (at most 26 for lowercase letters).
