### Problem Statement
Implement a function to search for a target value in a sorted array of integers. If the target exists, return its index; otherwise, return -1.

### Approach
1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `nums`: A vector of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `target`: The integer value to search for in the array.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `l` (left) at the start of the array and `r` (right) at the end.
   - While the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer:
     - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
     - If the value at `mid` equals the target, return `mid`.
     - If the value at `mid` is less than the target, move the left pointer to `mid + 1`.
     - If the value at `mid` is greater than the target, move the right pointer to `mid - 1`.
   - If the target is not found, return -1.

### Code Walk-through
- The function iteratively narrows down the search range by adjusting the left and right pointers based on the comparison between `nums[mid]` and `target`.
- The loop continues until the target is found or the search space is exhausted.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log N), where N is the number of elements in the array, due to halving the search space with each iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space is used that scales with the input size.
