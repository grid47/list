### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, generate all structurally unique binary search trees (BSTs) that store values from `1` to `n`. Each unique BST should maintain the BST property where nodes to the left are smaller and nodes to the right are larger than the root.

### Approach
This solution employs recursion with dynamic generation of subtrees:
1. **Recursive Helper Function** `run(l, r)`: 
   - Given a range `[l, r]`, this function returns all unique BSTs possible with node values in that range.
   - **Base Case**: If `l > r`, return a vector containing `NULL`, representing an empty subtree.
   - **Single Node Tree**: If `l == r`, create a single-node tree and return it.
   - **Recursive Construction**:
     - For each `i` in `[l, r]`, consider `i` as the root:
       - Recursively generate all possible left subtrees with nodes in `[l, i - 1]`.
       - Recursively generate all possible right subtrees with nodes in `[i + 1, r]`.
       - Combine each left subtree with each right subtree by setting `i` as the root.
2. **Main Function** `generateTrees(n)`:
   - Loop through each value in `[1, n]` as a potential root.
   - For each root `i`, generate possible left and right subtrees and connect them to form all unique BSTs.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Base Cases in `run(l, r)`**:
   - If the range is empty, return `NULL`.
   - If the range has a single node, return a tree with that single node.
2. **Loop Over Each Root**:
   - For each potential root, recursively build left and right subtrees.
   - Combine each left and right subtree with the root to form a BST.
3. **Result**: The `generateTrees(n)` function returns a vector of all unique BSTs for values from `1` to `n`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(4^n / \sqrt{n})\) due to the recursive generation of Catalan numbers, as each unique BST corresponds to a unique structure.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(4^n / \sqrt{n})\), considering storage of each unique BST structure.
