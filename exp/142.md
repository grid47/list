### Problem Statement
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `NULL`.

### Approach
1. **Two Pointers**:
   - Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to detect a cycle in the linked list.
   - If a cycle is detected, find the entry point of the cycle.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1-5**: Define the `ListNode` structure for the linked list.
- **Line 6**: Define the `detectCycle` function:
  - **Line 7**: Check if the head is `NULL`. If so, return `NULL`.
  - **Line 8**: Initialize `fast` and `slow` pointers to the head of the list.
  - **Line 9-14**: Use a while loop to move the `slow` pointer one step and the `fast` pointer two steps:
    - If `fast` meets `slow`, break out of the loop.
  - **Line 15**: Check if no cycle was found (i.e., if `fast` or `fast->next` is `NULL`). If so, return `NULL`.
  - **Line 17-21**: Use another while loop to find the entry point of the cycle:
    - Move both `head` and `slow` pointers one step at a time until they meet. The meeting point is the start of the cycle.
  
### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the linked list, since each node is visited at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as no additional space is used (only two pointers are maintained).
