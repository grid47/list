### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, find all unique quadruplets \((a, b, c, d)\) such that \(a + b + c + d = \text{target}\).

### Approach
1. **Sorting**: Start by sorting the input array to facilitate the two-pointer technique and to avoid duplicates.
2. **Using Sets for Uniqueness**: Utilize a set to store unique quadruplets, as it automatically handles duplicates.
3. **Nested Loops**:
   - Use two nested loops to fix the first two numbers of the quadruplet.
   - For the remaining two numbers, use a two-pointer approach.
4. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Set the pointers: one starting just after the second fixed number and the other at the end of the array.
   - Adjust the pointers based on the sum of the two pointers compared to the new target (adjusted for the fixed numbers).
5. **Collect Results**: Once a valid quadruplet is found, insert it into the set to ensure uniqueness.
6. **Output**: Convert the set to a vector for the final result.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Sort the array and initialize a set to store unique quadruplets and a vector for the output.
   
2. **Outer Loops**:
   - Iterate over the first two indices \(i\) and \(j\) in the sorted array.

3. **Adjust Target**:
   - Calculate the new target for the remaining two numbers by subtracting the values at the fixed indices from the original target.

4. **Inner Loop with Two Pointers**:
   - Use two pointers `low` and `high` to find the remaining two numbers.
   - If the sum of the two pointed values is less than the new target, increment `low`.
   - If it's greater, decrement `high`.
   - If equal, store the quadruplet in the set and move both pointers.

5. **Final Output**:
   - Transfer all unique quadruplets from the set to the output vector.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^3)\), where \(n\) is the size of the input array, as we have nested loops for the first two indices and the two-pointer technique for the last two indices.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) for the space used by pointers and fixed variables, but the space used for the set depends on the number of unique quadruplets found.
