### Problem Statement

The task is to identify names of individuals who are "alerted" based on their recorded login times. An individual is considered alerted if they have logged in at least three times within a one-hour period. The function should take two lists as input: one containing names of individuals and another containing corresponding times of their logins. The output should be a sorted list of names who meet the alert criteria.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to store each individual's login times, convert these times into a single unit (minutes), and then check for consecutive logins within an hour. The following steps outline the approach:

1. **Data Structure**: Use an unordered map where the key is the individual's name and the value is a vector of integers representing login times in minutes.

2. **Time Conversion**: For each login time, convert the string format (HH:MM) into total minutes since the start of the day (e.g., 01:30 becomes 90).

3. **Sorting Login Times**: After storing the times for each name, sort the vector of times for easy comparison.

4. **Alert Condition**: For each individual's sorted login times, check for sequences where three or more logins occur within any one-hour window.

5. **Result Compilation**: Collect the names that meet the alert criteria and return them in sorted order.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the provided code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> alertNames(vector<string>& name, vector<string>& time) {
```
- The class `Solution` contains a public method `alertNames`, which accepts two vectors: `name` (individual names) and `time` (corresponding login times).

```cpp
        unordered_map<string, vector<int>> mp;
        
        int n = name.size();
```
- We declare an unordered map `mp` to associate names with their login times. The variable `n` stores the number of entries.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            mp[name[i]].push_back(stoi(time[i].substr(0, 2)) * 60 + stoi(time[i].substr(3)));
```
- We iterate through the names and times. For each name, we convert the login time from the string format (HH:MM) to minutes:
  - `stoi(time[i].substr(0, 2))` gets the hour part.
  - `stoi(time[i].substr(3))` gets the minute part.
  - The total minutes for each time is calculated and pushed into the vector corresponding to that name in the map.

```cpp
        vector<string> ans;
        for(auto &it: mp) {
            sort(it.second.begin(), it.second.end());
```
- We declare a vector `ans` to store the names of individuals who are alerted. We then iterate over each entry in the map and sort the login times for each name.

```cpp
            for(int i = 0, j = 0; i < it.second.size(); i++) {
                while(it.second[i] - it.second[j] > 60)
                    j++;
```
- For each sorted list of times, we use two pointers (`i` and `j`) to check if there are three or more logins within a 60-minute window:
  - `i` is the current time being considered.
  - `j` is adjusted forward to find the start of the one-hour window.

```cpp
                if(i - j >= 2) {
                    ans.push_back(it.first);
                    break;
                }
            }
```
- If the difference between `i` and `j` indicates at least three logins in the last hour (i.e., `i - j >= 2`), the name associated with this list is added to `ans`.

```cpp
        sort(ans.begin(), ans.end());
        return ans;
    }
};
```
- After checking all individuals, we sort the `ans` vector to ensure the names are returned in alphabetical order before returning it.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n + m \cdot k)\), where:
    - \(n\) is the number of names (or login times).
    - \(m\) is the number of unique names.
    - \(k\) is the average number of login times per name. Sorting the times contributes to the \(O(k \log k)\) complexity for each unique name.

- **Space Complexity**: 
  - The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the storage of login times in the map.

### Conclusion

The provided implementation of the `alertNames` function efficiently identifies individuals who have logged in three or more times within any one-hour period. This is achieved through the use of a hashmap to organize login times, sorting those times for each individual, and then applying a two-pointer technique to detect the alert condition.

Key aspects of this solution include:

1. **Scalability**: The use of efficient data structures allows the algorithm to handle larger datasets effectively.

2. **Clarity**: The code structure clearly separates concerns, making it easier to read and maintain.

3. **Performance**: By limiting the number of comparisons through sorted times and using a two-pointer approach, the solution optimizes the checks required for the alert condition.

In summary, this implementation is a solid example of leveraging data structures and algorithms to solve a problem with clear and efficient code.
