### Problem Statement
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day. You want to maximize your profit by performing at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock) while paying a transaction fee `fee` for each buy transaction. Return the maximum profit you can achieve.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use two arrays, `buy` and `sell`, to keep track of the maximum profit on each day when holding a stock (`buy[i]`) and when not holding a stock (`sell[i]`).

2. **State Initialization**:
   - Set `buy[0]` to `-prices[0] - fee`, indicating the initial state of buying on the first day (including the transaction fee).

3. **State Transition**:
   - For each day `i` from 1 to `days - 1`:
     - `buy[i]`: Maximum profit of holding stock after day `i`, which can come from:
       - Not buying any stock (i.e., staying in the previous state `buy[i - 1]`).
       - Selling stock on day `i - 1` and buying stock on day `i` (accounting for the fee).
     - `sell[i]`: Maximum profit of not holding stock after day `i`, which can come from:
       - Not selling any stock (i.e., staying in the previous state `sell[i - 1]`).
       - Buying stock on day `i - 1` and selling it on day `i`.

4. **Result**:
   - The maximum profit at the end of the last day is stored in `sell[days - 1]`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function**:
  - `maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee)`: Calculates the maximum profit achievable with the given prices and transaction fee.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `prices` array, since we iterate through the prices once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the `buy` and `sell` arrays to store profits for each day.
