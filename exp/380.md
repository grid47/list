### üöÄ Problem Statement

In this challenge, we need to implement a data structure called `RandomizedSet` that supports the following operations:

1. **Insert**: Insert a value into the set if it's not already present.
2. **Remove**: Remove a value from the set if it exists.
3. **Get Random**: Retrieve a random element from the set.

The real trick here is that we need to make the **Insert** and **Remove** operations **efficient** (constant time), while still being able to randomly pick an element with **O(1)** time complexity.

### üß† Approach

To build a `RandomizedSet` that efficiently supports all three operations, we'll use a **combination of a vector** and an **unordered map**:

1. **Vector (`a`)**:
   - The vector holds the elements of the set. Since we need **random access** to any element, the vector provides **O(1)** time complexity for accessing an element by its index.
   - We will use the **last element** of the vector to replace any removed element. This ensures the **O(1)** complexity for the `Remove` operation.

2. **Unordered Map (`m`)**:
   - The map stores the value as the **key** and its corresponding index in the vector as the **value**.
   - This allows us to check if an element is present in the set in **O(1)** time and to find its index quickly, which is crucial for efficient removal.

### üî® Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Let's walk through the implementation!

#### Step 1: Define the `RandomizedSet` Class
```cpp
class RandomizedSet {
private:
    vector<int> a;
    unordered_map<int, int> m;
public:
    RandomizedSet() {
    }
```
- We start by defining our class `RandomizedSet` with two private members:
  - `a`: The vector storing elements.
  - `m`: The unordered map that maps each element to its index in the vector.

---

#### Step 2: Insert Method
```cpp
    bool insert(int val) {
        if(m.find(val) != m.end())
            return false;
        else{
            a.push_back(val);
            m[val] = a.size() - 1;
            return true;
        }
    }
```
- The `insert` method checks if the value is already in the map (`m.find(val)`). If it's not found, the value is:
  - Added to the vector `a`.
  - Its index in `a` is stored in the map `m`.
- If the insertion is successful, the method returns **true**. If the element is already in the set, it returns **false**.

---

#### Step 3: Remove Method
```cpp
    bool remove(int val) {
        if(m.find(val) == m.end())
            return false;
        else{
            int last = a.back();
            a[m[val]] = a.back();
            a.pop_back();
            m[last] = m[val];
            m.erase(val);
            return true;
        }
    }
```
- The `remove` method first checks if the element exists in the set using `m.find(val)`. If it's not in the set, it returns **false**.
- If the element exists:
  - The last element in the vector is swapped with the element to be removed.
  - The last element is removed, and the map is updated with the new index of the swapped element.
- This ensures that the removal is done efficiently in **O(1)** time.

---

#### Step 4: Get Random Method
```cpp
    int getRandom() {
        return a[rand() % a.size()];
    }
```
- The `getRandom` method generates a random index using `rand() % a.size()`. Since the vector allows constant time access to any element, this operation is **O(1)**.

---

### üìà Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **Insert Operation**: **O(1)**. Inserting an element involves checking if it's already in the set (`O(1)`), adding it to the vector (`O(1)`), and updating the map (`O(1)`).
- **Remove Operation**: **O(1)**. Removing an element involves finding its index (`O(1)`), replacing it with the last element (`O(1)`), and updating both the vector and map (`O(1)`).
- **Get Random Operation**: **O(1)**. Retrieving a random element from the vector takes constant time.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the set. The space is used by the vector `a` and the unordered map `m`, both of which store the set elements.

---

### üèÅ Conclusion

The `RandomizedSet` class provides a super-efficient way to insert, remove, and retrieve random elements, all in **O(1)** time. Here's why this approach shines:

- **Insert** and **Remove** operations are fast, with no need for complex shifts or resizing (thanks to the vector).
- **Get Random** is incredibly fast because we directly access an index in the vector in constant time.
- The combination of a **vector** and an **unordered map** is key to achieving this efficiency, ensuring that we can modify and query the set without sacrificing performance.

#### üåü Key Takeaways:
- All core operations are implemented in **O(1)** time.
- The **vector** allows efficient indexing, while the **unordered map** keeps track of indices.
- This makes the `RandomizedSet` both **time-efficient** and **space-efficient** for all operations!

And there you have it! With this solution, you‚Äôve got a powerful, lightning-fast data structure to handle a dynamic set with random access. üí™
