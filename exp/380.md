### Problem Statement

In this problem, we are tasked with implementing a data structure called `RandomizedSet` which supports the following operations:

1. **Insert**: Insert a value into the set if it's not already present.
2. **Remove**: Remove a value from the set if it exists.
3. **Get Random**: Retrieve a random element from the set.

The key challenge here is that both **Insert** and **Remove** operations need to be efficient, and we must be able to retrieve random elements efficiently as well.

### Approach

To design a `RandomizedSet` that allows for efficient **Insert**, **Remove**, and **Get Random** operations, we use a combination of a **vector** and an **unordered_map**:

1. **Vector (`a`)**:
   - The vector stores the elements of the set. Since we are allowed to randomly access elements, the vector provides **O(1)** time complexity for retrieving an element by index.
   - The last element in the vector will always be used to replace a removed element, allowing us to maintain **O(1)** time complexity for removal operations.

2. **Unordered Map (`m`)**:
   - The unordered map stores the value as the **key** and the index of that value in the vector as the **value**. This allows us to check for existence in **O(1)** time and access the index of any element in **O(1)** time, which is crucial for performing fast removals.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Define the `RandomizedSet` Class
```cpp
class RandomizedSet {
private:
    vector<int> a;
    unordered_map<int, int> m;
public:
    RandomizedSet() {
    }
```
- The class `RandomizedSet` has two private members:
  - `a`: A vector that stores the elements of the set.
  - `m`: An unordered map that maps each element to its index in the vector `a`.
- The constructor `RandomizedSet()` initializes these members, with no elements initially in the set.

#### Step 2: Insert Method
```cpp
    bool insert(int val) {
        if(m.find(val) != m.end())
            return false;
        else{
            a.push_back(val);
            m[val] = a.size() - 1;
            return true;
        }
    }
```
- The `insert` method tries to insert a value `val` into the set.
- If the value already exists in the map `m`, the method returns **false** since duplicates are not allowed.
- If the value does not exist in the set:
  - It is added to the vector `a` using `push_back`.
  - The value is mapped to its index in the vector in the unordered map `m`.
- The method returns **true** if the insertion is successful.

#### Step 3: Remove Method
```cpp
    bool remove(int val) {
        if(m.find(val) == m.end())
            return false;
        else{
            int last = a.back();
            a[m[val]] = a.back();
            a.pop_back();
            m[last] = m[val];
            m.erase(val);
            return true;
        }
    }
```
- The `remove` method removes a value `val` from the set.
- If the value is not found in the map `m`, the method returns **false**.
- If the value exists:
  - It retrieves the last element of the vector `a` using `a.back()`.
  - The value to be removed (`val`) is replaced by the last element in the vector `a`, which ensures that the removal does not cause gaps in the vector and preserves the order of the elements.
  - The last element is removed from the vector using `pop_back()`.
  - The index of the last element is updated in the unordered map `m`.
  - The entry for the removed value is erased from the unordered map `m`.
- The method returns **true** if the removal is successful.

#### Step 4: Get Random Method
```cpp
    int getRandom() {
        return a[rand() % a.size()];
    }
```
- The `getRandom` method retrieves a random element from the set.
- It uses `rand() % a.size()` to generate a random index, ensuring that the generated index is within the bounds of the vector.
- The element at that index in the vector `a` is returned as the random element.
- The time complexity for this operation is **O(1)** because accessing a random element in a vector takes constant time.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Insert Operation**: **O(1)**. 
  - Inserting an element involves checking whether the element exists in the map (O(1)), adding it to the vector (O(1)), and updating the map (O(1)).
  
- **Remove Operation**: **O(1)**.
  - Removing an element involves checking if the element exists (O(1)), replacing the element in the vector with the last element (O(1)), popping the last element (O(1)), and updating the map (O(1)).
  
- **Get Random Operation**: **O(1)**.
  - Accessing a random element from the vector takes constant time.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the set. 
  - The space complexity is determined by the storage of the vector `a` and the unordered map `m`, both of which store the elements in the set.

### Conclusion

The `RandomizedSet` class provides an efficient implementation of a data structure that supports insertion, removal, and random retrieval of elements with constant time complexity for each operation.

#### Key Points:
- **Insert** and **Remove** operations are implemented in **O(1)** time, making the set efficient for dynamic modifications.
- **Get Random** is also executed in **O(1)** time, ensuring fast random access.
- The use of a **vector** for storing elements and an **unordered map** for indexing elements allows for efficient lookups and removals, without sacrificing performance.
  
Overall, this implementation provides a highly efficient and scalable solution to managing a randomized set with constant time complexity for all core operations.
