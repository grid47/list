### Problem Statement
Design a data structure that supports the following operations:
1. `insert(val)`: Inserts an item `val` into the set if not already present. Returns `true` if the item was added successfully, or `false` if it was already present.
2. `remove(val)`: Removes an item `val` from the set if present. Returns `true` if the item was removed successfully, or `false` if it was not found.
3. `getRandom()`: Returns a random element from the current set of elements. Each element must have the same probability of being returned.

### Approach
- **Data Structure**:
  - Use a dynamic array (`vector<int>`) to store the elements, allowing O(1) time complexity for adding and removing items.
  - Use a hash map (`unordered_map<int,int>`) to store the index of each element in the array for O(1) time complexity for lookup operations.

1. **Insertion**:
   - Check if the element is already present using the hash map.
   - If not present, add it to the end of the array and store its index in the hash map.

2. **Removal**:
   - Check if the element exists in the hash map.
   - If present, replace the element to be removed with the last element in the array to maintain the continuity of the array, and update the hash map accordingly.
   - Finally, remove the last element from the array.

3. **Random Selection**:
   - Use `rand()` to generate a random index and return the element at that index in the array.

### Code Walk-through
- The `RandomizedSet` class maintains the dynamic array `a` and the hash map `m`.
- `insert` method adds the value if it's not already in the set and updates the map.
- `remove` method swaps the value with the last element and updates the necessary indices in the map before removing the last element.
- `getRandom` method returns a random element from the array.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - `insert`: O(1)
  - `remove`: O(1)
  - `getRandom`: O(1)
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the set, for the array and hash map.
