### Problem Statement

The problem is to find the number of distinct names that can be formed by swapping the first letter of the given ideas. Each idea is a string, and by swapping the first letter between two different strings (i.e., changing the first character of one idea with that of another), we create a new distinct name. The goal is to calculate the number of such distinct names.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to focus on efficiently counting the distinct combinations of ideas that can be formed by swapping the first character of strings in the input list. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Grouping Ideas by the First Letter:**
   The input consists of a list of strings, each representing an idea. The first step is to group these strings based on their first character. This can be done using an array of sets, where each set holds the suffixes (the part of the string excluding the first letter) corresponding to strings that start with a particular letter. This allows us to efficiently track which suffixes are associated with which starting letters.

2. **Counting Valid Swaps:**
   Once we have the suffixes grouped by their first letter, we need to count how many valid distinct names can be created by swapping the first letters. For each pair of different letters (say `i` and `j`), we need to calculate how many suffixes from the group starting with `i` do not appear in the group starting with `j` and vice versa. The product of these counts gives the number of distinct names that can be formed by swapping ideas between the two groups.

3. **Final Count:**
   Since we are considering swapping between two different starting letters, for each valid swap between groups `i` and `j`, we calculate the number of valid swaps in both directions. Therefore, after calculating the distinct names for all pairs of different letters, we multiply the final result by 2.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Grouping Ideas by the First Letter

```cpp
unordered_set<string> count[26];
for (auto& s: ideas)
    count[s[0] - 'a'].insert(s.substr(1));
```

In this step, we initialize an array `count` of size 26 (one for each letter of the alphabet). The array holds sets of suffixes. We iterate over each idea in the `ideas` vector and:
- Extract the suffix of the idea using `s.substr(1)`, which removes the first character.
- Insert the suffix into the appropriate set in the `count` array based on the first character of the idea. The index is determined by the formula `s[0] - 'a'`, which converts the first character of the string to an index between 0 and 25 (corresponding to 'a' through 'z').

#### Step 2: Counting Valid Swaps

```cpp
long long res = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < 26; ++i)
    for(int j = i + 1; j < 26; ++j) {   
        long long c1 = 0L, c2 = 0L;
        for (auto& c: count[i])
            if (!count[j].count(c)) c1++;
        for (auto& c: count[j])
            if (!count[i].count(c)) c2++;
        res += c1 * c2;
    }
```

- We initialize `res` to store the final result.
- We then iterate through all pairs of distinct letters (i.e., pairs of `i` and `j` where `i < j`).
- For each pair, we initialize `c1` and `c2` to 0. These variables will count how many suffixes from group `i` are not present in group `j` (`c1`), and how many suffixes from group `j` are not present in group `i` (`c2`).
- The `for` loops inside count the number of suffixes in each group that do not appear in the other group. If a suffix in group `i` is not found in group `j`, we increment `c1`, and similarly for `c2`.
- Finally, we add the product `c1 * c2` to `res`. This product represents the number of valid swaps between the two groups, as we can pair each suffix from `i` that is not in `j` with each suffix from `j` that is not in `i`.

#### Step 3: Final Count and Return the Result

```cpp
return res * 2;
```

- The final result is doubled because each valid swap between groups `i` and `j` can be considered in both directions (i.e., swapping `i` with `j` and swapping `j` with `i`).
- The result is returned after multiplying by 2 to account for both directions.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The algorithm iterates over the input list of ideas, which takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the number of ideas.
- For each idea, we perform an operation that inserts the suffix into a set, which takes average `O(1)` time for each insertion. Therefore, the total time complexity for processing the input is `O(n)`.
- The nested loops over pairs of groups (`i` and `j`) run at most `26 * 25 / 2` iterations (i.e., about 325 iterations in the worst case), which is constant.
- Inside these loops, the algorithm iterates over the suffixes in each group. In the worst case, each group can contain up to `n` suffixes. Therefore, for each pair of groups, the time complexity is proportional to the sum of the sizes of the sets involved, which is at most `O(n)` in total for each iteration of the pair loops.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is determined by the space required to store the sets of suffixes. Since there are at most 26 sets (one for each letter of the alphabet) and each set can store at most `n` suffixes, the space complexity is `O(n)`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution efficiently calculates the number of distinct names that can be formed by swapping the first letters of the ideas. By leveraging hash sets to group suffixes and counting valid swaps between different groups, the algorithm achieves a time complexity of `O(n)`, making it suitable for large inputs. The solution is well-optimized in terms of both time and space, ensuring scalability and efficiency even when dealing with a large number of ideas.
