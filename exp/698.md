### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `K`. Your task is to determine if you can partition the array into `K` non-empty subsets such that the sum of each subset is the same.

### Approach
1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `nums`: A vector of integers.
   - `K`: An integer representing the number of subsets.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `K` is `1`, return `true` (any array can form a single subset).
   - If the size of `nums` is less than `K`, return `false` (not enough elements to form subsets).
   - Calculate the total sum of the array. If the total sum is not divisible by `K`, return `false`.

3. **Calculate Target Subset Sum**:
   - Determine the target sum for each subset, which is the total sum divided by `K`.

4. **State Management**:
   - Use an array `subsetSum` to keep track of the current sums of the subsets being formed.
   - Use a boolean array `taken` to track which elements have been included in the subsets.

5. **Recursive Backtracking**:
   - Start the recursive function to try to form subsets, beginning from the last element.
   - If the current subset reaches the target sum, move on to the next subset.
   - Try to add each number to the current subset and recursively check if it can lead to a valid partition.

### Code Walk-through
- The main function `canPartitionKSubsets` initializes the necessary variables and calls the recursive helper function.
- The recursive function `canPartitionKSubsets` attempts to add each unselected number to the current subset.
- If the target subset sum is reached, it moves to the next subset. If adding a number does not lead to a solution, it backtracks by removing the number from the current subset and trying the next option.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(K * 2^N) in the worst case due to the recursive nature and subset formation.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N + K) for the recursion stack and state storage.
