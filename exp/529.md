### Problem Statement
In the game of Minesweeper, you are given a board represented as a 2D grid with the following characters:
- `'E'`: Empty square
- `'M'`: Mine
- `'X'`: Revealed mine
- `'B'`: Blank square (no adjacent mines)
- `'1'` to `'8'`: Square with a number representing the count of adjacent mines

When a player clicks on an empty square, you need to reveal it and its adjacent squares based on the number of mines around it. If the square contains a mine, it should be marked with `'X'`. If there are no adjacent mines, all adjacent squares should also be revealed recursively.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Extract the number of rows `m` and columns `n` from the board.
   - Get the clicked position `(row, col)` from the `click` vector.

2. **Handle Mine Click**:
   - If the clicked square contains a mine (`'M'`), change it to `'X'` and return the board.

3. **Count Adjacent Mines**:
   - For an empty square, count the number of adjacent squares that contain mines.
   - Check all 8 possible directions around the clicked square:
     - If a direction goes out of bounds, skip it.
     - If an adjacent square is a mine or already revealed, increment the mine counter.

4. **Reveal the Square**:
   - If there are adjacent mines (`cnt > 0`), update the square with the number of adjacent mines (as a character).
   - If there are no adjacent mines, mark the square as `'B'`, and recursively reveal all adjacent squares that are still `'E'`.

5. **Return the Updated Board**:
   - After processing the click, return the modified board.

### Code Walk-through
- The function first checks if the clicked square is a mine or empty.
- If empty, it counts adjacent mines and reveals the square accordingly.
- If the square has no adjacent mines, it recursively calls itself for all adjacent empty squares.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. In the worst case, all squares may need to be processed.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) in the worst case due to the recursion stack if many squares are empty.
