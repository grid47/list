### Problem Statement
Given an array `temp` where `temp[i]` is the temperature on the `i`-th day, return an array `ans` such that `ans[i]` is the number of days you have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `ans[i]` at 0.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a stack to keep track of the indices of the temperatures. The stack will store pairs of temperature values and their corresponding indices.
   - Create an output vector `ans` initialized to 0, of the same size as the input temperature array.

2. **Iterate through the Temperatures**:
   - For each temperature `temp[i]`, check if it is greater than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack:
     - If so, pop the index from the stack, and calculate the difference between the current index `i` and the popped index to determine the number of days to wait. Store this value in `ans`.

3. **Push Current Temperature**:
   - Always push the current temperature and its index onto the stack after processing any previous temperatures.

4. **Final Cleanup**:
   - If there are any remaining indices in the stack after processing all temperatures, it means there were no warmer days for those temperatures, and they remain 0 in the `ans` vector.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, return the `ans` vector containing the results.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the main method for processing the temperature data.

- **Method**:
  - `vector<int> dailyTemperatures(vector<int>& temp)`: Implements the logic to compute the number of days to wait for a warmer temperature.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of days (length of the `temp` array), since each temperature is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) in the worst case for the stack if temperatures are in strictly increasing order.
