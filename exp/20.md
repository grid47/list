### Problem Statement
Given a string containing just the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[` and `]`, determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:
- Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets are closed in the correct order.

### Approach
1. **Use a Stack**: Utilize a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.
2. **Iterate Through Each Character**: For each character in the string:
   - If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
   - If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack:
     - If it matches, pop the stack.
     - If it doesn't match or the stack is empty, return `false`.
3. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, check if the stack is empty. If it is, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Stack Initialization**: A stack is initialized to store opening brackets.
2. **Loop Through Characters**:
   - For each character `x` in the string `s`:
     - If `x` is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
     - If `x` is a closing bracket:
       - Check if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket.
       - If it matches, pop the stack. If it doesn't match or the stack is empty, return `false`.
3. **Return Result**: After the loop, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the length of the string, as each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(N)\) in the worst case, where all characters are opening brackets, requiring space for the stack.
