### Problem Statement
You are given a list of accounts, where each account consists of a name and a list of emails. An account is represented as `["name", "email1", "email2", ...]`. Two accounts are considered the same if they have the same name and share at least one email. The goal is to merge these accounts into a single account that contains all unique emails associated with that name.

### Approach
1. **Mapping and Graph Creation**:
   - Use a map `mp` to associate each email with its corresponding name (the first element of each account).
   - Construct a graph `gph` using a set to represent connections between emails. Each email will be a node, and edges exist between all emails in the same account.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Initialize a set `seen` to keep track of visited emails.
   - For each unvisited email, perform a DFS to gather all connected emails into a temporary list `tmp`. This will effectively find all emails that belong to the same account.

3. **Sorting and Storing Results**:
   - After gathering emails, sort them, prepend the corresponding name (from the map), and add the result to the final list of merged accounts.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function**:
  - `accountsMerge(vector<vector<string>>& acc)`: Merges the accounts and returns a vector of merged accounts.
  - `dfs(vector<string> &tmp, map<string, set<string>> &gph, set<string> &seen, string node)`: A helper function that performs DFS to gather connected emails.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N), where N is the total number of emails, due to sorting the emails at the end.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the graph and the set of seen emails.
