### Problem Statement
You are given a matrix `grid` where `grid[i][j]` is 1 if student `i` and student `j` are friends (directly or indirectly), and 0 otherwise. Your task is to find the total number of friend circles. A friend circle is a group of students who are directly or indirectly friends.

### Approach
1. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - Use a Union-Find (also known as Disjoint Set Union, DSU) to manage and group students based on their friendship.
   - The Union-Find structure maintains a parent array (`par`) to track the root of each set, along with a count of groups (`grp`).

2. **Union Operation**:
   - For every pair of friends `(i, j)` found in the grid, perform the union operation to group them together. If they are already in the same group, no action is taken.

3. **Find Circle Count**:
   - The number of unique parent nodes in the `par` array after processing all friendships gives the number of friend circles.

### Code Walk-through
- The `UnionFind` class is initialized with the number of students, setting each student as their own parent initially.
- The `join` function connects two students if they are not already connected and decreases the group count.
- The `find` function returns the representative (root) of the set containing a student.
- In the `findCircleNum` method, we iterate through the friendship matrix and join friends using the Union-Find operations, then return the count of distinct groups.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the number of students, as we check each pair in the friendship matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the Union-Find parent array.
