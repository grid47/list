### Problem Statement
Given a string `str`, determine if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to check if the string can be formed by repeating a smaller substring multiple times.
   
2. **Concatenation Trick**:
   - By concatenating the string `str` with itself (`str + str`), we can create a new string where all possible repeated patterns of `str` can be found starting from different positions.
   - If `str` can be formed by repeating a substring, then within the concatenated string (excluding the first and last characters), the original string should appear.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Create a new string by concatenating `str` with itself.
   - Use `substr` to get the portion of the new string that excludes the first and last characters.
   - Check if `str` exists in this substring using the `find` method.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Concatenate the String**:
   - `(str + str)` creates a new string that contains two copies of `str`.

2. **Extract Substring**:
   - `.substr(1, str.size() * 2 - 2)` extracts a substring from index `1` to the length of the original string (minus the first and last character).

3. **Find Method**:
   - `.find(str) != -1` checks if the original string can be found in the substring created in the previous step.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `str`, as concatenation and searching in a string both take linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the space used for the concatenated string.
