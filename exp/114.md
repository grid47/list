### Problem Statement
Flatten a binary tree to a linked list in-place. The linked list should use the right child pointers and should be in the same order as a preorder traversal of the tree.

### Approach
1. Recursively traverse the tree.
2. For each node:
   - Store the original right child.
   - Move the left child to the right.
   - Set the left child to `nullptr`.
   - Find the last node on the right (after moving the left child) and connect it to the original right child.
3. Continue this process for the right child.

### Code Walk-through
- **`flatten` function**:
  - **Line 5**: If the current node (`root`) is `NULL`, return (base case).
  - **Line 7**: Store the original right child in `tmp`.
  - **Line 8**: Move the left child to the right.
  - **Line 9**: Set the left child to `nullptr`.
  - **Line 11-12**: Traverse to the end of the new right subtree.
  - **Line 14**: Connect the last node's right pointer to the stored original right child.
  - **Line 15**: Recursively flatten the right subtree.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(H)\), where \(H\) is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.
