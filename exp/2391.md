### Problem Statement

In this problem, you are tasked with determining the total time required for garbage collection in a city with several neighborhoods. You are given two inputs:

1. **`garbage`**: A list of strings where each string represents the garbage in a particular neighborhood. Each character in the string corresponds to a type of garbage (`'P'` for paper, `'G'` for glass, and `'M'` for metal).
2. **`travel`**: A list of integers where each integer represents the travel time between two consecutive neighborhoods.

The goal is to calculate the total time it will take for the garbage trucks to collect all the garbage from all neighborhoods. Each garbage truck can only collect one type of garbage, and it needs to travel to the last neighborhood that contains any garbage of its type.

You need to determine the total time required, which includes both the time taken to collect all the garbage and the travel time between neighborhoods for each truck.

### Approach

The main task is to compute the total time required for garbage collection, considering both the garbage collection time and the travel time. The solution can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Sum the Garbage Collection Times**: For each neighborhood, we sum the size of the garbage string to get the total amount of garbage that needs to be collected. This is simply the sum of the lengths of the strings in the `garbage` array.

2. **Determine the Last Occurrence of Each Garbage Type**: For each type of garbage (`'P'`, `'G'`, and `'M'`), we need to know the last neighborhood that has this type of garbage. This will help us calculate the travel time for the respective garbage truck, as the truck will need to travel to the last neighborhood containing that type of garbage.

3. **Calculate the Travel Time for Each Garbage Type**: After determining the last occurrence for each garbage type, we calculate the total travel time. The travel time for each garbage truck is the sum of the travel times between neighborhoods leading up to the last neighborhood containing that type of garbage.

4. **Add the Garbage Collection and Travel Times**: Finally, we sum the garbage collection times for all neighborhoods and the travel times for each garbage truck to get the total time required for garbage collection.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

We start by initializing an array `last` to store the last occurrence of each garbage type. The array is large enough to accommodate all possible ASCII values (128), but we only use the indices corresponding to the characters `'P'`, `'G'`, and `'M'`. We also initialize `res` to 0, which will store the total time required.

```cpp
int last[128] = {}, res = 0;
```

#### Step 2: Sum the Garbage Collection Times

Next, we loop through each neighborhood in the `garbage` array. For each neighborhood:
- We add the length of the string (the number of garbage items) to `res`.
- We then loop through each character in the string and update `last` to reflect the last occurrence of each garbage type.

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < garbage.size(); i++) {
    res += garbage[i].size();
    for(char c : garbage[i])
        last[c] = i;
}
```

In this loop:
- The `res += garbage[i].size()` line adds the number of garbage items in the current neighborhood to the total collection time.
- The nested loop `for(char c : garbage[i])` iterates through each character in the garbage string and updates the `last` array to indicate the most recent neighborhood where that type of garbage appears.

#### Step 3: Calculate Cumulative Travel Times

Next, we calculate the cumulative travel times. The `travel` array represents the travel time between consecutive neighborhoods, but to determine the total travel time for each garbage truck, we need to compute the cumulative travel time for each neighborhood. This can be done by iterating through the `travel` array and adding each element to the previous element.

```cpp
for(int j = 1; j < travel.size(); j++)
    travel[j] += travel[j - 1];
```

This loop modifies the `travel` array such that each element `travel[j]` stores the total travel time from neighborhood 0 to neighborhood `j`.

#### Step 4: Calculate Travel Time for Each Garbage Type

Now that we have the cumulative travel times, we need to calculate the total travel time for each garbage truck. We do this for each type of garbage (`'P'`, `'G'`, and `'M'`), checking the last neighborhood where that garbage type appears. If there is a neighborhood containing that garbage type (i.e., `last[c]` is non-zero), we add the travel time to `res`.

```cpp
for(int c : "PGM")
    if(last[c])
        res += travel[last[c] - 1];
```

In this loop:
- We iterate over the characters `'P'`, `'G'`, and `'M'` using `for(int c : "PGM")`.
- If the garbage truck for type `c` needs to travel (i.e., `last[c]` is not zero), we add the appropriate travel time to `res` using `res += travel[last[c] - 1]`.

The `last[c] - 1` indicates the index of the last neighborhood containing that garbage type, and `travel[last[c] - 1]` gives us the total travel time to that neighborhood.

#### Step 5: Return the Total Time

Finally, we return the computed total time, `res`.

```cpp
return res;
```

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n + m)**, where `n` is the number of neighborhoods and `m` is the maximum number of garbage items across all neighborhoods.

- The first loop that calculates the total garbage collection time (`for(int i = 0; i < garbage.size(); i++)`) runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of neighborhoods.
- The second loop that calculates the cumulative travel times (`for(int j = 1; j < travel.size(); j++)`) runs in **O(m)** time, where `m` is the number of neighborhoods minus 1 (since `travel` has one less element than `garbage`).
- The final loop that calculates the total travel time for each garbage truck runs in **O(1)** time since there are only three garbage types (`'P'`, `'G'`, and `'M'`).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n + m)**.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is **O(n)** because the algorithm uses additional space to store the `last` array and modifies the `travel` array in-place. The `last` array has a fixed size of 128, so its space usage is constant, and the space used for the `garbage` and `travel` arrays is proportional to the input size.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the total time required for garbage collection by leveraging cumulative travel times and tracking the last occurrence of each type of garbage. The time complexity is linear in relation to the number of neighborhoods and garbage items, making it scalable for large inputs. By considering both garbage collection and travel times, this algorithm ensures the garbage trucks collect all the garbage efficiently.
