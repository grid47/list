### Problem Statement
You are given a list of people, each represented by their wealth and a quietness index. The relationships between people indicate who is richer than whom. Your task is to find the quietest person among the richer people for each person.

### Approach
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Create a directed graph where an edge from person `A` to person `B` indicates that `A` is richer than `B`. This is stored in an unordered map `richer2`, where the key is a person, and the value is a vector of people who are poorer than that person.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - For each person, perform a DFS to find the quietest person among all richer people.
   - Use memoization to store results in a vector `res` to avoid redundant calculations. If the result for a person is already computed (i.e., `res[i] >= 0`), simply return it.

3. **Comparing Quietness**:
   - While performing DFS, compare the quietness index of the current person with the quietness of the richer person found through the DFS. Update the result accordingly.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all people, return the `res` vector, which contains the indices of the quietest people among the richer ones for each person.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N + R), where N is the number of people and R is the number of relationships. Each person and relationship is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for storing the richer relationships and the results.
