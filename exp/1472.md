### Problem Statement

The task is to implement a `BrowserHistory` class that simulates the behavior of a web browser's history. The class should allow users to visit new pages, go back a certain number of steps in history, and move forward a certain number of steps. The requirements for the class methods are as follows:

1. **Initialization**: The browser history should start with a single homepage.
2. **Visit**: When a user visits a new URL, it should be added to the browsing history, and the forward history should be cleared.
3. **Back**: The user should be able to go back in history by a specified number of steps, ensuring they cannot go further back than the homepage.
4. **Forward**: The user should also be able to move forward in history by a specified number of steps, ensuring they cannot go beyond the most recently visited page.

### Approach

To effectively implement the browser history functionality, we can use two stacks (or vectors in this case) to manage the back and forward history:

- **Backward History (bwd)**: This will store all the URLs visited in the order they were accessed, allowing us to go back in history.
- **Forward History (fwd)**: This will store the URLs that the user can navigate forward to after going back.

The basic operations can be described as follows:

1. **Visit**: Add a new URL to the backward history and clear the forward history.
2. **Back**: Remove the last URL from the backward history (if not at the homepage) and add it to the forward history.
3. **Forward**: Remove the last URL from the forward history (if available) and add it back to the backward history.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the provided code for the `BrowserHistory` class:

1. **Class Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   class BrowserHistory {
   ```
   - The `BrowserHistory` class is defined to encapsulate the browser's history functionalities.

2. **Member Variables**:
   ```cpp
   vector<string> fwd, bwd;
   ```
   - Two vectors are declared:
     - `fwd`: To store URLs available for forward navigation.
     - `bwd`: To store the browsing history for backward navigation.

3. **Constructor**:
   ```cpp
   BrowserHistory(string homepage) {
       bwd.push_back(homepage);
       fwd.resize(0);
   }
   ```
   - The constructor initializes the browsing history by adding the homepage to the backward vector and ensuring the forward vector is empty.

4. **Visit Method**:
   ```cpp
   void visit(string url) {
       bwd.push_back(url);
       fwd.resize(0);
   }
   ```
   - The `visit` method is responsible for:
     - Adding the new `url` to the end of the `bwd` vector.
     - Clearing the `fwd` vector since the user cannot go forward after visiting a new page.

5. **Back Method**:
   ```cpp
   string back(int steps) {
       int x = bwd.size();
       while(steps-- > 0 && bwd.size() > 1) {
           string p = bwd.back();
           fwd.push_back(p);
           bwd.pop_back();
       }
       return bwd.back();
   }
   ```
   - The `back` method allows the user to navigate backward:
     - A loop runs for the number of steps specified or until the user reaches the homepage (when there is only one URL in `bwd`).
     - The last URL is removed from `bwd`, added to `fwd`, and the method returns the current page after all valid back operations.

6. **Forward Method**:
   ```cpp
   string forward(int steps) {
       int x = fwd.size();
       while(steps-- > 0 && fwd.size() > 0) {
           string p = fwd.back();
           bwd.push_back(p);
           fwd.pop_back();
       }
       return bwd.back();        
   }
   ```
   - The `forward` method allows the user to move forward in history:
     - Similar to `back`, a loop runs for the specified steps or until there are no more URLs in `fwd`.
     - The last URL is removed from `fwd`, added back to `bwd`, and the current page is returned.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The time complexity for each of the methods (`visit`, `back`, and `forward`) is \(O(1)\) on average. However, in the worst case, the `back` and `forward` methods can take \(O(n)\) if all URLs are traversed, where \(n\) is the number of URLs in the respective history.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for storing the browsing history in the backward and forward vectors.

### Conclusion

The provided implementation of the `BrowserHistory` class effectively simulates the basic functionalities of a web browser's history. Key features of this implementation include:

1. **Two-Pointer Approach**: By using two vectors to manage forward and backward navigation, the code remains clean and efficient.
2. **Dynamic Size Management**: The vectors dynamically resize as URLs are added or removed, maintaining optimal performance without fixed-size limitations.
3. **Robustness**: The code correctly handles edge cases such as navigating back from the homepage or forward when no forward history exists.

This solution serves as an excellent reference for understanding how to implement a history management system for a browser-like application, providing insights into stack-based data management and user navigation logic. The clear structure and efficient handling of browser actions make it a strong candidate for educational purposes in data structures and algorithms.
