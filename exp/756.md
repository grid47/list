### Problem Statement
You are tasked with building a pyramid where each block of the pyramid consists of a string. The bottom row of the pyramid is given as `bottom`, and you have a list of allowed transitions represented by strings in the `allowed` vector. Each string in `allowed` indicates that if you have two blocks in the current row, you can place a specific block above them in the next row. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to build the pyramid all the way to the top.

### Approach
1. **Data Structure**:
   - Use an unordered map to store the allowed blocks that can be placed on top of pairs of blocks from the current row.

2. **Recursive Helper Function**:
   - Define a recursive function `helper` that checks whether it is possible to transition from the current `bottom` row to the next row.
   - The function parameters include:
     - `bottom`: the current row of the pyramid.
     - `m`: the map of allowed transitions.
     - `start`: the current index being processed in the `bottom`.
     - `next`: the blocks that will form the next row.
   - If the size of `bottom` reaches 1, return `true`, indicating that the pyramid can be completed.
   - If the current `bottom` has already been processed and is invalid, return `false`.

3. **Transition Logic**:
   - If the end of the `bottom` row is reached, recursively call the helper function for the next row, checking if the transition can be made. If not, mark the `next` configuration as invalid.
   - For each valid pair of blocks in `bottom`, try to add each allowed block from the map and recursively check if it leads to a successful configuration.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to determine if the pyramid can be built.

- **Method**:
  - `bool pyramidTransition(string bottom, vector<string>& allowed)`: Prepares the data structures and initiates the helper function to check the pyramid construction.

- **Helper Function**:
  - `bool helper(string bottom, unordered_map<string, vector<char>>& m, int start, string next)`: Recursively attempts to build the pyramid by exploring all valid transitions.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(3^n) in the worst case, where `n` is the size of the `bottom` string, due to the branching factor of possible transitions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the recursion stack and additional space used for storing invalid configurations.
