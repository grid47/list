### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` containing jumbled letters, return a string representing the digits from `0` to `9` that can be formed using the letters in `s`. Each digit is represented by its corresponding number.

### Approach
1. **Distinct Characters Identification**: 
   - Use distinct characters that uniquely identify each digit:
     - 'z' for "zero" (0)
     - 'w' for "two" (2)
     - 'u' for "four" (4)
     - 'x' for "six" (6)
     - 'g' for "eight" (8)
     - 'o' for "one" (1) (after counting 'zero', 'two', and 'four')
     - 'r' for "three" (3) (after counting 'four')
     - 'f' for "five" (5) (after counting 'four')
     - 'v' for "seven" (7) (after counting 'five')
     - 'i' for "nine" (9) (after counting 'five', 'six', and 'eight')
2. **Character Counting**: Create a frequency count of all characters in the input string `s`.
3. **Digit Counting**:
   - For each unique character, determine how many times the corresponding digit can be formed based on the character's frequency.
   - Decrease the count of each character in the frequency array based on the letters used to form each digit.
4. **Result Compilation**: Append the digits to the result string according to their counts.
5. **Sorting**: Sort the result string before returning, to ensure the digits are in ascending order.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: Define vectors for the words representing digits, their corresponding numbers, and distinct characters.
2. **Character Frequency Count**: Loop through the input string to count occurrences of each letter.
3. **Counting Digits**: For each digit, determine how many times it can be formed and update the counts accordingly.
4. **Building Result**: Construct the result string by appending the digit characters as needed and sort it.
5. **Return Result**: Finally, return the sorted string of digits.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m log m), where `n` is the length of the input string `s` (for counting characters) and `m` is the number of digits (which is constant). Sorting a string of digits has a negligible impact since the maximum length is limited to 10.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the frequency counts and fixed vectors, as they are limited to 26 letters and 10 digits.
