### Problem Statement

We are given two strings `num1` and `num2` representing two integers, as well as two integers `min_sum` and `max_sum`. The task is to count how many integers `x` exist in the range from `num1` to `num2` (inclusive) such that the sum of the digits of `x` lies between `min_sum` and `max_sum` (inclusive). The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Approach

To solve this problem, we employ a dynamic programming approach that efficiently counts the valid numbers within a given range that meet the specified sum of digits condition. This problem can be framed as a digit DP (Dynamic Programming) problem, where we keep track of several conditions at each step:

1. **Current Index of Digits**: We process the digits of the numbers from left to right.
2. **Tightness of the Boundaries**: We maintain whether we are still tightly bound to the current digit in either `num1` or `num2` while considering the digits.
3. **Current Sum of Digits**: We track the running sum of digits as we move through the digits.

To solve this, we break down the solution into manageable components using recursive dynamic programming. The approach is based on counting valid numbers from 0 to `num2`, and then subtracting the count of valid numbers from 0 to `num1-1`, effectively computing the count of valid numbers in the range `[num1, num2]`.

### Code Breakdown

#### Step 1: Initialization of DP Table

```cpp
int dp[24][2][2][401];
string n1, n2;
int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
```

- `dp[idx][t1][t2][net]`: A 4D dynamic programming array that stores the results for different states:
  - `idx`: The current index (position in the string) we are processing.
  - `t1`: A boolean representing whether we are still tightly bound to `num1` at this position.
  - `t2`: A boolean representing whether we are still tightly bound to `num2` at this position.
  - `net`: The remaining sum of digits that we are trying to achieve.
  
  The array is initialized to size 24, because the maximum length of the input strings is 24. The value `401` represents the maximum sum of digits we might encounter (since the largest possible sum is 9 times the length of the number, and `9 * 24 = 216`, we account for some buffer).

#### Step 2: Recursive `sum` Function

```cpp
int sum(int idx, bool t1, bool t2, int net) {
    if(net < 0) return 0;
    if(idx == n1.size()) return 1;
    
    if(dp[idx][t1][t2][net] != -1) return dp[idx][t1][t2][net];
    
    int st = t1 ? n1[idx] - '0' : 0;
    int ed = t2 ? n2[idx] - '0' : 9;
    int cnt = 0;
    for(int i = st; i <= ed; i++) {
        cnt = (long) (cnt + sum(idx + 1, t1 && (i == st), t2 && (i == ed), net - i)) % mod;
    }
    return dp[idx][t1][t2][net] = cnt;
}
```

This recursive function is the core of the solution and performs the following tasks:
1. **Base Case**: If the remaining sum (`net`) is less than 0, it’s not a valid configuration, so return 0. If `idx` equals the size of `n1`, we have processed all digits and check if the sum condition is met.
2. **Memoization**: If this state (`idx, t1, t2, net`) has already been computed, return the stored value to avoid redundant calculations.
3. **Digit Range Calculation**: Based on whether we are tightly bound to `num1` (`t1`) or `num2` (`t2`), we determine the possible range of digits (`st` to `ed`) we can use at the current index. If we are tightly bound, the digits must be within the respective boundaries of `num1` and `num2`.
4. **Recursive Calls**: For each possible digit (`i` from `st` to `ed`), we recursively calculate the number of valid numbers that can be formed for the next index with the updated sum (`net - i`). The tightness conditions (`t1` and `t2`) are updated accordingly.

#### Step 3: Main Function (`count`)

```cpp
int count(string num1, string num2, int min_sum, int max_sum) {
    num1 = string(num2.size() - num1.size(), '0') + num1;
    
    n1 = num1;
    n2 = num2;
    
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    
    int res = sum(0, 1, 1, max_sum);
    res -= sum(0, 1, 1, min_sum - 1);
    return res;
}
```

- **Padding `num1`**: If `num1` is shorter than `num2`, we pad `num1` with leading zeros so that both numbers have the same length. This ensures that we treat them as numbers of the same length during processing.
- **Resetting `dp` Table**: We initialize the DP table to `-1` to indicate that no states have been calculated yet.
- **Calling `sum`**: We first calculate the number of valid numbers with a sum of digits ≤ `max_sum` and then subtract the count of valid numbers with a sum of digits ≤ `min_sum - 1`. The difference gives the count of valid numbers in the range `[min_sum, max_sum]`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is dominated by the recursion with memoization:
- **State Transitions**: For each position in the string, we explore digits from 0 to 9 (a maximum of 10 options per state). Therefore, at each state, we perform a recursive call with 10 possibilities.
- The number of states is determined by the length of the strings (`n`), the possible tightness conditions (2 for each of `t1` and `t2`), and the sum of digits (up to `max_sum`).

Thus, the time complexity is approximately **O(n * 2 * 2 * max_sum * 10)**, where `n` is the length of the number strings, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of digits, and the factor of 10 comes from the loop over digits. Given that `n` can be at most 24, this approach is efficient for typical input sizes.

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(n * 2 * 2 * max_sum)** due to the DP table, which stores results for each combination of index, tightness conditions, and remaining sum.

### Conclusion

This solution uses dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently count the number of integers in a given range that satisfy a specific sum of digits constraint. By using a recursive approach with careful tracking of the tightness of the boundaries (`num1` and `num2`), the algorithm computes the result in an optimal manner. The approach handles both large numbers and constraints on the sum of digits effectively, making it suitable for competitive programming scenarios.
