### Problem Statement
Given a grid representing a network where `grid[i][j]` is `1` if there is a direct connection between node `i` and node `j`, and a list of initially infected nodes (malware), the goal is to determine which node to remove to minimize the spread of malware.

### Approach
1. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - Implement a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) structure to group connected nodes together.
   - Each node will point to its parent, and the rank will help in union operations to keep the tree flat.

2. **Identify Good Nodes**:
   - Create a set of bad (infected) nodes and a set of good nodes (non-infected).
   - For each pair of good nodes that are connected, join them in the Union-Find structure.

3. **Track Malware Influence**:
   - For each infected node, determine which connected components of good nodes it influences.
   - Count the degree of influence for each component (i.e., how many malware nodes are connected to it).

4. **Evaluate Each Malware Node**:
   - For each malware node, calculate how many good nodes it can influence uniquely (i.e., connected components with only one malware connection).
   - Track the malware node that maximally influences good nodes, prioritizing the smallest node index in case of a tie.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Return the node that should be removed to minimize the spread of malware.

### Code Walk-through
- Initialize Union-Find structure and categorize nodes into bad and good.
- Join good nodes based on connections.
- For each malware node, determine its influence on the good nodes and count how many are uniquely connected.
- Find the node with the maximum unique influence and return it.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2) in the worst case, where N is the number of nodes, due to the nested loop checking connections and unions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing parent and rank information in the Union-Find structure.
