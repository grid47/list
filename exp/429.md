### Problem Statement
Given an N-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. Nary-Tree is a tree data structure where each node can have multiple children.

### Approach
1. **Node Definition**: Each node has:
   - An integer `val` representing the value of the node.
   - A vector `children` containing pointers to its child nodes.

2. **Level Order Traversal**:
   - Utilize a helper function to perform a recursive depth-first traversal of the tree.
   - Maintain the current level as you traverse down the tree, adding node values to the corresponding level in the result.

3. **Handling Levels**:
   - Check if the current level already exists in the result. If not, create a new vector for that level.
   - Append the current node's value to the appropriate level vector.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Level Order Function**:
   - Checks if the root is null. If it is, return an empty vector.
   - Initializes the result vector `ans` and calls the helper function `levelOrderT`.

2. **Helper Function (levelOrderT)**:
   - Adds the current node's value to the result based on its level.
   - Recursively calls itself for each child of the current node, increasing the level by one.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H) for the recursion stack, where H is the height of the tree. The space required for storing the result is also O(N) in the worst case when the tree is completely unbalanced.
