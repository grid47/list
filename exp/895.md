### Problem Statement
Implement a frequency stack that supports the following operations:
- `push(val)`: Push an integer `val` onto the stack.
- `pop()`: Remove and return the most frequent element in the stack. If there is a tie, the most recently added element among the most frequent ones is removed.

### Approach
1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use an unordered map (`freq`) to count the frequency of each element.
   - Use another unordered map (`m`) where the key is the frequency, and the value is a stack of elements that have that frequency.
   - Maintain a variable (`maxFreq`) to track the maximum frequency.

2. **Operations**:
   - **Push**:
     - Increment the frequency of the pushed value and update `maxFreq`.
     - Push the value onto the stack corresponding to its frequency.
   - **Pop**:
     - Retrieve the top value from the stack corresponding to `maxFreq`.
     - Decrement its frequency and remove it from the stack.
     - If the stack for that frequency is empty, decrement `maxFreq`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class FreqStack`: Contains methods to manage the frequency stack.
    - `FreqStack()`: Constructor to initialize the frequency stack.
    - `void push(int val)`: Method to push a value onto the stack.
    - `int pop()`: Method to pop and return the most frequent element.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for both `push` and `pop` operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the stack, to store their frequencies and stacks.
