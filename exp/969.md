## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `arr`, perform a series of "pancake flips" to sort the array in ascending order. A pancake flip reverses the order of the first `k` elements of the array. The goal is to return a list of flip operations (represented by their `k` values) that sorts the array.

## Approach
1. **Sorting by Largest to Smallest**:
   - Start from the largest unsorted number in `arr` and move down to the smallest.
   - For each number `x` (starting from the largest):
     - **Find the Position of `x`**: Use a loop to find the index `i` where `x` is located.
     - **Flip to Bring `x` to the Front**: If `x` is not already at the front (`i > 0`), perform a flip to move it to the front. Append `i + 1` to the result list `res`.
     - **Flip to Move `x` to Its Final Position**: Flip the first `x` elements to move `x` to its final sorted position in the array. Append `x` to `res`.

2. **Result**:
   - Repeat the above steps until the array is sorted in ascending order.
   - The list `res` will contain the sequence of flips needed to achieve the sorted array.

## Code Walk-through
- **Initialize `res`**: To store the sequence of flips.
- **Outer Loop**: Iterate from `x = arr.size()` down to `1`.
- **Inner Loop**: Find the index `i` of the current target number `x` in the unsorted part of `arr`.
- **Flips**:
  - Flip the first `i + 1` elements to move `x` to the front.
  - Flip the first `x` elements to move `x` to its final sorted position.
- **Return**: The list `res` with all flip operations.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), as we potentially scan and flip a portion of the array `n` times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements, for storing the flip operations in `res`.

This approach simulates pancake sorting by sequentially positioning each element from the largest to the smallest in its correct place.
