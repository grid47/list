### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to sort an array using a specific operation called the "pancake flip." The operation consists of choosing an index `i` and flipping the subarray from index `0` to `i`, reversing the order of the elements in that subarray. The goal is to return the sequence of flips required to sort the array in ascending order.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can employ a greedy approach by always placing the largest unsorted element at its correct position through two flips:
1. **Find the largest element**: Identify the largest unsorted element.
2. **Flip the largest element to the front**: Move the largest element to the front of the array by flipping the portion of the array up to that element.
3. **Flip the largest element to its correct position**: Then, flip the entire portion of the array up to the current unsorted boundary to move the largest element to its correct sorted position.
4. **Repeat**: After each flip, reduce the unsorted boundary by 1, since the largest element is now correctly placed at the end.

This approach ensures that we gradually build the sorted array, starting from the largest element and progressively moving smaller elements into place.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> pancakeSort(vector<int>& arr) {
```
1. **Function Declaration**:
   - We declare the function `pancakeSort`, which takes a reference to a vector `arr` (the array to be sorted) and returns a vector of integers that represents the sequence of flips performed.

```cpp
        vector<int> res;
```
2. **Result Vector**:
   - We initialize an empty vector `res`, which will store the sequence of flip indices.

```cpp
        int i;
```
3. **Variable Declaration**:
   - The variable `i` will be used to store the index of the largest unsorted element during each iteration of the loop.

```cpp
        for(int x = arr.size(); x > 0; x--) {
```
4. **Outer Loop**:
   - We start an outer loop with `x` iterating from the size of the array down to `1`. The value `x` represents the current size of the unsorted portion of the array.
   - The loop continues until `x` becomes 1, indicating that the entire array is sorted.

```cpp
            for(i = 0; arr[i] != x; i++) {};
```
5. **Finding the Largest Element**:
   - In each iteration of the outer loop, we search for the index `i` of the largest unsorted element, which is `x`. We do this by iterating through the array until we find the element `x`. 
   - This ensures that we can perform the necessary flips to place the largest unsorted element at its correct position.

```cpp
            reverse(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + i + 1);
```
6. **Flip the Largest Element to the Front**:
   - Once we have identified the largest unsorted element at index `i`, we flip the portion of the array from index `0` to `i`. This moves the largest element to the front of the array.

```cpp
            res.push_back(i + 1);
```
7. **Record the First Flip**:
   - After performing the flip, we record the index `i + 1` (since the flip is from index 0 to index `i`) in the result vector `res`.

```cpp
            reverse(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + x);
```
8. **Flip the Largest Element to Its Correct Position**:
   - Next, we flip the entire unsorted portion of the array, from index `0` to index `x-1`. This places the largest element at its correct sorted position at index `x-1`.

```cpp
            res.push_back(x);
```
9. **Record the Second Flip**:
   - After the second flip, we record the index `x` in the result vector `res`, which indicates the flip operation that places the largest element in its correct position.

```cpp
        }
```
10. **End of Outer Loop**:
   - This ends the outer loop. At the end of each iteration, the largest unsorted element is correctly placed at the end of the current unsorted portion of the array.

```cpp
        return res;
    }
};
```
11. **Return the Result**:
   - After completing the sorting process, we return the result vector `res`, which contains the sequence of flip indices required to sort the array.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The time complexity is **O(N^2)**, where `N` is the number of elements in the array. This is because, in each iteration of the outer loop, we perform a linear scan to find the largest element (`O(N)`), and each flip operation (`reverse`) also takes linear time (`O(N)`). Thus, the total time complexity is `O(N * N)`, which is quadratic.

- **Space Complexity**: 
  - The space complexity is **O(N)** due to the space used by the result vector `res` that stores the sequence of flip operations. No additional space is used except for the result and a few helper variables (`i` and `x`), so the space complexity is linear.

### Conclusion

The pancake sorting problem provides an interesting challenge where we are tasked with sorting an array using only "flip" operations. This approach leverages a greedy strategy to iteratively place the largest unsorted element at its correct position by using two flips: one to bring the largest element to the front and another to move it to its correct position. Although the solution has a quadratic time complexity, it is simple and intuitive, making it a good approach for small to medium-sized arrays. The space complexity is linear, which is optimal for this problem.
