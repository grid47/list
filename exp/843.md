### Problem Statement
You are given a list of `words` and a `Master` API to guess a secret word. The `Master` API provides feedback on how many characters in the guessed word match the secret word at the same positions. Your goal is to find the secret word by making guesses.

### Approach
1. **Overlap Calculation**:
   - Create a function `overlap` that calculates the best candidate word from the list based on character frequencies in their respective positions.
   - Maintain a frequency count of characters for each of the 6 positions across all words.
   - Choose the word that maximizes the overlap with the frequency counts.

2. **Tally Matching Characters**:
   - Implement a function `tally` that compares two words and counts how many characters are the same at the same positions.

3. **Main Guessing Logic**:
   - Use the `findSecretWord` method to guess the secret word iteratively.
   - Start with the initial list of words and make guesses using the `Master` API.
   - Each time a guess is made, filter the list of words based on the feedback (number of matching characters) from the `Master`.

4. **Stopping Condition**:
   - Continue guessing until the guess is fully correct (i.e., when the number of matching characters is 6).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2) in the worst case, where N is the number of words, as we might compare each word with every other word.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the list of words and the character frequency counts.
