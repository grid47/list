### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value. If the target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Approach
1. **Use of Binary Search**:
   - Utilize `lower_bound` to find the first occurrence of the target.
   - Utilize `upper_bound` to find the position just after the last occurrence of the target.

2. **Lower Bound**:
   - `lower_bound` returns an iterator pointing to the first element that is not less than the target.

3. **Upper Bound**:
   - `upper_bound` returns an iterator pointing to the first element that is greater than the target.

4. **Check for Existence**:
   - If `it1` (the result of `lower_bound`) is equal to `nums.end()` or the element pointed to by `it1` is not equal to the target, return `[-1, -1]` indicating the target is not present.

5. **Return the Range**:
   - Return the indices of the first and last occurrence of the target.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Finding the First Position**: 
   - Use `lower_bound` to get the first position of the target.
2. **Finding the Last Position**:
   - Use `upper_bound` to get the position just after the last occurrence.
3. **Checking Validity**:
   - Validate if the target exists in the array.
4. **Index Calculation**:
   - Convert iterators to indices to return the required range.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(\log n)\) for both `lower_bound` and `upper_bound`.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) as no additional space is used.
