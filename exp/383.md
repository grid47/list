### Problem Statement
Given two strings, `ransomNote` and `magazine`, determine if the `ransomNote` can be constructed using the letters from the `magazine`. Each letter in the magazine can only be used once in the ransom note.

### Approach
To solve this problem, we will use a frequency count for the characters in the `magazine` string. The steps are as follows:

1. **Character Counting**:
   - Use a hash map (or `std::map` in C++) to count the occurrences of each character in the `magazine`.

2. **Ransom Note Construction**:
   - Iterate through each character in the `ransomNote`.
   - For each character, check if it exists in the frequency map.
   - If it does, decrement its count in the map. If the count reaches zero, remove the character from the map.
   - If a character in the `ransomNote` is not found in the map, return `false`.

3. **Completion Check**:
   - If all characters in `ransomNote` can be matched with those in `magazine`, return `true`.

### Code Walk-through
- The `canConstruct` function:
  - Initializes a map to count characters from `magazine`.
  - Checks each character in `ransomNote` against the map and updates the counts accordingly.
  
### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m + n), where `m` is the length of `magazine` and `n` is the length of `ransomNote`. This is because we process both strings once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the space used by the map is constant with respect to the number of unique characters (limited to 26 for lowercase English letters).
