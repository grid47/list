### Problem Statement

In this problem, we are tasked with implementing a calendar system that allows us to book events. Each event is defined by a start and end time, and we need to ensure that no two events overlap. The objective is to design a calendar system where we can efficiently check if a new event can be scheduled and, if so, add it to the calendar.

### Approach

The key challenge is to efficiently check if a new event overlaps with any previously booked event. We can achieve this by using a **map (or balanced binary search tree)** to store the end times as the keys and the start times as the values. This allows for efficient lookups and insertion operations.

#### Steps:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We maintain a `map<int, int> mp` where the keys represent the end time of booked events, and the values represent the corresponding start time of those events. This ensures that the events are stored in chronological order based on their end times.
   
2. **Booking an Event**:
   - For each new event, we check if there is any existing event that overlaps with it. We do this by looking for the first event whose start time is after the new event's start time using `upper_bound(start)` function on the map. This gives us an iterator pointing to the first event that starts after the proposed start time of the new event.
   - If such an event exists, we then check if the end time of this event is before the proposed end time of the new event. If it is, then the events overlap, and we return `false` to indicate that the booking is not possible.
   - If no overlap is found, we can safely add the new event to the calendar by inserting it into the map with its end time as the key.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The `book` function returns `true` if the event was successfully booked, otherwise, it returns `false` if the event overlaps with an already existing one.

This approach allows for efficient insertion and overlap checking by leveraging the properties of the `map` (balanced tree structure) that ensures logarithmic time complexity for both operations.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. **Constructor `MyCalendar`**

```cpp
MyCalendar() {
    // Constructor initializes the calendar system
}
```
- The constructor initializes an empty `map<int, int> mp`, which will be used to store events.
  
#### 2. **Booking Function `book`**

```cpp
bool book(int start, int end) {
    // Find the first event that starts after the proposed start time
    auto nxt = mp.upper_bound(start);
    
    // Check if the next event starts before the current event ends (overlap check)
    if (nxt != mp.end() && (*nxt).second < end) {
        return false;  // If overlap exists, return false
    }
    
    // If no overlap, insert the event into the map
    mp[end] = start;
    return true;  // Booking was successful
}
```
- **`auto nxt = mp.upper_bound(start)`**: Finds the first event whose start time is greater than `start`. The `upper_bound` function returns an iterator pointing to the first element whose key is greater than `start`.
- **Overlap check**: We then check if the `nxt` event starts before the proposed event's end time. If it does, it means there is an overlap, and we return `false`.
- **Booking**: If no overlap is found, we add the new event to the `map` with `end` as the key and `start` as the value, indicating that this event has been booked.
- **Return `true`**: If the event is successfully booked, we return `true`.

#### 3. **Helper Functions (Upper Bound and Insert)**
The `upper_bound` function is provided by the map to perform a binary search on the keys. It efficiently finds the first element that is greater than the specified start time.

```cpp
auto nxt = mp.upper_bound(start);
```

This allows us to avoid scanning through the entire map and efficiently check for overlaps. The map ensures that all keys (end times) are stored in sorted order, allowing us to perform binary search in **O(log n)** time complexity.

#### 4. **`MyCalendar` Object Usage**

```cpp
MyCalendar* obj = new MyCalendar();
bool param_1 = obj->book(start, end);
```
- **Instantiating the calendar**: An object `obj` of type `MyCalendar` is created.
- **Booking an event**: The `book` function is called with the start and end times of the new event. The result (`true` or `false`) is stored in `param_1`.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **`book` function**: The primary operations in the `book` function are:
  - **Finding the next event**: `upper_bound(start)` takes **O(log n)** time where `n` is the number of events booked so far. This operation performs a binary search in the map to find the correct position.
  - **Insertion into the map**: Inserting a new element into the `map` also takes **O(log n)** time due to the balanced tree structure of the map.
  - Overall, the time complexity for the `book` function is **O(log n)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is determined by the size of the `map` that stores the events. In the worst case, when all events are booked without overlap, the map will store `n` events. Therefore, the space complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of events booked.

### Conclusion

The `MyCalendar` class effectively solves the problem of booking events without overlap using a `map` to store the events and efficiently check for possible overlaps. The approach leverages the properties of a balanced tree to achieve efficient booking operations with logarithmic time complexity for both insertion and overlap checking. This makes the solution scalable and performant for large inputs.

#### Key Points:
- **Efficient overlap checking**: By using a `map`, we can check for overlaps in **O(log n)** time.
- **Balanced tree structure**: The `map` maintains the events in sorted order, making insertions and lookups efficient.
- **Space and time efficiency**: The solution efficiently uses space and time resources, with complexities of **O(log n)** for each booking operation and **O(n)** space for storing events.

This design is optimal for scenarios where frequent event bookings and overlap checks are needed. It provides a clean and efficient way to manage a calendar with minimal overhead.
