### Problem Statement
Design a calendar system that allows scheduling events. Each event has a start and end time, and no two events can overlap.

### Approach
1. **Data Structure**:
   - Use a `map<int, int>` to store the end times of booked events as keys, with their corresponding start times as values.

2. **Booking an Event**:
   - For each booking request, check if the event can be scheduled without overlapping existing events.
   - Use `upper_bound` to find the next booked event that starts after the requested start time.
   - If the next booked event exists and its start time is less than the requested end time, the booking fails (overlap).
   - If no overlap is found, record the booking by adding the end time as a key and the start time as its value.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**: 
  - `class MyCalendar`: Implements the booking system.
  - **Constructor**: Initializes the calendar system.
  - **Method**: 
    - `bool book(int start, int end)`: Attempts to book an event from `start` to `end`. Returns `true` if successful, `false` otherwise.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log N) for each booking due to the map operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing booked events, where N is the number of bookings.
