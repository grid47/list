### Problem Statement

The problem requires you to find the minimum possible length of an array after performing a series of removals. In each removal, you can remove one element from the array, and the goal is to determine the smallest array length that can remain, given that each element can be removed multiple times. The key condition for removals is that at least one element must remain, and it should be the most frequent element in the array. If multiple elements are equally frequent, they all count toward the removal.

The goal is to compute this minimum length after possible removals.

### Approach

The key observation here is that the problem hinges on the frequency of the elements. If any element occurs more than half the time in the array, the remaining array size will be determined by how many times that element appears. If no element occurs more than half the time, then the remaining array length depends on whether the number of elements is odd or even.

#### Steps:

1. **Count the frequency of each element**: 
   - The first step is to compute the frequency of each element in the array. This can be easily achieved using a hash map (unordered_map) where the key is the element and the value is its frequency.

2. **Find the most frequent element**:
   - Once we have the frequency of all elements, the next step is to identify the most frequent element in the array. This will give us an idea of how many elements we can remove. The more frequent an element is, the fewer the remaining elements will be after removal.

3. **Check if any element occurs more than half the time**:
   - If the maximum frequency of any element is greater than half the size of the array, then the remaining length is determined by the most frequent element. Specifically, the result will be `2 * max_frequency - n`, where `n` is the size of the array.

4. **Handle cases where no element occurs more than half the time**:
   - If no element occurs more than half the time, the result depends on whether the array size is odd or even:
     - If the size is odd, the minimum length will be `1`.
     - If the size is even, the minimum length will be `0`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Count Frequency of Elements
```cpp
unordered_map<int, int> mp;
for (int i : nums) {
    mp[i]++;
}
```
- We iterate over the array `nums`, and for each element, we increment its count in the map `mp`.
- This step ensures we have the frequency of each element in the array.

#### Step 2: Find Maximum Frequency
```cpp
int maxi = 0;
for (auto it : mp) {
    maxi = max(maxi, it.second);
}
```
- We iterate over the map `mp` to find the maximum frequency (`maxi`), i.e., the highest count of any element.
- This tells us the most frequent element in the array.

#### Step 3: Case 1 – No Element Occurs More Than Half the Time
```cpp
if (maxi <= n / 2) {
    if (n % 2) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}
```
- If the maximum frequency (`maxi`) is less than or equal to half of the array size (`n / 2`), then no element dominates the array.
- If the size of the array is odd (`n % 2 == 1`), then the minimum length after removal will be `1` (because we can only leave one element). 
- If the size of the array is even (`n % 2 == 0`), then the minimum length after removal will be `0` (since we can remove all elements in pairs).

#### Step 4: Case 2 – An Element Occurs More Than Half the Time
```cpp
return 2 * maxi - n;
```
- If the maximum frequency (`maxi`) of any element is greater than half the size of the array (`n / 2`), then the minimum length after removal is determined by how much of the array can be removed based on this most frequent element.
- The minimum length left is calculated as `2 * max_frequency - n`. This is because the most frequent element can "dominate" and leave the rest to be removed.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We iterate over the array once to compute the frequency of each element and once more to find the maximum frequency. So, the total time complexity is linear with respect to the number of elements in the input array, i.e., O(n), where `n` is the size of the array.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We use an unordered map (`mp`) to store the frequency of each element. In the worst case, where all elements in the array are unique, the space complexity will be O(n), where `n` is the number of unique elements in the array.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently calculates the minimum length of the array after removals by leveraging the frequency of the elements in the array. The approach ensures that we can handle even large arrays in linear time, making it optimal for typical constraints in competitive programming or interview scenarios. The key idea is that if no element occurs more than half the time, the result depends on whether the array size is odd or even. If an element occurs more than half the time, the remaining length is determined by how many times the most frequent element appears. This solution is both time-efficient and space-efficient, with a complexity of O(n).
