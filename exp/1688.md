### Problem Statement

The problem involves determining the total number of matches played in a knockout tournament where `n` teams compete. In each round, each match results in one team being eliminated. The objective is to calculate how many matches are played until only one team remains, given that:

- If there is an odd number of teams, one team automatically advances to the next round without playing a match.
- If there is an even number of teams, all teams participate in matches.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If there are `0` teams (`n == 0`), no matches can occur, so the result is `0`.
   - If there is `1` team (`n == 1`), again, no matches can be played, resulting in `0`.

2. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - For each round, if `n` teams participate:
     - If `n` is even, all teams will play in pairs, resulting in `n / 2` matches, and the tournament continues with `n / 2` teams advancing.
     - If `n` is odd, there will be `n / 2` matches, and one team automatically advances, leading to `(n / 2 + 1)` teams in the next round.

3. **Combine Results**:
   - The total number of matches played is the sum of matches from the current round and matches played in subsequent rounds.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here is a detailed breakdown of the implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfMatches(int n) {
```
- **Class Definition**: We define a class `Solution` with a public method `numberOfMatches` that accepts an integer `n`, representing the number of teams.

```cpp
        if(n==0) return 0;
        if(n==1) return 0;
```
- **Base Case Checks**:
  - If `n` is `0`, the method returns `0`, indicating no matches can be played.
  - If `n` is `1`, the method also returns `0`, as a single team cannot compete.

```cpp
        int ans = n / 2;
```
- **Matches Calculation**: 
  - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n / 2`, representing the number of matches that can be played in the current round if `n` is even.

```cpp
        if(n & 1)
            ans += numberOfMatches(n/2 + 1);
        else
            ans += numberOfMatches(n/2);
```
- **Recursive Call**:
  - If `n` is odd (checked using the bitwise AND operation `n & 1`), we add the matches from the next round where `(n / 2 + 1)` teams advance.
  - If `n` is even, we add the matches from the next round where `(n / 2)` teams advance.

```cpp
        return ans;
    }
};
```
- **Return Statement**: Finally, the method returns the total number of matches played.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this recursive solution is \(O(\log n)\). Each call reduces the problem size roughly by half, resulting in logarithmic depth of recursion.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also \(O(\log n)\) due to the recursive call stack. 

### Conclusion

The recursive solution effectively computes the total number of matches in a knockout tournament, leveraging the properties of even and odd team counts. 

Key takeaways include:

1. **Efficient Match Counting**: The solution provides an elegant way to calculate matches without explicitly simulating each match, making it efficient for large values of `n`.

2. **Clear Recursive Logic**: The recursive approach is intuitive and clearly illustrates how matches are counted in rounds.

3. **Understanding of Knockout Tournaments**: This code encapsulates the fundamental mechanics of knockout tournaments, where teams are eliminated in each round, leading to a simple yet powerful mathematical model.

In summary, this code efficiently calculates the number of matches played in a knockout tournament through a recursive breakdown of team eliminations, providing a solid understanding of tournament dynamics and match counting.
