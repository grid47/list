### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of positive integers and an integer `k`, find the number of subarrays with exactly `k` distinct integers.

### Approach
1. **Key Insight**:
   - The solution involves using the sliding window approach with helper function `atmost`.
   - The number of subarrays with exactly `k` distinct integers can be derived from the difference:
     - `subarraysWithKDistinct(nums, k) = atmost(nums, k) - atmost(nums, k - 1)`.
     - This difference gives the count of subarrays with exactly `k` distinct integers.

2. **Helper Function `atmost`**:
   - Counts the number of subarrays with at most `k` distinct integers.
   - Uses a sliding window technique, extending the window to include new elements.
   - If the count of distinct integers in the window exceeds `k`, the window is shrunk from the left.
   - Adds to the result the number of subarrays ending at each index `i`.

3. **Window Adjustment**:
   - Expand the window by moving the right pointer and adjusting the count of distinct integers.
   - Shrink the window by moving the left pointer when the distinct count exceeds `k`.

### Code Walk-through
- The main function `subarraysWithKDistinct` calculates the exact count by leveraging the difference of subarray counts from `atmost`.
- `atmost` maintains the current window, tracking the number of occurrences of each integer, adjusting the window to ensure at most `k` distinct elements.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array, since each element is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), for the map storing the count of integers in the window.
