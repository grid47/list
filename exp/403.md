### Problem Statement
Given an array `stones` where `stones[i]` represents the position of the i-th stone on a straight line, determine if a frog can cross to the last stone. The frog starts at the first stone (position `0`) and can jump to a stone `k` positions ahead, where `k` can be one less, the same, or one more than the previous jump. The frog can only jump to stones that exist in the array.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: Create a map `mp` to store each stone's position as keys and the set of possible jump distances to that position as values. Start by inserting a jump of `1` to the first stone.
2. **Iterate through stones**: For each stone in the list:
   - For each possible jump from that stone, calculate the target position (`tgt`).
   - If the target position is the last stone, return `true`.
   - Insert possible jump distances (`step + 1`, `step`, `step - 1`) to the map for the target position, ensuring that the frog can make these jumps.
3. **Completion Check**: After processing all stones, if the last stone is not reachable, return `false`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Map Initialization**: The map `mp` is initialized with the starting position `0` having a jump of `1`.
2. **Outer Loop**: Iterate through each stone's position:
   - For each stone, access the set of possible jumps and calculate the target position for each jump.
   - If the target position matches the last stone, the frog can cross, so return `true`.
   - Insert new possible jumps for the target position into the map, considering one less, the same, and one more than the previous jump.
3. **Final Check**: If no valid path to the last stone is found after all iterations, return `false`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of stones. Each stone might be processed with each possible jump.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the map and the set of jump distances.
