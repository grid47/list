### Problem Statement
Determine if a given integer is a power of four.

### Approach
To check if a number is a power of four, we can use bitwise operations:

1. **Positive Check**: The number must be greater than zero.
2. **Power of Two Check**: The number must be a power of two. This can be determined using the condition \( (num \& (num - 1)) == 0 \), which checks if there is only one bit set in `num`.
3. **Power of Four Check**: For a number to be a power of four, if it is a power of two, then the position of the set bit must be even. This can be checked using \( (num - 1) \% 3 == 0 \).

### Code Walk-through
- The function first checks if `num` is greater than zero.
- It then verifies that `num` is a power of two by ensuring that only one bit is set.
- Finally, it checks that the number can be expressed as \( 4^k \) by ensuring that \( (num - 1) \) is divisible by 3.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(1) \) since we only perform a constant number of operations.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \) as no additional space is used.
