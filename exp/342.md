### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to determine if a given number `num` is a power of four. A number is a power of four if it can be expressed as `4^x` where `x` is a non-negative integer. In other words, we need to check if there exists a positive integer `x` such that `num == 4^x`.

#### Example:

- `16` is a power of four, as it can be expressed as `4^2`.
- `5` is **not** a power of four because there is no integer `x` such that `4^x == 5`.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can take advantage of some properties of binary numbers and modulo arithmetic:

1. **Power of Two Property**:
   - A number that is a power of four is also a power of two. This means that a number `num` which is a power of four will have exactly one `1` bit set in its binary representation.
   - In binary, powers of two look like `10000...0`, `100000...00`, and so on. We can check if `num` is a power of two using the condition `num & (num - 1) == 0`. This condition checks if `num` has only one `1` bit.

2. **Multiple of Three Property**:
   - A power of four, when subtracted by one, will always be a multiple of three. For example:
     - `4^1 = 4`, and `4 - 1 = 3` which is divisible by 3.
     - `4^2 = 16`, and `16 - 1 = 15` which is divisible by 3.
     - `4^3 = 64`, and `64 - 1 = 63` which is divisible by 3.
   - Hence, we can use the condition `(num - 1) % 3 == 0` to verify that `num` is a power of four.

By combining these conditions, we can determine if a number is a power of four efficiently.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Letâ€™s break down the code in detail:

```cpp
bool isPowerOfFour(int num) {
    return num > 0 && (num & (num - 1)) == 0 && (num - 1) % 3 == 0;
}
```

#### Step 1: Check if `num` is greater than zero:
```cpp
num > 0
```
- First, we check if `num` is positive. A power of four must be a positive integer. If `num` is non-positive, we return `false` immediately.

#### Step 2: Check if `num` is a power of two:
```cpp
(num & (num - 1)) == 0
```
- This condition checks if `num` has exactly one bit set in its binary representation.
- The expression `(num & (num - 1)) == 0` is a well-known bitwise trick for checking if a number is a power of two. It works because powers of two in binary always have only one `1` bit.
- For example, `16` (which is `10000` in binary) and `8` (which is `1000` in binary) will satisfy this condition because subtracting `1` from these numbers flips all the bits to the right of the highest `1` bit, leaving no common bits with the original number.

#### Step 3: Check if `num - 1` is divisible by 3:
```cpp
(num - 1) % 3 == 0
```
- This checks if the number `num - 1` is divisible by 3. As we discussed earlier, powers of four, when subtracted by one, are divisible by 3.
- This condition ensures that, not only is `num` a power of two, but it is specifically a power of four.

#### Final Return Value:
- The function will return `true` only if all three conditions are satisfied:
  - `num` is positive.
  - `num` is a power of two.
  - `num - 1` is divisible by 3.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The function performs a constant number of operations, regardless of the input size. All the checks (`num > 0`, `num & (num - 1) == 0`, and `(num - 1) % 3 == 0`) take constant time.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The function uses a constant amount of space. It only requires a small amount of space for the input and some temporary variables, all of which are independent of the size of `num`.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently determines if a number is a power of four using simple bitwise operations and modulo arithmetic. By leveraging the properties of binary numbers and powers of four, we can check the conditions in constant time and space, making the solution highly efficient.

#### Key Points:
- **Power of Two**: A power of four is always a power of two. We can check for this using bitwise operations.
- **Divisibility by Three**: The difference between a power of four and one is always divisible by 3, which gives us a second check to ensure the number is specifically a power of four.
- **Efficiency**: The solution runs in constant time and uses constant space, making it optimal for checking whether a number is a power of four.

This solution is ideal for scenarios where you need to check if numbers are powers of four in an efficient manner, especially in competitive programming or large-scale applications where performance is crucial.
