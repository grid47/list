### Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

### Approach
1. **Define Boundaries**:
   - Use four variables to define the boundaries of the spiral traversal:
     - `cBgn` (column beginning)
     - `cEnd` (column end)
     - `rBgn` (row beginning)
     - `rEnd` (row end)

2. **Iterate in Spiral Order**:
   - Use a `while` loop to continue traversing as long as the boundaries are valid (i.e., `cBgn <= cEnd` and `rBgn <= rEnd`).
   - Traverse the current top row from left to right.
   - Traverse the current right column from top to bottom.
   - If there are remaining rows, traverse the current bottom row from right to left.
   - If there are remaining columns, traverse the current left column from bottom to top.

### Code Walk-through
- **Initialization**:
   - Start with the initial boundaries set according to the matrix dimensions.
- **Traversal**:
   - For each layer of the spiral:
     - Add elements from the top row, right column, bottom row, and left column to the result vector `ans`.
     - Adjust the boundaries after each traversal to move inward.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(m \times n) \), where \( m \) is the number of rows and \( n \) is the number of columns in the matrix, since we visit each element once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(m \times n) \), for storing the result vector with all matrix elements.
