### Problem Statement

The problem is to return the elements of a given 2D matrix in a spiral order. The spiral order involves starting at the top-left corner of the matrix, moving right across the top row, down the rightmost column, left across the bottom row, and up the leftmost column. This process is repeated for the inner submatrix until all elements of the matrix are traversed.

For example, given the matrix:

```
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
```

The expected output in spiral order would be:

```
[1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
```

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, the solution uses a four-pointer approach to traverse the matrix in a spiral manner. The key idea is to maintain four boundaries:
- **`rBgn` (row beginning)**
- **`rEnd` (row end)**
- **`cBgn` (column beginning)**
- **`cEnd` (column end)**

These pointers track the current row and column limits, progressively shrinking towards the center of the matrix as the algorithm moves in a spiral direction. The traversal follows these four main steps:
1. Traverse from left to right across the topmost row.
2. Traverse from top to bottom down the rightmost column.
3. Traverse from right to left across the bottommost row.
4. Traverse from bottom to top up the leftmost column.

After completing each step, the corresponding boundary is updated, and the process continues until all elements are visited.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize Boundary Variables

```cpp
int cBgn = 0, cEnd = mtx[0].size()  - 1;
int rBgn = 0, rEnd = mtx.size() - 1;
```

- **`cBgn` (column beginning)** is set to 0, the first column.
- **`cEnd` (column end)** is set to `mtx[0].size() - 1`, which is the index of the last column.
- **`rBgn` (row beginning)** is set to 0, the first row.
- **`rEnd` (row end)** is set to `mtx.size() - 1`, which is the index of the last row.

These variables define the current boundaries of the matrix that need to be processed. The traversal will work by shrinking these boundaries after each pass.

#### Step 2: Initialize the Result Array

```cpp
vector<int> ans;
```

- **`ans`** is a vector that will store the elements of the matrix in spiral order. It starts as an empty vector.

#### Step 3: Loop Until All Elements Are Traversed

```cpp
while(cBgn <= cEnd && rBgn <= rEnd) {
```

- The loop continues as long as the column and row beginning pointers (`cBgn`, `rBgn`) do not surpass their respective ending pointers (`cEnd`, `rEnd`). This ensures that the algorithm processes the entire matrix and does not go out of bounds.

#### Step 4: Traverse from Left to Right across the Top Row

```cpp
for(int i = cBgn; i <= cEnd; i++)
    ans.push_back(mtx[rBgn][i]);
rBgn++;
```

- Traverse from `cBgn` to `cEnd` (the entire top row) and append each element to the `ans` vector.
- After processing the top row, increment `rBgn` to exclude this row in subsequent iterations.

#### Step 5: Traverse from Top to Bottom down the Right Column

```cpp
for(int i = rBgn; i <= rEnd; i++)
    ans.push_back(mtx[i][cEnd]);
cEnd--;
```

- Traverse from `rBgn` to `rEnd` (the entire right column) and append each element to the `ans` vector.
- After processing the right column, decrement `cEnd` to exclude this column in subsequent iterations.

#### Step 6: Traverse from Right to Left across the Bottom Row (If Valid)

```cpp
if(rBgn <= rEnd)
    for(int i = cEnd; i >= cBgn; i--)
        ans.push_back(mtx[rEnd][i]);
rEnd--;
```

- If `rBgn` is still less than or equal to `rEnd`, this means the bottom row has not yet been processed. Traverse from `cEnd` to `cBgn` (the entire bottom row) and append each element to the `ans` vector.
- After processing the bottom row, decrement `rEnd` to exclude it from subsequent iterations.

#### Step 7: Traverse from Bottom to Top up the Left Column (If Valid)

```cpp
if(cBgn <= cEnd)            
    for(int i = rEnd; i >= rBgn; i--)
        ans.push_back(mtx[i][cBgn]);
cBgn++;
```

- If `cBgn` is still less than or equal to `cEnd`, this means the left column has not yet been processed. Traverse from `rEnd` to `rBgn` (the entire left column) and append each element to the `ans` vector.
- After processing the left column, increment `cBgn` to exclude it from subsequent iterations.

#### Step 8: Return the Result

```cpp
return ans;
```

- After all the elements of the matrix are traversed, the `ans` vector contains the elements in spiral order. It is returned as the final result.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

- **O(n * m):** The algorithm visits each element of the matrix exactly once, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns. Since each element is processed once, the time complexity is linear with respect to the total number of elements in the matrix.

#### Space Complexity:

- **O(n * m):** The space complexity is primarily due to the storage of the result vector `ans`, which contains all the elements of the matrix. This requires O(n * m) space, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns.

### Conclusion

The provided solution solves the problem of returning the elements of a 2D matrix in spiral order using an efficient four-pointer approach. The matrix is traversed layer by layer, and the boundaries of each layer are updated after processing. This approach ensures that the solution runs in linear time, O(n * m), where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns, making it highly efficient even for large matrices.

This algorithm is ideal for handling large 2D matrices because it operates in a single pass through the matrix, without needing additional storage for tracking intermediate results, except for the output vector. The use of boundary pointers to navigate through the matrix makes the solution both simple and effective. This approach is widely used in problems involving spiral traversals or traversals of rectangular grids, making it a valuable technique for algorithmic problem-solving.
