### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, the task is to find all pairs of prime numbers `(p1, p2)` such that `p1 + p2 = n`, where `p1` and `p2` are prime numbers. The function should return a list of these prime pairs in any order.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we will use the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** method to find all prime numbers up to `n`. Then, we will iterate through the numbers and for each prime number `p1`, check if `n - p1` is also prime. If both `p1` and `n - p1` are prime numbers, we add the pair to the result list.

#### Steps:

1. **Generate all primes up to `n`**:
   - Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to mark all numbers up to `n` as prime or non-prime. This is done by iterating over numbers and marking their multiples as non-prime.
   
2. **Find prime pairs**:
   - After generating all prime numbers up to `n`, iterate through the numbers from 1 to `n / 2`. For each number `i`, check if both `i` and `n - i` are prime. If so, add the pair `(i, n - i)` to the result.

3. **Return the result**:
   - Return the list of prime pairs that sum to `n`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes Initialization**

```cpp
vector<int> net(n + 1, true);
net[1] = false;
```

- We create a vector `net` of size `n + 1` initialized to `true`. This array will represent whether a number is prime (`true`) or not (`false`).
- We initialize `net[1]` as `false` since `1` is not a prime number.

#### 2. **Marking Non-Primes Using Sieve**

```cpp
for(int i = 2; i < n / 2 + 1; i++)
    for(int j = 2; j * i < n; j++)
        net[j * i] = false;
```

- The outer loop starts from `i = 2` and runs up to `n / 2`. The reason we only go up to `n / 2` is because the larger multiples of `i` are already covered by smaller prime numbers.
- The inner loop marks all multiples of `i` as non-prime (`net[j * i] = false`). This is the core of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which eliminates non-prime numbers by marking their multiples.

#### 3. **Create the Result Vector**

```cpp
map<int, int> mp;
vector<vector<int>> res;
```

- A map `mp` is initialized but not used in this code. It seems unnecessary for this particular solution.
- `res` is the result vector, which will store all the prime pairs.

#### 4. **Iterate Through the Numbers and Check for Pairs**

```cpp
for(int i = 1; i < n / 2 + 1; i++)
    if(net[i] && net[n - i]) 
        res.push_back({i, n - i});
```

- We loop through numbers `i` from 1 to `n / 2`. The reason for stopping at `n / 2` is that we only need to check pairs where `p1 <= p2`. This ensures we avoid duplicate pairs like `(p1, p2)` and `(p2, p1)`.
- For each `i`, we check if both `i` and `n - i` are prime numbers (`net[i] && net[n - i]`).
- If both numbers are prime, we add the pair `{i, n - i}` to the result vector `res`.

#### 5. **Return the Result**

```cpp
return res;
```

- After the loop finishes, we return the list of prime pairs that sum up to `n`.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**:
   - The time complexity of the Sieve of Eratosthenes is \( O(n \log \log n) \). This is because we are marking multiples of each prime number starting from 2 up to `n / 2`, and the complexity of the sieve is dominated by the number of multiples marked for each prime number.
   
2. **Finding Prime Pairs**:
   - After calculating the sieve, we loop through all numbers from `1` to `n / 2`. For each number `i`, we check if both `i` and `n - i` are prime. This check takes constant time \( O(1) \) for each iteration. Therefore, this part has a time complexity of \( O(n) \).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(n \log \log n) \) due to the sieve.

#### Space Complexity

1. **Sieve Array**:
   - We use a vector `net` of size \( n + 1 \) to store whether each number from `1` to `n` is prime. The space complexity for this array is \( O(n) \).

2. **Result Vector**:
   - The result vector `res` will store pairs of prime numbers, and in the worst case, it will store approximately \( n / 2 \) pairs. Thus, the space complexity for the result vector is \( O(n) \).

Overall, the space complexity is \( O(n) \), as the largest space usage comes from the sieve array and the result vector.

### Conclusion

The solution efficiently finds all pairs of prime numbers that sum to a given number `n`. By using the Sieve of Eratosthenes to identify primes up to `n`, and then checking for prime pairs, this solution works in \( O(n \log \log n) \) time and \( O(n) \) space. The algorithm is well-suited for solving this problem even with relatively large values of `n`, and it guarantees that all prime pairs are found without duplication.
