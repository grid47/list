### Problem Statement

The task at hand is to calculate a number raised to a power represented by an array of digits, where each element of the array corresponds to a digit of the exponent. Specifically, you need to compute the value of `a^b % 1337`, where `a` is an integer and `b` is an array of digits representing the exponent. The array `b` can be very large, potentially exceeding typical data type limits.

The challenge is to compute this efficiently, considering the constraints, and ensuring that we handle extremely large numbers without directly manipulating them. 

### Approach

We are asked to compute the modular exponentiation of `a` raised to the large number represented by the array `b` efficiently. Since `b` is a list of digits, this is a classical problem involving **modular exponentiation** combined with **recursive power reduction**.

Key ideas in this problem include:

1. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since `1337` is a fixed modulus, we use the properties of modulo to simplify computations at each step. Specifically, we compute the modular exponentiation to avoid dealing with large numbers directly.
  
2. **Recursive Decomposition**: Instead of calculating `a^b` for large `b` directly, we break it down by recursively reducing the size of `b` one digit at a time. This exploits the property of numbers in base 10, which allows us to solve the problem efficiently by considering the last digit of the exponent and reducing the problem.

3. **Efficiency with Modular Exponentiation**: To compute `a^k % base` efficiently, we use a helper function `powmod` that uses **exponentiation by squaring** (also known as **fast exponentiation**), which is much faster than directly multiplying `a` by itself `k` times. This reduces the time complexity of the power calculation significantly.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

The solution can be broken down into the following components:

#### 1. `powmod` Function (Efficient Modular Exponentiation)

The `powmod` function computes `a^k % base`. Here's how it works:

```cpp
int powmod(int a, int k) {
    a %= base;  // Take a modulo base to avoid large numbers
    int res = 1;  // Start with result = 1 (multiplicative identity)
    for(int i = 0; i < k; i++) {  // Loop for k iterations
        res = (res * a) % base;  // Multiply the current result by a and take modulo
    }
    return res;  // Return the result
}
```

- **Line 1**: We reduce `a` modulo `base` to ensure that we donâ€™t handle large numbers unnecessarily.
- **Line 2**: Initialize `res` to 1, as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, and this is the identity for multiplication.
- **Lines 3-4**: We loop `k` times, multiplying the current result by `a` each time and taking the result modulo `base`.
- **Line 5**: Finally, we return `res`, which now holds `a^k % base`.

This function efficiently calculates modular exponentiation in a linear number of steps, and it handles large numbers by applying modulo at each step to prevent overflow.

#### 2. `superPow` Function (Recursive Decomposition)

The `superPow` function is where we break down the problem of computing `a^b % 1337`, where `b` is represented by an array of digits:

```cpp
int superPow(int a, vector<int>& b) {
    if(b.empty()) return 1;  // Base case: if b is empty, return 1 (any number to the power of 0 is 1)
    
    int last_digit = b.back();  // Get the last digit of b
    b.pop_back();  // Remove the last digit from b
    
    // Recursively calculate the result and reduce the problem
    return powmod(superPow(a, b), 10) * powmod(a, last_digit) % base;
}
```

- **Line 1**: If `b` is empty, we return `1`, since raising any number to the power of 0 is `1`. This is our base case for the recursion.
- **Line 2**: The last digit of the array `b` is extracted and stored in `last_digit`.
- **Line 3**: The last digit is removed from the array to reduce the problem size for the next recursive call.
- **Line 4**: We recursively calculate `superPow(a, b)` to compute the result of the smaller exponent, and then raise it to the power of 10 using `powmod`. This handles the powers of 10 efficiently.
- **Line 5**: We also compute `powmod(a, last_digit)` to handle the effect of the current digit on the exponent. We multiply the results of both these calculations and take the final result modulo `base` to get the correct value.

Thus, the function recursively reduces the problem by removing one digit from the exponent at a time, calculating smaller powers, and using the results to build up the final answer.

#### 3. Base Variable

```cpp
int base = 1337;
```

The base is set to `1337`, which is the modulus for the computation of `a^b % 1337`. This ensures that the final answer is computed modulo `1337`, which is crucial for handling large numbers.

### Example Walkthrough

Consider the example where `a = 2` and `b = [1, 0]`.

- First, the `superPow` function is called with `a = 2` and `b = [1, 0]`.
  - The last digit of `b` is `0`. We recursively call `superPow(a, b)` with `b = [1]`.
  
- Next, the `superPow` function is called with `a = 2` and `b = [1]`.
  - The last digit of `b` is `1`. We recursively call `superPow(a, b)` with an empty array `b = []`.
  
- The base case is reached, and `superPow(a, b)` returns `1`.
  
- Now, we compute `powmod(superPow(a, b), 10) = powmod(1, 10) = 1` and `powmod(a, last_digit) = powmod(2, 1) = 2`.

- The final result is `1 * 2 % 1337 = 2`.

Thus, `2^10 % 1337 = 2`.

### Time Complexity

- The `superPow` function is called recursively, reducing the size of `b` by one digit each time. If `n` is the number of digits in `b`, the recursion depth is `O(n)`.
- At each recursive step, we perform two `powmod` calls, each with a maximum exponent of `10`. The `powmod` function runs in `O(k)` time, where `k` is the exponent. Since the exponent is at most 10, the time complexity of `powmod` is constant (`O(1)`).
  
Therefore, the total time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of digits in `b`.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the recursion depth, where `n` is the number of digits in `b`.

### Conclusion

The `superPow` function efficiently computes the value of `a^b % 1337`, where `b` is represented by an array of digits, using recursive modular exponentiation. By breaking the problem into smaller subproblems and applying modulo operations at each step, this solution ensures that we can handle very large numbers without directly manipulating them. The time and space complexities are both linear in terms of the number of digits in the exponent, making this solution both efficient and scalable.
