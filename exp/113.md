### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree and a target sum, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values equals the target sum.

### Approach
1. Use a depth-first search (DFS) strategy to explore each path from the root to the leaves.
2. Maintain a current path and the remaining sum as you traverse the tree.
3. When a leaf node is reached, check if the current path's sum equals the target sum.
4. If it does, add the current path to the result list.

### Code Walk-through
- **`pathSum` function**:
  - **Line 5**: Initialize the result vector `paths` and the current `path`.
  - **Line 6**: Call the helper function `findPaths` to explore paths from the root.
  - **Line 7**: Return the collected paths.

- **`findPaths` function**:
  - **Line 10**: If the current node is `NULL`, return (base case).
  - **Line 12**: Add the current node's value to the `path`.
  - **Line 14**: Check if the current node is a leaf and if the remaining sum equals the node's value. If true, add the `path` to `paths`.
  - **Lines 16-17**: Recursively call `findPaths` for the left and right children, reducing the sum by the current node's value.
  - **Line 19**: Remove the current node from `path` to backtrack for the next exploration.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(H)\), where \(H\) is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack and the path storage.
