### Problem Statement
You are given an array of binary strings `strs` and two integers `zeros` and `ones`. Your task is to find the maximum number of strings that can be formed such that the number of `0`s in the selected strings does not exceed `zeros` and the number of `1`s does not exceed `ones`.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**:
   - Create a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of binary strings that can be formed using `i` `0`s and `j` `1`s.
   - The table dimensions are `(zeros + 1) x (ones + 1)`.

2. **Counting Zeros and Ones**:
   - For each string `s` in `strs`, calculate the count of `0`s and `1`s:
     - `currZero`: Number of `0`s in the string.
     - `currOne`: Number of `1`s in the string.

3. **DP State Transition**:
   - Iterate through the DP table in reverse order to avoid overwriting results that are needed in the same iteration:
     - For each string, update the DP table based on the current counts of `0`s and `1`s.
     - The transition is defined as:
       ```cpp
       dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i - currZero][j - currOne]);
       ```

4. **Result**:
   - The value at `dp[zeros][ones]` will give the maximum number of binary strings that can be formed under the given constraints.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `findMaxForm()` takes the vector of strings and two integers as inputs.

2. **Counting and Updating DP Table**:
   - For each string, it counts `0`s and `1`s and updates the DP table accordingly.

3. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum number of strings that can be formed.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * Z * O), where `N` is the number of strings, `Z` is the maximum number of `0`s, and `O` is the maximum number of `1`s.
- **Space Complexity**: O(Z * O), as the DP table size depends on the number of `0`s and `1`s.
