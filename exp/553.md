### Problem Statement
Given a list of integers `nums`, the goal is to return a string that represents the optimal way to divide these numbers. The optimal division should minimize the overall result of the division operation. 

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Division**:
   - For a single number, just return that number.
   - For two numbers, return them in the format "a/b".
   - For more than two numbers, the optimal way to perform the division is to place the first number in the numerator and all subsequent numbers in the denominator, enclosed in parentheses.

2. **Constructing the Result String**:
   - If the size of `nums` is 1, return the number as a string.
   - If the size of `nums` is 2, return them as "a/b".
   - For more than two numbers:
     - Start with the first number followed by a slash.
     - Append the remaining numbers in parentheses, separated by slashes.

### Code Walk-through
- The function `optimalDivision` constructs the output string based on the size of the input list `nums`.
- It handles the edge cases of 1 and 2 elements separately.
- For lists with more than 2 elements, it uses a loop to concatenate the numbers appropriately, ensuring the last character is a closing parenthesis.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`, since each number is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the resulting string that is built based on the input numbers.
