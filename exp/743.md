### Problem Statement
You are given a directed graph represented as an array of edges `times`, where each edge is a triplet `(u, v, w)` indicating that there is a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` with a weight (or time delay) of `w`. The goal is to determine the time it takes for a signal sent from a starting node `k` to reach all `n` nodes in the network.

### Approach
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use a map of maps (adjacency list) to represent the directed graph. The outer map represents the source node, and the inner map contains destination nodes with their corresponding weights.

2. **Priority Queue**:
   - Use a min-heap (priority queue) to process nodes based on the current known minimum time to reach each node.
   - The queue stores pairs of the form `(current time, node)`.

3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
   - Initialize the priority queue with the starting node `k` and a time of `0`.
   - Maintain a visited array to track which nodes have been processed.
   - While the priority queue is not empty:
     - Pop the node with the smallest time.
     - If the node has already been visited, skip it.
     - Mark the node as visited and decrement the remaining nodes to visit.
     - If all nodes are visited, return the current time.
     - For each neighboring node, push the updated time into the priority queue.

4. **Return Result**:
   - If not all nodes are reachable, return `-1`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of nodes. The logarithmic factor comes from the priority queue operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for storing the graph and the priority queue.

### Example
For `times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]]`, `n = 4`, and `k = 2`:
- Start from node `2`:
  - Signal reaches `1` in `1` time unit.
  - Signal reaches `3` in `1` time unit.
  - Signal reaches `4` in `2` time units (from `3`).
- Total time for all nodes to receive the signal is `2`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the main method for processing the graph.

- **Method**:
  - `int networkDelayTime(vector<vector<int>>& times, int n, int k)`: Implements the Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the maximum delay for the signal to reach all nodes.
