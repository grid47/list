### Problem Statement

Given an integer `num`, the task is to compute the maximum and minimum possible values by modifying digits in `num` as follows:

1. Replace some or all of the occurrences of a particular digit with the digit `0` to get the minimum value.
2. Replace some or all of the occurrences of a particular digit with the digit `9` to get the maximum value.

Return the difference between the maximum and minimum values obtained by these transformations.

### Approach

1. **Initialize Min and Max Values**: Begin by setting `min_v` and `max_v` to `num`. These will store the minimum and maximum values generated by modifying `num`.

2. **Iterate Through Each Digit**: 
   - Iterate over each digit from `0` to `9`. For each digit, calculate the modified versions of `num` by replacing occurrences of that digit with `0` (for minimum value) and `9` (for maximum value).
   
3. **Generate Modified Values**:
   - For each digit `i`, decompose `num` by separating each digit in reverse order. This allows us to inspect each position of `num` individually.
   - For each position, decide if the digit matches `i`. If so, replace it with `0` (for minimum calculation) or `9` (for maximum calculation). If it does not match, keep the digit as it is.
   
4. **Calculate the Minimum and Maximum Versions**:
   - Use two variables, `lo` (for minimum) and `hi` (for maximum), to build the modified numbers.
   - Multiply each digit by the current positional multiplier (`mul`, starting at `1` and increasing by a factor of `10` with each position).
   - As you proceed, add the modified digits to `lo` and `hi` respectively.

5. **Update Global Minimum and Maximum**:
   - After each iteration over `i`, update `min_v` with the minimum value of `min_v` and `lo`, and `max_v` with the maximum value of `max_v` and `hi`.
   - This ensures that `min_v` holds the smallest possible value and `max_v` holds the largest possible value across all digit transformations.

6. **Return the Difference**: Finally, return the difference `max_v - min_v`, which represents the maximum possible range of values achievable by digit replacements in `num`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   ```cpp
   int min_v = num, max_v = num;
   ```
   `min_v` and `max_v` are initialized to `num` to hold the smallest and largest possible values.

2. **Loop Through Each Digit**:
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { ... }
   ```
   Loop through digits `0` to `9`. For each digit, calculate potential minimum and maximum versions by replacing occurrences of this digit.

3. **Initialize Variables for Modified Values**:
   ```cpp
   int lo = 0, hi = 0, mul = 1;
   ```
   `lo` and `hi` store the minimum and maximum modified values of `num` by replacing occurrences of `i`. `mul` keeps track of positional value, starting at `1` for the least significant digit and increasing by `10` times per position.

4. **Extract and Replace Digits**:
   ```cpp
   for (int n = num; n; n /= 10) {
       bool replace = n % 10 == i;
       lo += (replace ? 0 : n % 10) * mul;
       hi += (replace ? 9 : n % 10) * mul;
       mul *= 10;
   }
   ```
   - For each digit in `num` (processed from right to left), check if it matches `i`.
   - If `replace` is true, replace with `0` in `lo` and `9` in `hi`. Otherwise, keep the original digit.
   - Update `mul` by a factor of `10` after processing each digit.

5. **Update `min_v` and `max_v`**:
   ```cpp
   min_v = min(min_v, lo);
   max_v = max(max_v, hi);
   ```
   After calculating `lo` and `hi` for the current digit `i`, update `min_v` and `max_v` with the minimum and maximum values found so far.

6. **Return the Difference**:
   ```cpp
   return max_v - min_v;
   ```
   The result is the difference between the largest and smallest possible values of `num`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The outer loop iterates over 10 digits (`0` through `9`).
  - The inner loop iterates over each digit of `num` (up to \(O(\log_{10} N)\) iterations, where \(N\) is the value of `num`).
  - Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(10 \cdot \log_{10} N)\), which is efficient for typical input sizes.

- **Space Complexity**: 
  - The algorithm uses \(O(1)\) additional space for storing integers (`min_v`, `max_v`, `lo`, `hi`, and `mul`), so the space complexity is \(O(1)\).

### Conclusion

This solution effectively maximizes and minimizes `num` by selectively replacing digits with `0` or `9`, allowing us to compute the widest possible range from minimum to maximum values. By iterating through each digit, we ensure that the solution is both efficient and comprehensive in finding the optimal transformations.
