### Problem Statement
Given an array of strings `strs`, each of the same length, you need to determine the minimum number of columns that can be deleted so that each row (string) is sorted in lexicographical order.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
   - Use a DP array `memo` to store the maximum number of rows that can be sorted for each column index and the index of the previous column that was included in the sorting.
   - Use another array `cmem` to cache the results of the column validity check to avoid redundant computations.

2. **Column Validity Check**:
   - Implement a `check` function to determine if the characters in the current column (`idx`) are less than the characters in the previous column (`prv`) for all strings.
   - If any string fails this condition, the function returns false.

3. **Recursion with Memoization**:
   - Define a recursive `dp` function that takes the current column index and the previous column index as parameters.
   - Base Case: If `idx` is equal to the length of the strings, return 0 (no more columns to process).
   - If the result for the current state is already computed, return it from `memo`.
   - Recur for the next column without including the current column and store the result.
   - If including the current column is valid (checked by `check`), also recur by including it and update the result.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Subtract the result of the DP function from the total number of columns to get the minimum number of deletions required.

### Code Walk-through
1. **`minDeletionSize` Method**:
   - Initializes the `strs` member variable and sets the `memo` and `cmem` arrays to `-1`.
   - Calls the `dp` function starting from the first column (`idx = 0`) with `prv = -1` (no previous column).
   - Returns the number of columns minus the maximum number of sorted rows returned by the DP function.

2. **`dp` Method**:
   - Checks if all columns are processed and returns 0 if so.
   - Returns the cached result if already computed.
   - Calculates the maximum of not including the current column or including it if valid, using the results from recursive calls.

3. **`check` Method**:
   - Validates the characters in the current column against the previous column for all strings.
   - Caches the result to avoid recomputation.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * M^2), where N is the number of strings and M is the length of each string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N * M) for the memoization arrays.
