### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` which consists of lowercase letters and digits. Each digit `d` indicates that the preceding substring should be repeated `d` times. The task is to find the `k`-th character of the decoded string. The decoded string can be very large, so you need to determine the character without explicitly constructing the full string.

### Approach
The solution involves two main steps:

1. **Calculate the Length of the Decoded String**:
   - Iterate through the string and compute the effective length of the decoded string `N` until it reaches or exceeds `k`.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If it's a digit, multiply `N` by the digit (the repeat factor).
     - If it's a letter, increment `N` by 1.

2. **Backtrack to Find the k-th Character**:
   - Start from the end of the string and backtrack to find the `k`-th character:
     - If the character is a digit, divide `N` by the digit and update `k` to find its position in the expanded string.
     - If the character is a letter, check if the current position corresponds to `k`. If so, return that character.

### Code Walk-through
- The function `decodeAtIndex` begins by calculating the total length of the decoded string.
- After determining the total length, it backtracks through the string to find the exact character at position `k`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string `s`, since we make a single pass through the string.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
