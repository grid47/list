### Problem Statement
Merge `k` sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list and return it.

### Approach
1. **Use a Min-Heap (Priority Queue)**: Utilize a min-heap to efficiently retrieve the smallest node among the k lists.
2. **Initialization**:
   - Define a custom comparator `cmp` for the priority queue to order nodes based on their values.
   - Initialize the priority queue with the head nodes of all non-empty linked lists.
3. **Merging Process**:
   - Create a dummy head node to facilitate the construction of the merged list.
   - While the priority queue is not empty:
     - Extract the smallest node (top of the min-heap).
     - Add this node to the merged list.
     - If the extracted node has a next node, push it onto the priority queue.
4. **Return the Merged List**: The merged list starts from the next node of the dummy head.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Custom Comparator**: Define a `cmp` class that overrides the `operator()` to compare `ListNode` values.
2. **Function Definition**: The `mergeKLists` function initializes the min-heap and processes the nodes.
3. **Node Processing**:
   - Push all initial nodes into the priority queue.
   - Continuously pop the smallest node, attach it to the merged list, and push its next node until all nodes are processed.
4. **Final Output**: Return the head of the merged linked list.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N \log k)\), where \(N\) is the total number of nodes across all lists, and \(k\) is the number of linked lists.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(k)\) for the priority queue storing at most `k` nodes at any given time.
