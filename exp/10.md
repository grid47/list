### 🧠 **Regular Expression Matching**

The problem asks us to implement a function that matches a string `s` against a pattern `p`, where the pattern can contain:
- **`.`**: Matches any single character.
- **`*`**: Matches zero or more of the preceding character.

Your goal is to determine if the string `s` matches the pattern `p`.

### 📌 **Example**

- **Input**: `isMatch("aa", "a*")`  
  **Output**: `true`  
  (Explanation: `a*` matches "aa".)

- **Input**: `isMatch("mississippi", "mis*is*p*.")`  
  **Output**: `false`  
  (Explanation: The pattern does not match the string.)

### 🛠️ **Approach: Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**

We will use **Dynamic Programming (DP)** to solve the problem efficiently by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. Here’s the approach:

1. **Recursive Matching**:
   - Start by comparing characters of `s` and `p` from the beginning.
   - If the current pattern character is `*`, it can either match zero occurrences or multiple occurrences of the preceding character.
   - If the current pattern character is `.`, it matches any single character in `s`.

2. **Memoization**:
   - Use a 2D table `memo[i][j]` to store the result of matching the substring `s[i:]` with the pattern `p[j:]`. This avoids recomputation and optimizes the solution.

---

### 💻 **Code Breakdown (Step-by-Step)**

#### Step 1: Main Function to Start Matching

```cpp
bool isMatch(string s, string p) {
    this->s = s;
    this->p = p;
    memo.resize(s.size() + 1, vector<int>(p.size() + 1, -1));
    return dp(0, 0);
}
```

- Initialize the `memo` table, which has dimensions `(s.size() + 1) x (p.size() + 1)` to store intermediate results.
- The `dp(0, 0)` call starts the recursive matching from the beginning of both the string `s` and the pattern `p`.

#### Step 2: Dynamic Programming Helper Function

```cpp
bool dp(int i, int j) {
    if (i == s.size() && j == p.size()) return true; // Both string and pattern are exhausted
    if (j == p.size()) return false; // Pattern is exhausted, but string isn't
```

- **Base Case 1**: If both the string `s` and the pattern `p` have been fully traversed, return `true` because we’ve matched the entire string.
- **Base Case 2**: If the pattern is exhausted but the string isn’t, return `false`.

#### Step 3: Check if Result is Already Computed

```cpp
    if (memo[i][j] != -1) return memo[i][j]; // Return the cached result if already computed
```

- If the result for this subproblem (`i`, `j`) is already computed, simply return the stored result to save time.

#### Step 4: Matching Logic for `*` and `.`

```cpp
    int ans = 0; // Variable to store the result for this subproblem
    
    if (j + 1 < p.size() && p[j + 1] == '*') {
        if (i < s.size() && (s[i] == p[j] || p[j] == '.'))
            ans |= dp(i + 1, j); // Match one or more of the preceding character
        
        ans |= dp(i, j + 2); // Match zero occurrences of the preceding character
    } else {
        if (i < s.size() && (s[i] == p[j] || p[j] == '.'))
            ans |= dp(i + 1, j + 1); // Match the current character
    }
```

- **When the next pattern character is `*`**:
  - **Match zero occurrences**: Skip the current pattern character and its preceding one (`dp(i, j + 2)`).
  - **Match one or more occurrences**: If the current character in the string matches the current pattern (or it's a dot), move to the next character in the string (`dp(i + 1, j)`).
  
- **When the next pattern character is not `*`**:
  - Simply check if the current characters in the string and pattern match, or if the pattern character is a dot (`.`), which matches any character.

#### Step 5: Store the Result

```cpp
    return memo[i][j] = ans; // Store the result for this subproblem
}
```

- After evaluating all matching conditions for the current pair `(i, j)`, store the result in `memo[i][j]` to avoid redundant calculations.

### 📈 **Complexity Analysis**

#### Time Complexity: **O(m * n)**
- The time complexity is proportional to the product of the lengths of `s` and `p` because we only explore each pair of indices `(i, j)` once, where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `p`.

#### Space Complexity: **O(m * n)**
- The space complexity is dominated by the size of the `memo` table, which is `(m + 1) x (n + 1)`.

---

### 🚀 **Conclusion**

This solution efficiently checks if a string matches a pattern with `.` and `*` using dynamic programming with memoization:

- **Handling Special Characters**: The `*` and `.` are handled carefully to match multiple occurrences (`*`) or any single character (`.`).
- **Efficiency**: By using memoization, we avoid recomputing the same subproblems, improving the performance. The solution runs in **O(m * n)** time, making it efficient for larger inputs.

By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and reusing previously computed results, we ensure an optimal solution that is both time-efficient and easy to understand.
