### Problem Statement
Implement a regular expression matching function that supports `.` and `*` characters. The `.` character matches any single character, while the `*` character matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.

### Approach
Use dynamic programming to memoize results of subproblems, allowing the algorithm to efficiently explore possible matches between the string `s` and the pattern `p`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Store the input strings `s` and `p` as member variables.
   - Create a `memo` table initialized to -1, which will store the results of previously computed subproblems.

2. **Recursive Function `dp`**:
   - **Base Cases**:
     - If both `i` (index for `s`) and `j` (index for `p`) reach the end of their respective strings, return `true`.
     - If `j` reaches the end of `p` but `i` has not reached the end of `s`, return `false`.
   - **Memoization Check**:
     - If the result for the current indices `i` and `j` has been computed, return the stored result from `memo`.

3. **Matching Logic**:
   - If the next character in `p` is `*`:
     - Check if the current characters in `s` and `p` match, or if `p[j]` is `.`. If they match, recursively check for the next character in `s` while keeping `j` fixed or skip the `*` and its preceding character in `p` by advancing `j` by 2.
   - If the next character is not `*`:
     - Check if the current characters in `s` and `p` match, or if `p[j]` is `.`. If they match, recursively check for the next characters in both strings.

4. **Store Result**:
   - Store the result of the current subproblem in `memo` before returning.

5. **Wrapper Function `isMatch`**:
   - This function initializes the `memo` table and starts the recursive matching process from the beginning of both strings.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m \times n)\) - where \(m\) is the length of `s` and \(n\) is the length of `p`, as each subproblem is computed once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(m \times n)\) - for the `memo` table.
