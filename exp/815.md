### Problem Statement

Given a series of bus routes, each represented as a list of bus stops, we need to find the minimum number of buses required to travel from a specified starting bus stop (`source`) to a destination bus stop (`target`). Each bus route operates as a circular route, meaning that if a bus route covers stops `[A, B, C]`, it continuously loops through these stops. We need an efficient way to determine the shortest path using the fewest bus transfers from the source to the target stop.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we treat each bus as a node and establish connections (edges) between buses that share any common stops. This problem then reduces to a graph traversal problem where nodes represent buses, and edges between nodes represent direct transfer opportunities between buses. A breadth-first search (BFS) is ideal here because it efficiently finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here’s the step-by-step approach:

1. **Mapping Bus Stops to Routes**:
   - For each stop in a bus route, store the bus route index in a hashmap. This helps quickly identify which buses visit a given stop, creating a route map.

2. **Building the Bus Graph**:
   - For each bus route, identify other routes that share any stops. These routes are directly connected, allowing passengers to transfer between them without changing bus stops.

3. **Initializing BFS**:
   - If the source and target are the same, return `0` as no buses are needed.
   - Otherwise, initialize a BFS starting with the buses that pass through the source stop. Track visited buses to avoid revisiting nodes and cycles.

4. **Perform BFS to Find Minimum Transfers**:
   - Process each bus route level by level. For each bus, check if it reaches the target stop. If so, return the current number of transfers.
   - If not, enqueue all directly connected buses that haven’t been visited, representing a transfer to those routes.

5. **Return Result**:
   - If BFS completes without reaching the target stop, return `-1` as the target stop is unreachable.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables and Create Mapping

```cpp
unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> mp;
int n = routes.size();
vector<vector<int>> bus(n);
```

- `mp` maps each stop to the set of buses that pass through it.
- `bus` is a graph where each index represents a bus and stores connections to other buses that share stops.

#### Step 2: Populate Bus Connections

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for(int x: routes[i]) {
        if(!mp[x].count(i)) {
            for(auto it: mp[x]) {
                bus[i].push_back(it);
                bus[it].push_back(i);
            }
        }
        mp[x].insert(i);
    }
}
```

- For each stop in each bus route, check if it’s already been processed for that bus. If not, add mutual connections in `bus` between any buses that share this stop.
- Update `mp` to mark that this bus route serves this stop.

#### Step 3: Check for Trivial Case and Start BFS

```cpp
if(source == target) return 0;
int cnt = 0;
queue<int> q;
set<int> vis;
for(int it: mp[source]) {
    q.push(it);
    vis.insert(it);
}
```

- If the `source` and `target` stops are the same, return `0`.
- Initialize BFS by pushing all buses that pass through the `source` stop to the queue and mark them as visited.

#### Step 4: Perform BFS to Find Minimum Bus Transfers

```cpp
while(!q.empty()) {
    cnt++;
    int sz = q.size();
    while(sz--) {
        int x = q.front();
        q.pop();
        if(mp[target].count(x)) return cnt;
        for(auto it: bus[x]) {
            if(vis.count(it)) continue;
            vis.insert(it);
            q.push(it);
        }
    }
}
```

- Each level of BFS represents a transfer to another bus.
- For each bus in the current level, check if it reaches `target` (indicating a valid route), then return `cnt`.
- Enqueue unvisited, directly connected buses, marking them visited to prevent cycles.

#### Step 5: Return Result if Target is Unreachable

```cpp
return -1;
```

- If the BFS completes without finding the `target`, return `-1`, meaning the destination is unreachable.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity
- Constructing `mp` and `bus` is **O(N * M)**, where `N` is the number of bus routes and `M` is the average number of stops per route.
- BFS traverses each bus and its connections at most once, making it **O(N)** in the worst case.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is **O(N + M)** for storing the graph `bus` and the mapping `mp`.

### Conclusion

This solution optimally solves the problem by modeling it as a graph traversal with nodes as buses and edges as direct connections between buses sharing stops. Using BFS allows for an efficient search for the minimum number of transfers needed to reach the target, while the hashmap ensures quick lookup of bus connections. This approach is ideal for large datasets with potentially complex networks of routes, ensuring quick and accurate results.
