### Problem Statement
You are given a list of bus routes and two bus stops: a source and a target. Each bus route is represented as an array of bus stops it serves. Your task is to find the minimum number of buses required to travel from the source to the target. If it is not possible to reach the target, return -1.

### Approach
This problem can be approached using a graph traversal technique (Breadth-First Search, BFS) because we can consider each bus route as a node and each bus stop as an edge connecting those nodes.

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use an unordered map (`mp`) to keep track of which bus routes serve each bus stop.
   - Use an adjacency list (`bus`) to represent the connections between bus routes.

2. **Building the Graph**:
   - Iterate through each route and populate the map so that each bus stop points to the routes that can be taken from that stop.
   - Populate the adjacency list to show which routes are connected to each other.

3. **BFS Initialization**:
   - If the source and target are the same, return 0 (no buses needed).
   - Initialize a queue for BFS and a set to keep track of visited bus routes.

4. **BFS Traversal**:
   - For each level of BFS (each bus transfer), push all the bus routes accessible from the currently visited routes into the queue.
   - Check if any of these routes lead to the target bus stop. If so, return the current count of buses taken.
   - If the queue is exhausted without reaching the target, return -1.

### Code Walk-through
- The `numBusesToDestination` function constructs the necessary data structures and performs BFS.
- The graph is built to show connections between bus routes.
- The BFS process explores each level of routes, counting the number of transfers (buses).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(B + S), where B is the number of bus routes and S is the number of bus stops. Each bus route and stop is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(B + S) for storing the graph representation and the queue.

This approach effectively finds the minimum number of buses needed to travel from the source to the target while handling edge cases where the target may not be reachable.
