### Problem Statement
Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:
1. **Add a number**: `addNum(int num)` - Adds a integer number from the data stream.
2. **Find the median**: `findMedian()` - Returns the median of all elements so far.

### Approach
The solution uses two heaps to maintain a balanced distribution of numbers, enabling efficient median retrieval:

1. **Two Heaps**:
   - A **max-heap** (`sm`) to store the smaller half of the numbers.
   - A **min-heap** (`lg`) to store the larger half of the numbers.

2. **Adding a Number**:
   - When a new number is added, push it into the max-heap (`sm`).
   - The maximum value of the max-heap is then moved to the min-heap (`lg`) to maintain the order.
   - If the size of the max-heap becomes smaller than the size of the min-heap, the smallest value from the min-heap is pushed back into the max-heap to keep the heaps balanced.

3. **Finding the Median**:
   - If the max-heap has more elements, the median is the top of the max-heap.
   - If both heaps are of equal size, the median is the average of the tops of both heaps.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: Integer `num` for `addNum` and a call to `findMedian()`.
- **Output**: The median value as a double.

1. Initialize two priority queues (heaps): one max-heap and one min-heap.
2. In `addNum(int num)`:
   - Push the number into the max-heap.
   - Move the top of the max-heap to the min-heap.
   - If necessary, rebalance the heaps by moving elements between them.
3. In `findMedian()`:
   - Check the sizes of the heaps and return the appropriate median value.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - `O(log n)` for `addNum(int num)` due to heap operations.
  - `O(1)` for `findMedian()` since it only accesses the top elements of the heaps.
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - \(O(n)\) for storing the elements in the heaps.
