### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, the task is to find all duplicate subtrees in the tree. A duplicate subtree is defined as one that appears more than once in the tree, and each subtree is defined by its root node and its structure.

### Approach
1. **Serialization of Subtrees**:
   - Use a helper function to serialize each subtree in a standardized string format. This string representation allows for easy identification of duplicate structures.
   - The serialization format includes the subtree's value and its left and right child representations enclosed in parentheses.

2. **Storage of Subtree References**:
   - Utilize an unordered map (or dictionary) to store serialized strings as keys and their corresponding subtree nodes as values (in a vector). This helps in tracking how many times each subtree structure appears.

3. **Identification of Duplicates**:
   - After serializing all subtrees, iterate through the map to find those entries that have more than one subtree associated with them. These represent the duplicate subtrees.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Data Structure Initialization**:
   - Define a map to store serialized strings and their corresponding TreeNode pointers.

2. **Recursive Serialization**:
   - Implement a recursive function that constructs the serialized string for each subtree, storing it in the map and associating it with the root node of that subtree.

3. **Final Result Construction**:
   - After serialization is complete, gather all unique subtree roots that appear more than once and return them as the final result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed exactly once during serialization.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for the storage of serialized strings and references to the duplicate subtree roots in the map.
