### Problem Statement
Given two strings, `s` and `goal`, determine if you can swap exactly one pair of letters in `s` to make it equal to `goal`. The strings must be of the same length.

### Approach
1. **Length Check**: First, check if the lengths of the two strings are different. If they are, return `false` immediately since swapping characters will not resolve length discrepancies.

2. **Count Mismatches**: Iterate through the characters of both strings, counting how many characters differ between `s` and `goal`. Track the indices of the first two mismatched characters.

3. **Handle Cases**:
   - If there are no mismatches (`cnt == 0`), check if there is at least one character that appears twice in `s` (indicating a swap can be made with itself).
   - If there are exactly two mismatches (`cnt == 2`), verify that swapping the mismatched characters can produce `goal`.

4. **Return Result**: Based on the conditions checked above, return `true` or `false`.

### Code Walk-through
- Use a bitwise operation to track the presence of characters in `s` for quick lookup.
- The final checks ensure that the characters can be swapped appropriately.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the strings (since we iterate through the strings once).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we use a constant amount of space for counters and flags.
