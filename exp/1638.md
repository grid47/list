### Problem Statement

The problem requires counting the number of substrings in two given strings, \(s\) and \(t\), such that the two substrings differ by exactly one character. A substring is defined as a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. This problem tests the understanding of substring manipulation and string comparison in programming.

### Approach

The solution utilizes a two-part approach to efficiently count the required substrings:

1. **Counting from the Start of `s`**: For each starting index in the string \(s\), we call a helper function to count how many substrings that start from that index in \(s\) can match with any starting index in \(t\) while differing by exactly one character.

2. **Counting from the Start of `t`**: Similarly, we count substrings starting from each index in \(t\) that can match with any starting index in \(s\).

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's analyze the provided code to understand how it achieves the desired functionality.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countSubstrings(string s, string t) {
```
- The `countSubstrings` function begins the process by defining the input strings \(s\) and \(t\). This function will ultimately return the count of valid substrings differing by one character.

```cpp
        int res = 0;
```
- We initialize a variable `res` to accumulate the total count of substrings found.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++)
            res += helper(s, t, i, 0);
```
- This loop iterates through each index of the string \(s\). For each index \(i\), the helper function is invoked, starting at \(i\) in \(s\) and at index \(0\) in \(t\). The returned count from the helper function is added to `res`.

```cpp
        for(int j = 1; j < t.size(); j++)
            res += helper(s, t, 0, j);
```
- This loop iterates through each index of the string \(t\) starting from index \(1\). For each index \(j\), the helper function is called, starting at index \(0\) in \(s\) and at \(j\) in \(t\). The count returned from this function call is also added to `res`.

```cpp
        return res;
    }
```
- Finally, the total count `res` is returned.

#### Helper Function Explanation

```cpp
    int helper(string s, string t, int i, int j) {
        int res = 0, pre = 0, cur = 0;
```
- The `helper` function is defined to compare substrings starting at indices \(i\) in \(s\) and \(j\) in \(t\). Three variables are initialized:
  - `res`: to hold the count of valid substrings found.
  - `pre`: to track the length of matching substrings before the last mismatch.
  - `cur`: to track the current length of the substring being analyzed.

```cpp
        for(int n = s.size(), m = t.size(); i < n && j < m; i++, j++) {
```
- A loop is initiated that continues as long as indices \(i\) and \(j\) are within the bounds of \(s\) and \(t\) respectively.

```cpp
            cur++;
```
- For every iteration, `cur` is incremented as the current substring is being extended.

```cpp
            if(s[i] != t[j]) {
                pre = cur;
                cur = 0;
            }
```
- If the characters at the current indices of \(s\) and \(t\) do not match, the following actions occur:
  - `pre` is updated to the current length of the substring, representing the last known sequence of matches.
  - `cur` is reset to `0` since a mismatch has occurred.

```cpp
            res += pre;
```
- The variable `res` is updated by adding `pre`. This accounts for all valid substrings found up to the current mismatch that differ by exactly one character.

```cpp
        return res;
    }
```
- Finally, the function returns the total count of valid substrings found.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \times m)\), where \(n\) is the length of string \(s\) and \(m\) is the length of string \(t\). Each helper function call can take up to \(O(n + m)\) time in the worst case, and there are \(n + m\) such calls.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since no additional space proportional to the input size is utilized; we are only using a fixed number of variables for counting.

### Conclusion

The `countSubstrings` function effectively counts the number of substrings from two strings that differ by exactly one character by leveraging the helper function to analyze potential substring matches efficiently.

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **Two-Dimensional Comparison**: The approach of checking substrings starting from different positions in both strings ensures that we capture all valid cases of differing substrings.
2. **Utilizing Helper Functions**: The use of a helper function to encapsulate the logic for counting valid substrings simplifies the main function and promotes code reuse.
3. **Efficient Counting Strategy**: The counting mechanism utilizes prefix tracking to avoid unnecessary recalculations, making the substring comparison efficient.

This solution serves as a great example of using structured iteration and conditional checks to derive counts from complex string operations in an optimal manner.
