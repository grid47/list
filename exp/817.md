### Problem Statement
Given a linked list and a list of integers (`nums`), the task is to count the number of connected components in the linked list, where a component is defined as a maximal sublist of the linked list where each node's value is present in `nums`.

### Approach
1. **Use a Set for Fast Lookup**:
   - Convert the vector `nums` into an unordered set for O(1) average time complexity for lookups. This will help to quickly check if a node's value is part of the components we are interested in.

2. **Traverse the Linked List**:
   - Initialize a counter `res` to keep track of the number of components.
   - Iterate through each node in the linked list:
     - Check if the current node's value exists in the set.
     - Additionally, check if the next node is either `NULL` or not in the set. If both conditions are true, it indicates the end of a connected component, so increment the counter.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After traversing the entire list, return the counter as the result.

### Code Walk-through
- The `numComponents` function initializes a set from `nums` and then iterates through the linked list to count the components.
- It uses a single loop to traverse the linked list, making it efficient.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list, since we visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(M), where M is the number of unique elements in `nums`, due to the storage of these elements in the set.

This solution is efficient and clearly counts the connected components in the linked list based on the given criteria.
