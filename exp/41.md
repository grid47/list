### Problem Statement
The goal is to find the smallest missing positive integer from a given integer array. The array can contain duplicates, negative numbers, and zero.

### Approach
1. **In-place Rearrangement**: The solution rearranges the numbers in the array so that each number `x` is placed at the index `x-1` if `x` is a positive integer and within the bounds of the array size.
2. **Two-pass Solution**:
   - **First Pass**: Iterate through the array and swap elements to their correct positions as long as the element at the current index is a positive integer, within bounds, and not already in the correct position.
   - **Second Pass**: After rearranging, iterate through the array again to find the first index where the element does not equal its index + 1, indicating that this index + 1 is the smallest missing positive integer.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Rearrangement Loop**:
   - The loop runs through each element and checks if itâ€™s a valid positive integer that should be placed at its corresponding index.
   - If conditions are met, it swaps the current element with the element at its target index and decrements `i` to check the swapped element again.
   
2. **Missing Positive Check**:
   - After rearranging, a second loop checks each index to see if the element at that index matches the expected value (`index + 1`).
   - If a mismatch is found, it returns the expected value as the first missing positive integer.

3. **Final Return**:
   - If all numbers from `1` to `n` (where `n` is the size of the array) are present, the function returns `n + 1` as the smallest missing positive.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in \(O(n)\) since it involves two linear passes through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as it rearranges the array in place without using additional data structures.
