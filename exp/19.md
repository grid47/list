### Problem Statement
Given the head of a linked list, remove the \(n^{th}\) node from the end of the list and return its head.

### Approach
1. **Calculate Size**: First, traverse the linked list to calculate its size.
2. **Identify Target Node**: Compute the target index (0-based) of the node to remove using the formula \( \text{target} = \text{size} - n \).
3. **Special Case**: If the target index equals zero (meaning we need to remove the head node), return `head->next`.
4. **Traverse to Target Node**: Use a loop to reach the node just before the target node.
5. **Modify Links**: Adjust the `next` pointer of the previous node to skip the target node.
6. **Return Head**: Finally, return the head of the modified linked list.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Define a pointer `node` to traverse the list and a variable `sz` to keep track of the size.

2. **Calculate Size**:
   - Loop through the list, moving `node` to the next node until it reaches the end, while incrementing `sz`.

3. **Determine Target Index**:
   - Calculate the target index as `tgt = sz - n`.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `sz == n`, the head node is to be removed. Return `head->next`.

5. **Traverse to the Node Before Target**:
   - Loop through the list until reaching the node just before the target node.

6. **Remove the Target Node**:
   - If the target node is not `nullptr`, change the `next` pointer of the current node to skip the target node.

7. **Return the Modified List**:
   - Return the head of the modified list.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(L)\), where \(L\) is the length of the linked list, since we need to traverse the list twice: once to calculate the size and once to remove the target node.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as no additional data structures are used that grow with the input size.
