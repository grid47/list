### Problem Statement

The problem requires us to determine how many words in a given list of strings begin and end with a vowel. We're provided with an array of strings and a list of query ranges, and our task is to efficiently calculate, for each query, how many words in the specified range begin and end with a vowel.

- **Words**: Each word in the list is a string.
- **Vowels**: The vowels in this problem are the characters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.
- **Queries**: Each query is a pair of indices `[l, r]`, and for each query, we need to find how many words in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) start and end with a vowel.

The goal is to efficiently answer all the queries based on the given list of words.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we will use **prefix sums** combined with **preprocessing**. The idea is to preprocess the list of words to check whether each word starts and ends with a vowel, then use this information to quickly answer the queries. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how we approach this:

1. **Vowel Check**:
   - For each word in the list, check whether the first and last characters are vowels.
   - If both characters are vowels, mark that word as valid.
   
2. **Prefix Sum Array**:
   - We will create an array `cnt` where `cnt[i]` holds the cumulative number of valid words (words that start and end with a vowel) from the start of the list up to index `i`.
   - This allows us to quickly compute the number of valid words in any range `[l, r]` using the formula:
     \[
     \text{cnt}[r] - \text{cnt}[l-1]
     \]
   - If `l` is 0, then simply `cnt[r]` gives the correct result for that query.

3. **Answering Queries**:
   - For each query `[l, r]`, the number of valid words in the range can be found by subtracting the cumulative count up to `l-1` from the cumulative count up to `r`. This can be done in constant time due to the prefix sum array.

### Code Breakdown

Let's break down the code step by step:

#### Step 1: Initialize Data Structures

```cpp
int n = words.size();
vector<int> cnt(n, 0), ans(q.size(), 0);
set<char> ch = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
```

- `n`: The number of words in the list.
- `cnt`: A vector that will store the cumulative count of valid words. Initially, all elements are set to 0.
- `ans`: A vector that will store the result for each query. The size of `ans` is equal to the number of queries (`q.size()`).
- `ch`: A set containing the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). We use this set to check if a character is a vowel.

#### Step 2: Preprocess the Words

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if(ch.count(words[i][0]) && ch.count(words[i][words[i].size() - 1]))
        cnt[i] = 1;
    if(i > 0) cnt[i] += cnt[i - 1];
}
```

- **Vowel Check**: For each word in the `words` array:
  - Check if the first character (`words[i][0]`) and the last character (`words[i][words[i].size() - 1]`) are both vowels. This is done using `ch.count()`, which returns `1` if the character is in the set of vowels, and `0` otherwise.
  - If both the first and last characters are vowels, mark `cnt[i] = 1`, indicating that the word is valid.
  
- **Prefix Sum**: After marking the current word as valid, we update the `cnt[i]` to be the cumulative sum of valid words up to index `i`. If `i > 0`, we add `cnt[i - 1]` to the current value of `cnt[i]`. This ensures that `cnt[i]` will hold the count of valid words from index `0` to `i`.

#### Step 3: Answer the Queries

```cpp
for(int i= 0; i < q.size(); i++) {
    ans[i] = cnt[q[i][1]] - ((q[i][0] > 0)? cnt[q[i][0] - 1]: 0);
}
```

- **Query Loop**: For each query in the list of queries `q`, which contains pairs `[l, r]`, the number of valid words in the range `[l, r]` can be computed as:
  - If `l > 0`, the result is `cnt[r] - cnt[l - 1]`.
  - If `l == 0`, the result is simply `cnt[r]`.
  
This uses the prefix sum approach to compute the result in constant time for each query.

#### Step 4: Return the Results

```cpp
return ans;
```

- Finally, we return the `ans` vector containing the result for each query.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:

1. **Preprocessing the Words**:
   - We iterate over each word in the `words` array and check the first and last characters. This operation takes \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of words.
   - Additionally, we perform the cumulative sum operation, which takes \(O(n)\).
   
   Therefore, the time complexity for preprocessing is \(O(n)\).

2. **Answering the Queries**:
   - For each query, we compute the result in constant time, i.e., \(O(1)\).
   - If there are `m` queries, the total time complexity for answering all queries is \(O(m)\).
   
Therefore, the total time complexity is:
\[
O(n + m)
\]
where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the number of queries.

#### Space Complexity:

- We use a vector `cnt` of size `n` to store the cumulative count of valid words.
- We use a vector `ans` of size `m` to store the results of the queries.
- The set `ch` stores 5 characters (the vowels), which is constant space.

Thus, the space complexity is:
\[
O(n + m)
\]
where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the number of queries.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently preprocesses the list of words and answers each query in constant time using a prefix sum approach. The time complexity is linear with respect to the number of words and queries, making this solution optimal for large input sizes. By using a set to check for vowels and maintaining a prefix sum array, we avoid unnecessary recomputation and ensure fast query resolution.
