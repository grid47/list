### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `fruits` representing different types of fruits, you need to determine the maximum number of fruits that can be collected in a basket, where each basket can only hold at most two different types of fruits.

### Class Definition
- **Class**: `Solution`
  - **Method**: `int totalFruit(vector<int>& fruits)`
    - Takes a vector of integers `fruits`, where each integer represents a type of fruit.
    - Returns the maximum number of fruits that can be collected.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a map `mp` to count the occurrences of each fruit type.
   - Initialize two pointers, `j` (start of the window) and `res` (to store the result), and `dst` (to count distinct fruit types).

2. **Iterate Over Fruits**:
   - For each fruit at index `i`, increment its count in `mp`.
   - If it's the first occurrence of this fruit, increment `dst`.

3. **Check Distinct Fruits**:
   - If `dst` is less than or equal to 2, update `res` with the current window size (`i - j + 1`).
   - If `dst` exceeds 2, increment `j` to shrink the window until `dst` is reduced to 2 or less, updating the counts in `mp` accordingly.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the maximum length of the subarray with at most two distinct fruit types.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of fruits, as each fruit is processed at most twice (once when added and once when removed).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) in terms of fruit types, but O(k) in practice, where k is the number of distinct fruits in the input (up to a constant based on the types of fruits).
