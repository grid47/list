### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target. Assume that each input has exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Approach
1. **Hash Map**:
   - Use a hash map (or unordered map) to store the difference between the target and each element as you iterate through the array.
   - For each element, check if it exists in the map:
     - If it does, return the indices of the current element and the element stored in the map.
     - If it doesn't, store the current element's value and its index in the map.
   
### Code Walk-through
- **Lines 1-2**: Define the function and initialize a vector `ans` to hold the two indices.
- **Line 3**: Create a map `mp` to store the values and their corresponding indices.
- **Lines 4-11**: Iterate through the array:
  - Check if the current number is already in the map.
  - If it is, store the indices in `ans` and return it.
  - If it isnâ€™t, compute the difference between the target and the current number and store it in the map with its index.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in `nums`, as we traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for storing elements in the hash map.
