### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target value. Given an array of integers, `nums`, and an integer `target`, the task is to find two indices such that the numbers at these indices sum up to the target. The solution should return the 1-based indices of these two numbers.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a **hash map** (in this case, `map` in C++) to store the numbers we've already encountered while iterating through the array. This allows us to check in constant time if the complement of the current number (i.e., `target - current_number`) exists in the array. This approach reduces the time complexity from a brute force **O(n^2)** solution to a more efficient **O(n)** solution.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's break down the code step by step to understand how the solution works:

#### Step 1: Initialize the Variables

```cpp
vector<int> ans(2, 0);
map<int, int> mp;
```
- `ans` is a vector that will store the two indices of the numbers that sum up to the target. It is initialized with two zeroes as placeholders.
- `mp` is a map (or hash table) that will be used to store the complement of each number as we iterate through the list. The key in the map will be `target - nums[i]` (the complement), and the value will be the index `i` of the number.

#### Step 2: Iterate Through the Array

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
    if(mp.count(nums[i])) {
        ans[0] = mp[nums[i]] + 1;
        ans[1] = i + 1;
        return ans;
    } else {
        mp[target - nums[i]] = i;
    }
}
```

- The `for` loop iterates through each element in the array `nums`.
  
  **Inside the loop**:
  - **Check if the current number exists in the map (`mp`)**:
    - If `mp.count(nums[i])` is true, it means the complement (`target - nums[i]`) has been encountered before in the array. Therefore, we have found the pair that adds up to the target.
    - We then set `ans[0] = mp[nums[i]] + 1` and `ans[1] = i + 1` to store the 1-based indices of the two numbers. We return the result immediately.
  
  - **If the complement is not found in the map**:
    - We store the complement of the current number (`target - nums[i]`) as the key in the map, with the current index `i` as the value. This way, when we encounter the complement in the future, we can easily retrieve the index of the previous number.

#### Step 3: Return the Result

```cpp
return ans;
```

- If no pair is found (which theoretically shouldn't happen according to the problem's constraints, as there is always exactly one solution), we return `ans`. However, the design assumes the problem guarantees one solution, so we would always return the answer during the loop.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The solution iterates over the array `nums` once. During each iteration, we check if a number exists in the map (which takes constant time, O(1), on average), and then we update the map with the complement. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the size of the array.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The space complexity is dominated by the space used by the map `mp`. In the worst case, the map will store `n` elements (one for each number in the array). Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).

### Conclusion

This solution is highly efficient with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n). It optimally leverages a **hash map** to track the complements of the numbers and check for pairs that sum up to the target in constant time. This approach avoids the need for a nested loop, which would result in a less efficient **O(n^2)** solution.

#### Key Takeaways:
- The algorithm relies on the idea of storing the complement of each number in a map as we iterate through the array.
- This allows us to check for the presence of the complement in constant time and return the result once a valid pair is found.
- The time complexity of **O(n)** ensures that the solution is efficient even for large input sizes.
- The use of **O(n)** space for the map is a tradeoff for the time efficiency gained from constant-time lookups.

This solution is ideal for problems where you need to find pairs that sum up to a specific value in an array, as it ensures minimal time complexity with clear and understandable logic.
