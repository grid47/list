### Problem Statement
Given two points `(sx, sy)` and `(tx, ty)`, you can transform the starting point into the target point by performing a series of operations:
1. You can add the coordinates together: 
   - From `(a, b)`, you can move to `(a + b, b)` or `(a, a + b)`.
   
The task is to determine if you can reach `(tx, ty)` from `(sx, sy)` using these operations.

### Approach
1. **Mathematical Reduction**:
   - The goal is to find a way to reduce the problem instead of simulating each step.
   - By continually applying the modulo operation, you can deduce if it's possible to reach the target without generating all intermediate points.

2. **Base Conditions**:
   - When both coordinates of the starting point are less than those of the target point, you compare which coordinate is larger and adjust the larger coordinate using the modulo operation.

3. **Final Check**:
   - Once the loop exits, you check:
     - If the x-coordinates match, ensure the y-coordinate can be reached with the given steps.
     - If the y-coordinates match, ensure the x-coordinate can be reached with the given steps.

### Code Walk-through
- **Methods**:
  - `bool pts(int sx, int sy, int tx, int ty)`: This recursive helper function checks if you can reach `(tx, ty)` from `(sx, sy)` using the defined operations. It's memoized for optimization.
  - `bool reachingPoints(int sx, int sy, int tx, int ty)`: This is the main function implementing the mathematical reduction approach.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log(max(tx, ty))) due to the reduction in each step using the modulo operation.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the iterative approach; O(m) for the memoization, where `m` is the number of unique states stored in `mp`.
