### Problem Statement
Given an array of strings `equations` that represent equality and inequality relations between lowercase characters, determine if it's possible to assign values to each character so that all equations are satisfied.

### Approach
- Use Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) to group variables that are specified as equal.
- If two variables are in the same group but an inequality equation requires them to be unequal, the equations are unsatisfiable.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Union-Find Class (`UF`)**:
   - **Initialization**: Initializes a parent array (`chd`) to track connected components, setting each element as its own parent initially.
   - **Union (`uni`)**: Connects two components by updating the parent of one component to another.
   - **Find (`find`)**: Uses path compression to efficiently find the root of a component.

2. **Solution Class**:
   - **Union Equalities**: For equations of the form `a==b`, connect the components of `a` and `b` using the `uni` method.
   - **Check Inequalities**: For equations of the form `a!=b`, check if `a` and `b` belong to the same component. If they do, return false, as it contradicts the inequality.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * α(n)), where n is the number of equations and α is the inverse Ackermann function, due to efficient union-find operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(26), fixed for the number of lowercase letters.
