### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, the task is to count the number of palindromic substrings in `s`. A substring is palindromic if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
   - Use a 2D DP table `mem` where `mem[i][j]` will store whether the substring `s[i...j]` is a palindrome.
   - Initialize `mem` with `-1` to indicate uncalculated states.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Define a recursive function `dp(i, j)` that checks if `s[i]` is equal to `s[j]`.
   - If they are equal, it checks the substring `s[i+1...j-1]`.
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to `j`, it indicates a single character or an empty substring, which is always a palindrome.

3. **Count Palindromic Substrings**:
   - Iterate through all possible starting and ending indices of substrings. For each substring, call the `dp` function to determine if it is a palindrome and accumulate the count.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the total count of palindromic substrings found.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - The string is assigned to the member variable `s`, and the `mem` table is initialized.

2. **Nested Loop**:
   - Use two loops to iterate through all possible substrings, calling `dp` for each pair of indices.

3. **Final Count**:
   - The result is accumulated in `ans`, which is returned at the end.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^3), where n is the length of the string due to the two nested loops and the recursion.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) for the `mem` table used to store results of subproblems.
