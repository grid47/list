### Problem Statement

The problem requires generating all possible letter combinations that the number sequence on a telephone keypad could represent. Each digit from 2 to 9 on a keypad corresponds to a set of letters. The task is to return all possible letter combinations that can be formed by a given string of digits.

For instance, given the digits `"23"`, the corresponding combinations would be: 
- "ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf".

The output must contain all possible combinations formed from the digits in the order in which they are given.

### Approach

The problem is based on the mapping of digits to letters, as found on a phone's keypad. A mapping is established for each digit from `2` to `9`, and the goal is to generate all possible combinations of letters corresponding to a given sequence of digits.

To solve this problem efficiently, we can approach it using an iterative strategy, building the combinations progressively for each digit in the input. Letâ€™s break this approach into clear steps.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Mapping Digits to Letters**: 
   - Each digit from `2` to `9` maps to a list of letters. For example, the digit `'2'` corresponds to `['a', 'b', 'c']`. This mapping is stored in a `map` (or `unordered_map`), which allows for quick lookup.

2. **Starting with the First Digit**:
   - Begin by taking the letter combinations for the first digit and storing them in a list.

3. **Iterative Combination Building**:
   - For each subsequent digit, take the combinations already generated and append all the possible letters corresponding to the current digit to them. This is done iteratively for every digit.

4. **Final Result**:
   - After processing all digits, the list will contain all possible combinations of the letters corresponding to the digits.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Create the Digit-to-Letter Mapping

```cpp
map<char, vector<string>> mp;
mp['2'] = { "a", "b", "c" };
mp['3'] = { "d", "e", "f" };
mp['4'] = { "g", "h", "i" };
mp['5'] = { "j", "k", "l" };
mp['6'] = { "m", "n", "o" };
mp['7'] = { "p", "q", "r", "s" };
mp['8'] = { "t", "u", "v" };
mp['9'] = { "w", "x", "y", "z" };
```
- The `map<char, vector<string>>` is used to store the letter mappings for each digit from `2` to `9`. Each key in the map corresponds to a digit, and the value is a vector of strings, where each string represents a letter associated with that digit.

#### Step 2: Initialize the Answer with the First Digit

```cpp
vector<string> ans, tmp;
ans = mp[digits[0]];
```
- Here, we initialize the result list `ans` with the letter combinations corresponding to the first digit in the input string `digits`. Since the result for the first digit is simply the set of letters mapped to that digit, we can directly assign it to `ans`.

#### Step 3: Iterative Combination Building

```cpp
for(int i = 1; i < digits.size(); i++) {
    tmp = ans;  // Temporary copy of the current answer list
    ans = {};   // Reset the answer list for the new combinations
    
    for(int j = 0; j < mp[digits[i]].size(); j++) {
        for(int k = 0; k < tmp.size(); k++)
            ans.push_back(tmp[k] + mp[digits[i]][j]);
    }
}
```
- The outer loop (`for(int i = 1; i < digits.size(); i++)`) starts from the second digit (`digits[1]`).
- For each digit, we create a temporary list `tmp` which holds the current combinations generated so far (from previous iterations). We then clear the `ans` list to make room for the new combinations formed with the current digit.
- The inner loops iterate over all the letters corresponding to the current digit (`mp[digits[i]]`) and append them to all the combinations already generated. This way, for each letter in `mp[digits[i]]`, we append it to every string in `tmp` and store the result back into `ans`.

#### Step 4: Return the Final Answer

```cpp
return ans;
```
- After iterating over all digits, the `ans` list contains all possible combinations. We return this list as the result.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- Sorting and iterating through the digits in the input string involves iterating over the entire string, which takes **O(d)** time, where `d` is the length of the input string `digits`.
- For each digit, the number of possible combinations increases exponentially because each digit can have a variable number of letters (e.g., 3 for most digits and 4 for digits like `7` and `9`). Therefore, the total number of combinations grows as **O(3^d)**, where `d` is the number of digits in the input string.
- The overall time complexity can be approximated as **O(3^d)**, where `d` is the length of the input string, assuming that each digit can correspond to up to 4 letters (which happens for `7` and `9`).

#### Space Complexity:
- We need space to store all the possible combinations, which in the worst case is **O(3^d)**, where `d` is the length of the input string. This is because the number of combinations grows exponentially.
- Therefore, the space complexity is **O(3^d)**.

### Conclusion

This solution effectively generates all possible letter combinations for a given string of digits. The approach uses an iterative method to build the combinations progressively by starting from the first digit and expanding combinations as new digits are added. The use of a `map` allows for efficient lookups of the corresponding letters for each digit, and the solution ensures that all combinations are generated in the correct order.

The time complexity is **O(3^d)** due to the exponential growth of possible combinations, while the space complexity is also **O(3^d)** due to storing these combinations. This solution works efficiently for moderate-sized inputs and leverages a simple yet effective approach to solving the problem.
