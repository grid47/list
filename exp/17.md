### Problem Statement
Given a string containing digits from 2-9, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent based on the mapping of digits to letters on a phone keypad.

### Approach
Use a map to associate each digit with its corresponding letters, then use a combination of loops to generate the letter combinations based on the input digits.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Mapping Digits to Letters**:
   - Create a map `mp` where each key is a digit ('2' to '9') and the value is a vector of strings representing the letters corresponding to that digit.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Create a vector `ans` to store the resulting combinations. Initialize it with the letters corresponding to the first digit in `digits`.

3. **Iterate Over Digits**:
   - Loop through the remaining digits in the input string:
     - Store the current combinations in a temporary vector `tmp`.
     - Clear `ans` to prepare for the new combinations.

4. **Generating Combinations**:
   - For each letter corresponding to the current digit:
     - Loop through all existing combinations in `tmp`.
     - Concatenate the current letter to each combination and add it to `ans`.

5. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all digits, return the vector `ans` containing all possible letter combinations.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(3^n \cdot 4^m)\) where \(n\) is the number of digits corresponding to 3 letters and \(m\) is the number corresponding to 4 letters, as this reflects the branching factor of combinations.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) for the additional space used, although the output size can be significant depending on the input.
