### Problem Statement
The problem involves a garden of length `n` that can be watered using `n` taps, where each tap can water a specific range defined by its radius. Given the ranges of the taps, the task is to find the minimum number of taps needed to cover the entire garden. If it's not possible to cover the garden with the available taps, the function should return `-1`.

### Approach
The solution employs a dynamic programming (DP) approach combined with binary search for efficient range coverage calculation. The core idea is to:

1. **Define Coverage Intervals**:
   - For each tap, calculate its effective coverage range based on its position and radius.

2. **Sort Intervals**:
   - Sort the calculated intervals to facilitate the finding of overlapping ranges.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a recursive DP function with memoization to compute the minimum number of taps needed to reach the end of the garden from each starting point.

4. **Binary Search**:
   - Implement binary search to quickly find the next tap that can extend the coverage.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Class and Variable Declarations**:
   - The `Solution` class includes member variables for the size of the garden (`n`), a memoization vector (`memo`), and a vector of intervals (`win`).

   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
       int n;
       vector<int> memo;
       vector<vector<int>> win;
   ```

2. **Binary Search Function**:
   - The `bs` function performs a binary search to find the maximum index of the tap that can extend the coverage starting from the current tap's coverage.

   ```cpp
   int bs(int idx, int num) {
       int l = idx, r = win.size() - 1;
       int ans = -1;
       while(l <= r) {
           int mid = l + (r - l + 1) / 2;
           if(win[mid][0] <= num) {
               ans = mid;
               l = mid + 1;
           } else r = mid - 1;
       }
       return ans;
   }
   ```

3. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   - The `dp` function calculates the minimum taps needed starting from a specific tap index. It checks for the base cases, computes the next possible taps using binary search, and recursively computes the minimum taps required.

   ```cpp
   int dp(int idx) {
       if(idx == win.size()) return INT_MAX;
       if(win[idx][1] >= n) return 1;
       if(win[idx][1] == win[idx][0]) return INT_MAX;        
       if (memo[idx] != -1) return memo[idx];
       
       int ans = INT_MAX;
       int nxt = bs(idx + 1, win[idx][1]);
       if(nxt != -1) {
           for(int i = idx + 1; i <= nxt; i++) {
               int ret = dp(i);
               ans = min(ans, ret == INT_MAX ? ret : ret + 1);
           }
       }

       return memo[idx] = ans;
   }
   ```

4. **Main Function to Find Minimum Taps**:
   - The `minTaps` function initializes the intervals based on the taps, sorts them, and initiates the DP process. It checks all taps that can cover the starting position of the garden and finds the minimum required taps.

   ```cpp
   int minTaps(int n, vector<int>& r) {
       this->n = n;
       for(int i = 0; i < r.size(); i++)
           win.push_back({i - r[i], i + r[i]});
       sort(win.begin(), win.end());
       memo.resize(r.size() + 1, -1);
       int ret = INT_MAX;
       for(int i = 0; i < r.size() && win[i][0] <= 0; i++)
           ret = min(dp(i), ret);
       return ret == INT_MAX ? -1 : ret;
   }
   ```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The overall time complexity is \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of taps. This includes the time to sort the intervals and the time taken by the binary search and DP.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(N)\) due to the storage of the `win` vector and the `memo` array used for memoization.

### Conclusion
The provided code efficiently solves the problem of determining the minimum number of taps needed to water a garden by employing a combination of dynamic programming and binary search techniques. By systematically calculating the coverage ranges and utilizing memoization, the solution effectively reduces the number of computations required. This approach exemplifies how advanced algorithmic techniques can be used to tackle combinatorial problems in an efficient manner. 

In scenarios where ranges overlap and need careful management, this algorithm provides an optimal method to ensure that the entire range is covered with the fewest taps possible. The solution is a solid example of applying concepts from algorithm design and data structures in practical problem-solving situations.
