### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and a string `t`, find the minimum window in `s` which will contain all the characters in `t` (including duplicates). If there is no such window, return the empty string `""`.

### Approach
1. **Character Count Map**: Use a map to count the frequency of each character in `t`.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Use two pointers, `i` (start of the window) and `j` (end of the window), to expand and contract the current window in `s`.
   - A counter (`cnt`) is used to track how many characters from `t` are currently in the window.

3. **Expand the Window**:
   - Move the `j` pointer to the right, adding characters from `s` to the current window. Decrease the count for each character in the map when added.

4. **Contract the Window**:
   - When the current window contains all characters of `t` (when `cnt` equals zero), attempt to minimize the window by moving the `i` pointer to the right until the window no longer contains all characters.

5. **Update Minimum Length**:
   - Keep track of the smallest valid window found during the process.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: Create a frequency map for characters in `t`. Initialize variables to track the current window size and its start index.
2. **Iterate through `s`**:
   - For each character, update the map and decrease the counter if it’s in `t`.
   - When the window contains all characters, check if it’s smaller than previously found windows and update the minimum length.
   - Move the left pointer to try to minimize the window size.
3. **Return the Result**: After processing all characters, return the smallest valid window or an empty string if none is found.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of string `s`, as each character is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(m) \), where \( m \) is the number of unique characters in `t`, to store their counts in the map.
