### Problem Statement
Given an array representing couples sitting in a row, where each person is represented by a unique integer, the task is to find the minimum number of swaps required to ensure that each couple sits next to each other.

### Approach
1. **Position Mapping**:
   - Create an array `pos` to store the current index of each person.
   - Create an array `ptn` to define the desired pattern where couples should sit together (even indexed with the next index).

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - Iterate through the array. For each person, determine if they are sitting in the correct position.
   - If not, swap them with their couple (using the `ptn` array to find the couple's expected position).
   - Update the position array after each swap and increment the swap count.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method for calculating the minimum swaps.

- **Method**:
  - `int minSwapsCouples(vector<int>& row)`: This method implements the logic to find the minimum number of swaps needed for couples to sit together.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the size of the row array, as each person is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the position and pattern arrays.
