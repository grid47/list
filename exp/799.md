### Problem Statement
You have a champagne tower where champagne is poured into the top glass. Each glass can hold a maximum of one liter of champagne. If a glass overflows, the excess champagne is poured equally into the two glasses directly below it. Given the amount of champagne poured, and a specific glass at a certain row, return how much champagne is in that glass after pouring.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Current Row**:
   - Start with a vector `currRow` initialized with the amount of champagne poured into the top glass.

2. **Simulate the Pouring Process**:
   - For each row from 0 to `query_row`:
     - Create a new vector `nextrow` to store the amounts for the next row, initialized to zero.
     - For each glass in the current row:
       - If the amount in the glass is greater than or equal to 1 liter, calculate the overflow:
         - Distribute half of the overflow to the glass directly below (left) and half to the glass directly below (right).
         - Set the current glass amount to 1 liter (the maximum capacity).
     - If the current row is not the query row, update `currRow` to be `nextrow`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing up to the `query_row`, return the amount in `currRow[query_glass]`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to determine the champagne in a specific glass.
    - `double champagneTower(int poured, int query_row, int query_glass)`: Implements the logic for calculating the champagne amount.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `poured`: An integer representing the total amount of champagne poured.
        - `query_row`: An integer representing the row number of the glass to query.
        - `query_glass`: An integer representing the glass number to query.
      - **Returns**: A double representing the amount of champagne in the specified glass.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(row^2), where row is the number of rows processed (up to `query_row`). Each row involves processing the number of glasses corresponding to its index.
- **Space Complexity**: O(row), as only the current row and the next row are stored during the simulation.
