### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The subsequence must be strictly increasing, and the order of elements must be preserved.

### Approach
The solution uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**:
   - Create a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. Initialize all values in `dp` to `1`, since the minimum length of an increasing subsequence is `1` (the element itself).

2. **Nested Loop for DP Calculation**:
   - Iterate through each element `nums[i]` in the array.
   - For each `nums[i]`, iterate through all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`).
   - If `nums[j] < nums[i]`, update `dp[i]` as `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.
   - Track the maximum value in the `dp` array to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

3. **Final Result**:
   - The length of the longest increasing subsequence will be the maximum value in the `dp` array after processing all elements.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A vector of integers `nums`.
- **Output**: An integer representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

1. Initialize the size of `nums` as `n` and the `dp` array.
2. Use nested loops to fill the `dp` array based on the conditions outlined.
3. Return the maximum value from the `dp` array.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) due to the nested loops, where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the `dp` array used to store lengths.
