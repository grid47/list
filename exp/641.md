### Problem Statement
Design and implement a circular deque (double-ended queue) with the following operations:
- `insertFront(value)`: Adds an item at the front of the deque.
- `insertLast(value)`: Adds an item at the back of the deque.
- `deleteFront()`: Deletes an item from the front of the deque.
- `deleteLast()`: Deletes an item from the back of the deque.
- `getFront()`: Gets the front item from the deque.
- `getRear()`: Gets the last item from the deque.
- `isEmpty()`: Checks whether the deque is empty.
- `isFull()`: Checks whether the deque is full.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a vector to store the deque elements.
   - Maintain pointers for the front and back of the deque, and track the size and current count of elements.

2. **Insert Operations**:
   - For `insertFront`, place the value at the front pointer, then update the front pointer in a circular manner.
   - For `insertLast`, place the value at the back pointer, then update the back pointer in a circular manner.
   - Both operations check for fullness before inserting.

3. **Delete Operations**:
   - For `deleteFront`, simply move the front pointer forward.
   - For `deleteLast`, move the back pointer backward.
   - Both operations check for emptiness before deleting.

4. **Get Operations**:
   - `getFront` and `getRear` return the values at the respective pointers, ensuring to handle cases when the deque is empty.

5. **Check Operations**:
   - `isEmpty` returns true if the count of elements is zero.
   - `isFull` returns true if the count is equal to the size.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Constructor**: Initializes the deque with a fixed size, setting all elements to zero and the pointers accordingly.
2. **Insert Functions**: Each function updates the respective pointer and increments the count, returning false if the deque is full.
3. **Delete Functions**: Each function decrements the count and adjusts the respective pointer, returning false if the deque is empty.
4. **Get Functions**: Retrieve values based on the current state of the pointers while handling edge cases for empty states.
5. **Size Checks**: The empty and full checks rely on a simple count comparison.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: All operations run in O(1) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the capacity of the deque.
