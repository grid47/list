### Problem Statement
The `TopVotedCandidate` class records votes for candidates over time and allows you to query who the leading candidate was at any given time.

### Class Definition
- **Class**: `TopVotedCandidate`
  - **Constructor**: 
    ```cpp
    TopVotedCandidate(vector<int>& persons, vector<int>& times)
    ```
    - **Parameters**:
      - `persons`: A vector of integers representing the IDs of candidates receiving votes.
      - `times`: A vector of integers representing the timestamps corresponding to each vote.
    - **Purpose**: Initializes the `TopVotedCandidate` object and tracks the leading candidate at each vote timestamp.

  - **Method**:
    ```cpp
    int q(int t)
    ```
    - **Parameters**:
      - `t`: An integer representing a timestamp.
    - **Returns**: The ID of the candidate who was the leading candidate at time `t`.

### Approach
1. **Vote Counting**:
   - Maintain a `map<int, int>` to store the leading candidate at each time stamp.
   - Use an `unordered_map<int, int>` to count the votes for each candidate.
   - As you iterate through the `persons` and `times` vectors:
     - Increment the vote count for the current candidate.
     - Update the leading candidate if the current candidate has the highest vote count or ties with the current leader.

2. **Querying**:
   - For a given timestamp `t`, use `mp.upper_bound(t)` to find the latest time less than or equal to `t`.
   - Return the candidate ID associated with that time.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Constructor: O(n log n), where n is the number of votes (due to the map insertions).
  - Query: O(log n) for finding the upper bound in the map.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the candidate counts and the mapping of times to leading candidates.

### Example Usage
```cpp
TopVotedCandidate* obj = new TopVotedCandidate(persons, times);
int param_1 = obj->q(t);
