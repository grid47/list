### Problem Statement
The task is to rotate a given \( n \times n \) matrix (2D vector) by 90 degrees clockwise. This rotation should be performed in-place, meaning no additional matrix should be used.

### Approach
1. **Transpose the Matrix**:
   - Swap the elements across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right). This will turn rows into columns.

2. **Reverse Rows**:
   - After transposing, reverse each row of the matrix. This will effectively rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `rotate` function takes a reference to a 2D vector `mtx`.

2. **Reverse Rows**:
   - A while loop iterates from the start (`i = 0`) to the end (`j = mtx.size() - 1`) of the matrix, swapping the rows `mtx[i]` and `mtx[j]`. This effectively reverses the order of rows in the matrix.

3. **Transpose the Matrix**:
   - A nested for loop iterates through the matrix:
     - The outer loop iterates through each row (`i`).
     - The inner loop iterates through the columns (`j`), starting from `i + 1` to avoid re-swapping elements.
     - The `swap` function is used to swap elements `mtx[i][j]` and `mtx[j][i]`, transposing the matrix.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \) for transposing the matrix and reversing the rows, where \( n \) is the dimension of the square matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \) since the operation is performed in-place with no extra space used other than a few variables.
