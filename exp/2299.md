### Problem Statement

The task is to implement a function that checks whether a given password satisfies specific security criteria. The password is considered strong if it meets the following conditions:

1. The length of the password must be at least 8 characters.
2. The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
3. The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
4. The password must contain at least one digit.
5. The password must not contain two consecutive characters that are the same.

Given a password string `p`, the goal is to determine whether it meets all these conditions and return `true` if it is a strong password, or `false` otherwise.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to check each of the five conditions for a valid password. We will iterate through the password string, checking the following:

- The length of the string.
- Whether the string contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit.
- Whether the string contains any consecutive repeating characters.

Here is the step-by-step approach to implement the solution:

1. **Iterate through the password**: Traverse each character of the password string to check if it satisfies the conditions for being a strong password.
2. **Track the conditions**: Use flags or counters to track whether weâ€™ve encountered at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit. Also, ensure that no two consecutive characters are the same.
3. **Early exit**: As soon as we detect a violation of any of the conditions, we can return `false` early.
4. **Final checks**: After traversing the string, ensure that the password meets all the conditions. If any of the conditions are violated, return `false`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Initialize Counters**:
   - We use three counters: `lo`, `up`, and `digit` to track the number of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits, respectively.
   - We also store the size of the password in `sz`.

   ```cpp
   int lo = 0, up = 0, digit = 0, sz = p.size();
   ```

2. **Iterate Through the Password**:
   - We use a loop to iterate over each character of the password `p`:
   
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < sz; ++i) {
   ```

3. **Check for Consecutive Characters**:
   - We check whether the current character `p[i]` is the same as the previous character `p[i-1]`. If they are the same, we immediately return `false` because the password contains two consecutive identical characters.
   
   ```cpp
   if (i > 0 && p[i - 1] == p[i]) {
       return false;
   }
   ```

4. **Count Lowercase Letters**:
   - We check if the current character is a lowercase letter using the `islower()` function. If it is, we increment the `lo` counter by 1.

   ```cpp
   lo += islower(p[i]) ? 1 : 0;
   ```

5. **Count Uppercase Letters**:
   - Similarly, we check if the current character is an uppercase letter using the `isupper()` function. If it is, we increment the `up` counter by 1.

   ```cpp
   up += isupper(p[i]) ? 1 : 0;
   ```

6. **Count Digits**:
   - We check if the current character is a digit using the `isdigit()` function. If it is, we increment the `digit` counter by 1.

   ```cpp
   digit += isdigit(p[i]) ? 1 : 0;
   ```

7. **Final Check for Password Validity**:
   - After finishing the iteration, we check the following conditions:
     1. The length of the password must be greater than 7 characters (`sz > 7`).
     2. There must be at least one lowercase letter (`lo` must be greater than 0).
     3. There must be at least one uppercase letter (`up` must be greater than 0).
     4. There must be at least one digit (`digit` must be greater than 0).
     5. The number of characters that are neither lowercase, uppercase, nor digits (the remaining characters) must be greater than 0. This is checked by the condition `(sz - lo - up - digit > 0)`.
     
   ```cpp
   return sz > 7 && lo && up && digit && (sz - lo - up - digit > 0);
   ```

   If all conditions are satisfied, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:
**Input**:
```cpp
string password = "Password123!";
```

**Execution**:
1. The password length is 12, which is greater than 7, so the length condition is met.
2. The password contains at least one lowercase letter (`'P'`), one uppercase letter (`'p'`), and one digit (`'1'`), so the character type conditions are met.
3. The password does not contain two consecutive identical characters.
4. The number of non-alphabetic and non-digit characters is greater than 0, as there is an exclamation mark `!`.

**Output**:
```cpp
true
```

#### Example 2:
**Input**:
```cpp
string password = "aabbcc";
```

**Execution**:
1. The password length is 6, which is less than 8, so the length condition fails immediately.

**Output**:
```cpp
false
```

#### Example 3:
**Input**:
```cpp
string password = "Aa1bb!";
```

**Execution**:
1. The password length is 6, which is less than 8, so the length condition fails immediately.

**Output**:
```cpp
false
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the password. This is because we are iterating over each character of the password exactly once.
- Each condition check (`islower()`, `isupper()`, `isdigit()`, etc.) takes constant time, so the overall time complexity is linear.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are using a constant amount of extra space (only a few integer variables to store counts and the password length).
- We do not use any additional data structures whose size depends on the input size.

### Conclusion

The provided solution efficiently checks whether a given password satisfies the criteria for being a "strong" password. It uses a simple linear scan through the string to check the password's length, character types, and consecutive character rules, making the solution both time-efficient and space-efficient. This solution is well-suited for the problem as it guarantees correctness while maintaining optimal performance for large inputs.
