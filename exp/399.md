### 🚀 Problem Statement

Given a list of equations, each in the form `A / B = value`, and a list of queries in the form `A / B`, the task is to evaluate the result of each query based on the provided equations. If the query can be evaluated, return the result; otherwise, return `-1` if it is not possible to evaluate the expression.

To solve this, we can treat the problem as a graph traversal issue where:
- Each variable (like `A`, `B`, etc.) is a **node** in the graph.
- Each equation represents an **edge** with a weight that corresponds to the ratio between two variables.

### 🧠 Approach

This problem boils down to finding paths between nodes in a graph, where the path represents the division between variables. Let's break down the approach:

1. **Graph Representation**: 
   - We build a graph where each variable is a node. Each equation is represented as an edge with a weight that denotes the division ratio between two nodes.
   
2. **Graph Traversal with DFS**: 
   - For each query, perform a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** starting from the numerator variable. We aim to find a path to the denominator, accumulating the division ratios along the way.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the numerator and denominator are the same variable (like `A / A`), return `1` if they exist in the graph.
   - If there is no valid path between the numerator and denominator, return `-1`.

This method efficiently answers the queries based on the given equations!

### 🔨 Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Let's dive into the code to see how we implement this approach:

#### Step 1: **Graph Construction**

First, we need to build the graph:

```cpp
map<string, vector<pair<string, double>>> graph;

for (int i = 0; i < eqn.size(); i++) {
    double w = val[i];
    graph[eqn[i][0]].push_back(make_pair(eqn[i][1], w));
    if (w == 0) continue;
    graph[eqn[i][1]].push_back(make_pair(eqn[i][0], 1 / w));
}
```

- We use a map (`graph`) where each key is a variable (string), and the value is a list of pairs. Each pair contains a connected variable and the division ratio.
- For every equation `A / B = value`, we add two edges:
  - `A` to `B` with weight `value`
  - `B` to `A` with weight `1 / value`

This way, we represent the entire set of equations as a graph!

#### Step 2: **Processing Queries**

Now that we have the graph, let's process each query:

```cpp
vector<double> ans;

for (int i = 0; i < q.size(); i++) {
    set<string> vis;
    double res = dfs(q[i][0], q[i][1], vis, graph);
    if (res < 0) res = -1;
    ans.push_back(res);
}
```

- We iterate through each query, and for each one, we perform a DFS search from the numerator to the denominator.
- A set `vis` tracks the nodes we've already visited to avoid cycles and unnecessary re-traversals.

---

#### Step 3: **DFS Traversal**

Here's the core part of the algorithm where DFS is used to search for the path between variables:

```cpp
double dfs(string start, string end, set<string> &vis, map<string, vector<pair<string, double>>> &gph) {
    if (start == end) return gph.count(start) ? 1 : -1;
    vis.insert(start);
    double ans = -1;
    for (pair<string, double> x : gph[start]) {
        if (vis.count(x.first)) continue;
        
        double res = x.second * dfs(x.first, end, vis, gph);
        if (res < 0) continue;
        return res;
    }
    return ans;
}
```

- **Base Case**: If `start == end`, return `1` if the node exists in the graph (indicating that `A / A = 1`).
- **DFS Traversal**: For each adjacent node, we recursively search for a path, accumulating the product of the ratios.
- If a valid path is found, we return the accumulated ratio; otherwise, we return `-1`.

### 📈 Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Constructing the graph takes `O(E)`, where `E` is the number of equations (edges).
   
2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the DFS might visit all nodes and edges in the graph. Hence, for each query, the time complexity is `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of variables (nodes) and `E` is the number of edges.
   
3. **Overall Complexity**:
   - For `Q` queries, the overall complexity is `O(Q * (V + E))`.

#### Space Complexity:
1. **Graph Storage**:
   - The space complexity for the graph is `O(V + E)` where `V` is the number of variables and `E` is the number of edges.

2. **DFS Stack**:
   - The DFS recursion stack depth is at most `O(V)`, leading to a space complexity of `O(V)` for the DFS.

Thus, the overall space complexity is `O(V + E)`.

### 🏁 Conclusion

This solution effectively solves the problem of evaluating division queries using a graph traversal technique. By representing the equations as a graph and using DFS, we can find paths between variables and calculate their ratios. The algorithm is efficient and works well even for large inputs, with time complexity of `O(Q * (V + E))` and space complexity of `O(V + E)`.

✨ **Tip**: With this approach, you're not just solving queries—you're mastering graph traversal! Keep practicing, and these concepts will become second nature!
