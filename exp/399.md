### Problem Statement
You are given a list of equations and their corresponding values, and you need to evaluate queries based on these equations. Each equation is represented as a pair of strings (e.g., `["a", "b"]`), and the value represents the ratio (e.g., `a / b = value`). Your task is to calculate the results of a series of queries where each query is also a pair of strings.

### Approach
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use a graph to represent the relationships between variables. Each variable is a node, and the edges represent the ratios between them.
   - For each equation `["a", "b"]` with a value `k`, create directed edges: 
     - From `a` to `b` with weight `k` (representing `a / b = k`)
     - From `b` to `a` with weight `1/k` (representing `b / a = 1/k`), but only if `k` is not zero.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - For each query `["c", "d"]`, perform a DFS starting from `c` to find `d`.
   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and ensure that each variable is only processed once during the search.

3. **Results Collection**:
   - If the target variable is found, return the computed ratio; otherwise, return -1 to indicate that the value cannot be determined.

### Code Walk-through
- The `calcEquation` function initializes a graph and processes the input equations to build the relationships.
- For each query, it initializes a set to keep track of visited variables and calls the `dfs` function to attempt to compute the ratio.
- The `dfs` function recursively explores the graph, multiplying the weights along the path until it finds the target variable.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) for constructing the graph and O(Q * (V + E)) for processing the queries, where V is the number of unique variables and E is the number of equations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E) to store the graph.
