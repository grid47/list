### Problem Statement

Given a list of equations, each in the form `A / B = value`, and a list of queries, the task is to evaluate the result of each query in the form `A / B` using the given equations. For each query, we are to find the result of the division, if possible, or return `-1` if it is not possible to evaluate the expression. The equations can be considered as undirected edges in a graph where the nodes represent variables (e.g., `A`, `B`, etc.), and the values on the edges represent the ratio between those variables.

### Approach

This problem is a variant of the "graph traversal" problem, where:
1. Each variable represents a node.
2. Each equation represents an edge with a weight corresponding to the division ratio.
3. The task is to find a path between two nodes that satisfies the ratio specified by the query.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Graph Representation**: Use a graph to represent the variables and their relationships. The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where each node (variable) points to other nodes (variables it is related to) along with the ratio.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: For each query, perform a DFS starting from the numerator of the query variable, and try to find a path to the denominator. While traversing, we accumulate the ratios of the edges.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: If there is no valid path between the numerator and denominator, return `-1`. If the query is between the same variable (i.e., `A / A`), return `1` if it exists in the graph, otherwise return `-1`.

#### Process:
1. **Graph Construction**: Build a graph where each equation adds two directed edges representing the relationship `A / B = value` and `B / A = 1 / value`.
2. **DFS Traversal**: For each query, start DFS from the numerator to the denominator, accumulating the product of edge weights along the way. If there is no path, return `-1`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Graph Construction

```cpp
map<string, vector<pair<string, double>>> graph;

for (int i = 0; i < eqn.size(); i++) {
    double w = val[i];
    graph[eqn[i][0]].push_back(make_pair(eqn[i][1], w));
    if (w == 0) continue;
    graph[eqn[i][1]].push_back(make_pair(eqn[i][0], 1 / w));
}
```
- A graph is built using an adjacency list, where each node (`string` type) points to other nodes along with the division ratio (`double` type).
- For each equation `A / B = value`, two directed edges are added:
  - One from `A` to `B` with weight `value`.
  - One from `B` to `A` with weight `1 / value`.
- The loop iterates through all equations, and the graph is populated accordingly.

#### Step 2: Query Processing

```cpp
vector<double> ans;

for (int i = 0; i < q.size(); i++) {
    set<string> vis;
    double res = dfs(q[i][0], q[i][1], vis, graph);
    if (res < 0) res = -1;
    ans.push_back(res);
}
```
- After constructing the graph, we process each query by calling the DFS function for each pair `A / B` in the query.
- We maintain a set `vis` to track visited nodes during the DFS to avoid cycles and repeated visits.
- The result of each query is pushed to the `ans` vector.

#### Step 3: Depth-First Search (DFS)

```cpp
double dfs(string start, string end, set<string> &vis, map<string, vector<pair<string, double>>> &gph) {
    if (start == end) return gph.count(start) ? 1 : -1;
    vis.insert(start);
    double ans = -1;
    for (pair<string, double> x : gph[start]) {
        if (vis.count(x.first)) continue;
        
        double res = x.second * dfs(x.first, end, vis, gph);
        if (res < 0) continue;
        return res;
    }
    return ans;
}
```
- The DFS function is designed to search for a path between the `start` (numerator) and `end` (denominator) variables in the graph.
- **Base Case**: If the `start` variable equals the `end` variable, return `1` if the node exists in the graph. Otherwise, return `-1`.
- **DFS Traversal**: For each adjacent node to `start`, the DFS is recursively called. The product of the current edge weight (`x.second`) is multiplied by the result of the recursive DFS call.
- **Cycle Avoidance**: To prevent cycles, we use the `vis` set to track visited nodes during the search.
- If a valid path is found, the accumulated product of edge weights is returned. If no valid path exists, `-1` is returned.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
1. **Graph Construction**: 
   - Constructing the graph involves iterating over the list of equations (`eqn`). Each equation requires inserting two directed edges in the graph. Thus, the graph construction takes `O(E)`, where `E` is the number of equations.
   
2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, we perform a DFS traversal. In the worst case, the DFS can visit all nodes and edges in the graph. The complexity of DFS for each query is `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of unique variables (nodes) and `E` is the number of edges in the graph.
   - Therefore, the overall complexity for processing all queries is `O(Q * (V + E))`, where `Q` is the number of queries.

#### Space Complexity:
1. **Graph Storage**: 
   - The space complexity for storing the graph is `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of unique variables and `E` is the number of equations (edges).
   
2. **DFS Stack**: 
   - In the worst case, the DFS recursion stack can have a depth of `V`, so the space complexity for the recursion stack is `O(V)`.

Thus, the overall space complexity is `O(V + E)`.

### Conclusion

The solution efficiently solves the problem of evaluating division queries using graph traversal. The key idea is to represent the variables and equations as a graph and then use depth-first search (DFS) to find paths between the queried variables. The graph is built in `O(E)`, and each query is processed in `O(V + E)` time, ensuring that the solution works well even for larger inputs. The use of DFS ensures that we can correctly handle the paths between variables while avoiding cycles. The space complexity is also optimal, making this solution both time-efficient and space-efficient.
