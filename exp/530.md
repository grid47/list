### Problem Statement
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two nodes in the tree.

### Approach
1. **Inorder Traversal**: Since a BST is ordered, performing an inorder traversal yields the values in sorted order. This allows us to easily find the minimum difference between consecutive nodes.

2. **Tracking Previous Node**: Use a variable `prv` to keep track of the previous node during the traversal. This helps in calculating the difference between the current node and the previous node.

3. **Using a Stack**: Utilize a stack to implement an iterative inorder traversal:
   - Traverse the left subtree until you reach the leftmost node, pushing all nodes onto the stack.
   - Pop nodes from the stack to visit them, check the difference between the current node and the previous node, and update the minimum difference accordingly.
   - Move to the right subtree after visiting a node.

### Code Walk-through
- Initialize `prv` to `NULL` and `ans` to `INT_MAX`.
- Use a stack to perform the inorder traversal iteratively.
- For each visited node, calculate the difference with the `prv` node if `prv` is not `NULL`, and update `ans` with the minimum difference found.
- Finally, return the minimum difference.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the stack used for the traversal. In the worst case (a skewed tree), this can be O(n).
