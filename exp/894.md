## Problem Statement
The problem involves generating all possible full binary trees (FBTs) with `n` nodes. A full binary tree is defined as a binary tree where each node has either 0 or 2 children.

## Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Use a vector of vectors `dp` where `dp[i]` stores all possible FBTs with `i` nodes.
2. **Base Case**: Initialize `dp[1]` with a single node tree.
3. **Building Trees**: For every odd number of nodes `i` from 3 to `n`:
   - Split `i` into left and right subtrees by choosing odd sizes for the left subtree `l` (from 1 to `i - 2`).
   - For each left subtree in `dp[l]` and each right subtree in `dp[i - l - 1]`, create a new root node with these subtrees as children.
   - Store the constructed tree in `dp[i]`.

## Code Walk-through
- The code defines a method `allPossibleFBT` which takes an integer `n` as input.
- A 2D vector `dp` is initialized, where `dp[i]` will contain all full binary trees with `i` nodes.
- `dp[1]` is populated with a single `TreeNode` (the base case).
- For odd numbers from 3 to `n`, the code loops over possible sizes for the left subtree:
  - For each combination of left and right subtree sizes, a new tree is created with a new root and the respective left and right children.
- Finally, the function returns all possible FBTs with `n` nodes stored in `dp[n]`.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^3), as constructing trees involves nested loops over `n`, and for each pair of subtrees, a new tree node is created.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes since each valid tree is stored in the `dp` array.
