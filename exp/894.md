### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to generate all **possible full binary trees (FBT)** with `n` nodes, where `n` is an odd number. A full binary tree is defined as a binary tree where every node has either **two children** (both left and right) or **no children** (i.e., it is a leaf node). For this problem, we need to return a list of all distinct full binary trees that can be constructed with exactly `n` nodes.

A full binary tree must always have an odd number of nodes, and every non-leaf node must have exactly two children. We are tasked with finding all possible full binary trees with `n` nodes.

### Approach

The approach to solve this problem involves utilizing **dynamic programming (DP)**. We will iteratively build the full binary trees for smaller numbers of nodes and use these to construct larger trees.

#### Key Insights:
1. **Base Case**: The simplest full binary tree is a tree with just one node, i.e., a single root node with no children. This is the only configuration for `n = 1`, and we initialize this base case with a tree containing only the root node.
  
2. **Recursive Construction**: For any odd number `n`, a full binary tree can be constructed by combining two smaller full binary trees:
   - The left subtree will have `l` nodes, and the right subtree will have `n - l - 1` nodes. Both `l` and `n - l - 1` must be odd numbers since a full binary tree with an even number of nodes is not possible.
   - For each combination of left and right subtrees, we create a new root node, with the left and right subtrees as its children.

3. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**:
   - We maintain a DP array `dp[i]` where `dp[i]` holds a list of all possible full binary trees with `i` nodes.
   - For each odd number `i` (starting from 3 and incrementing by 2), we generate all full binary trees by combining smaller trees from previously computed values in `dp`.

4. **Combinations of Subtrees**:
   - For each number `l` of nodes in the left subtree, the right subtree will contain `n - l - 1` nodes. We combine every tree in `dp[l]` with every tree in `dp[n - l - 1]` and create a new tree with these two subtrees as children of a new root node.

5. **Return the Final Result**: After filling the DP array, the result for `n` nodes will be stored in `dp[n]`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Initialize DP Array**:
   ```cpp
   vector<vector<TreeNode*>> dp(n + 1);
   dp[1].push_back(new TreeNode(0));  // Base case: only one node in the tree.
   ```
   - We create a DP array `dp` with `n + 1` elements, where each element is a vector of `TreeNode*`. The first element, `dp[1]`, contains one tree with just a single node.

2. **Iterating Over Odd Numbers (i)**:
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 3; i <= n; i += 2) {
   ```
   - The outer loop starts from `i = 3` and increments by 2, considering only odd values of `i`. We build full binary trees for each odd `i`.

3. **Generating Combinations of Left and Right Subtrees**:
   ```cpp
   for (int l = 1; l < i; l += 2) {
       for (auto it : dp[l]) {
           for (auto it2 : dp[i - l - 1]) {
               TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(0);
               node->left = it;
               node->right = it2;
               dp[i].push_back(node);
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   - For each value of `l`, we consider all pairs of left and right subtrees. The left subtree has `l` nodes, and the right subtree has `i - l - 1` nodes.
   - We then create a new root node, assign the left and right subtrees to it, and push this new tree into `dp[i]`.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return dp[n];
   ```
   - Finally, we return the list of all possible full binary trees for `n` nodes, which is stored in `dp[n]`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = n`, and it iterates with a step size of 2, which means it runs approximately `n/2` times.
- **Inner Loops**: For each value of `i`, the inner loops iterate over all combinations of `l` (where `l` is odd and less than `i`). For each pair of `l` and `n - l - 1`, we combine all trees from `dp[l]` and `dp[n - l - 1]`. The number of trees in `dp[l]` and `dp[n - l - 1]` grows exponentially with `l` and `n`.
  - The total number of operations in the worst case is roughly the **number of possible full binary trees** up to `n`, which follows the structure of **Catalan numbers**. The Catalan number for `n` is approximately `O(4^n / n^(3/2))`.
  - Therefore, the time complexity of this approach is **O(4^n / n^(3/2))**.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is dominated by the storage of the trees in `dp[i]`. Since each tree is represented as a `TreeNode` object and there are at most **Catalan number** of trees for each `i`, the space complexity is **O(4^n / n^(3/2))**, similar to the time complexity.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes all possible full binary trees for a given number `n` using dynamic programming. By constructing trees recursively from smaller subproblems, the solution avoids the inefficiencies of brute force tree generation. Although the time and space complexities grow exponentially with `n`, the algorithm leverages the properties of full binary trees and dynamic programming to handle the problem in a more optimized way compared to generating every tree individually. The approach works efficiently for smaller values of `n` and provides a clear and methodical way to generate all full binary trees.
