### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to determine the minimum cost of painting `m` houses with `n` different colors such that exactly `target` neighborhoods are formed. A neighborhood is defined as a group of adjacent houses painted the same color. If a house is already painted (indicated by a non-zero value in the input array), we cannot change its color. The goal is to minimize the cost associated with painting the houses while adhering to the conditions regarding neighborhoods.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can utilize dynamic programming with memoization. The idea is to recursively compute the minimum cost for painting houses, taking into account the current house index, the color of the previous house, and the number of neighborhoods still required. We use a recursive function that explores different color options for each house, tracking the cost and the neighborhoods formed.

The steps for our approach are as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Store the input parameters in class variables. Create a 3D memoization table (`mem`) to cache results and avoid redundant calculations.

2. **Recursive Function**: Define a recursive function `dp` that takes the current house index, the color of the previous house, and the remaining neighborhoods. The base cases are:
   - If all houses are processed and exactly zero neighborhoods are left, return a cost of zero.
   - If we run out of houses or need fewer neighborhoods than possible, return infinity (impossible case).

3. **Calculate Costs**: For each house, depending on whether it is already painted:
   - If painted, check the previous color and decide whether to count this as a new neighborhood or continue with the current one.
   - If unpainted, try all colors and calculate the associated costs.

4. **Memoization**: Store the computed result in the `mem` table to ensure efficient retrieval for overlapping subproblems.

5. **Final Result**: After completing the recursive calculations, check the result for the initial conditions and return the appropriate value.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here is the breakdown of the provided code:

1. **Class Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
   ```
   - The `Solution` class is defined to encapsulate the problem-solving logic.

2. **Member Variables**:
   ```cpp
   int m, n;
   vector<vector<int>> cost;
   vector<int> houses;
   vector<vector<vector<int>>> mem;
   ```
   - Member variables are declared to hold:
     - `m`: Number of houses.
     - `n`: Number of colors.
     - `cost`: Cost of painting each house with each color.
     - `houses`: Array indicating the initial paint state of the houses.
     - `mem`: 3D memoization table to cache results.

3. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
   int minCost(vector<int>& houses, vector<vector<int>>& cost, int m, int n, int target) {
       this->m = m;
       this->n = n;
       this->houses = houses;
       this->cost = cost;
       mem.resize(m + 1, vector<vector<int>>(n + 3, vector<int>(m + 1, -1)));
       int ans = dp(0, -1, target);
       return ans >= INT_MAX? -1: ans;
   }
   ```
   - The `minCost` function initializes the member variables and the memoization table. It calls the recursive `dp` function starting from the first house, with no previous color and the target number of neighborhoods. It returns the final computed answer, converting infinity to `-1` for impossible cases.

4. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   ```cpp
   long dp(int idx, int prv, int tgt) {
   ```
   - The `dp` function implements the recursive logic:
     - **Base Cases**:
       - If all houses are processed (`idx == m`) and `tgt == 0`, return `0`.
       - If `tgt < 0` or we reach the end of houses without satisfying the target, return `INT_MAX`.
     - **Memoization Check**:
       ```cpp
       if(mem[idx][prv + 1][tgt] != -1) return mem[idx][prv + 1][tgt];
       ```
       - If the result for the current state is already computed, return the cached value.
     - **Cost Calculation**:
       - If the house is painted:
         - Compare the previous color with the current house color and decide the cost.
       - If the house is unpainted:
         - Iterate through all available colors and calculate the minimum cost for each.

5. **Return Statement**:
   ```cpp
   return mem[idx][prv + 1][tgt] = res;
   ```
   - The computed minimum cost for the current state is stored in the `mem` table for future reference.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this approach is \(O(m \cdot n \cdot m)\) because we explore each house and for each house, we consider all colors and potential neighborhoods, leading to \(m \cdot n\) combinations for memoization.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(m \cdot n \cdot m)\) due to the memoization table storing results for each combination of house indices, previous colors, and target neighborhoods.

### Conclusion

The provided implementation of the `minCost` function is an efficient solution to the problem of minimizing the painting cost of houses while maintaining a specific number of neighborhoods. Key highlights of the solution include:

1. **Dynamic Programming**: The use of dynamic programming and memoization effectively reduces the computational burden by storing intermediate results, allowing for quick retrieval of previously calculated states.

2. **Flexibility**: The solution handles various scenarios, including houses that are already painted and different color options, making it robust for diverse inputs.

3. **Scalability**: Given the constraints on the number of houses and colors, the approach can handle larger datasets within reasonable time limits due to its polynomial complexity.

This method not only showcases an effective problem-solving strategy for dynamic programming but also illustrates how to manage state transitions in a recursive environment efficiently. Overall, this solution serves as an exemplary reference for similar problems in competitive programming and algorithm design.
