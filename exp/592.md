### Problem Statement
Given a string representing a list of fractions, return a string representing their sum in reduced form. The input format is "a/b", where `a` is the numerator and `b` is the denominator.

### Approach
1. **Parsing the Expression**:
   - Use `istringstream` to read the string expression token by token. Each token consists of a numerator and a denominator separated by a '/' character.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `A` as the numerator of the result and `B` as the common denominator, starting with `A = 0` and `B = 1` to represent the fraction `0/1`.

3. **Processing Each Fraction**:
   - For each fraction parsed, update the total numerator and denominator:
     - Update the numerator: \( A = A \cdot b + a \cdot B \)
     - Update the denominator: \( B = B \cdot b \)
   - This essentially combines the two fractions into a single fraction.

4. **Reduction**:
   - After processing all fractions, reduce the resulting fraction:
     - Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `A` and `B` and divide both by the GCD to ensure the result is in the simplest form.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Convert the final numerator and denominator into a string format "A/B" and return it.

### Code Walk-through
- The main function `fractionAddition` utilizes a loop to read and process each fraction from the input string.
- Intermediate calculations and reductions are performed, and debugging output is printed to trace values during execution.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the input string, as we need to parse through each character.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), not counting the input string storage since we use a fixed amount of extra space for storing numerators and denominators.
