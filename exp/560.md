### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals `k`.

### Approach
1. **Prefix Sum and HashMap**:
   - Use a hash map (`unordered_map`) to store the cumulative sum (prefix sum) encountered so far and their respective counts.
   - Initialize the hash map with the key `0` set to `1`, which accounts for the case where a subarray sum equals `k` starting from the beginning of the array.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - For each element in the array, update the cumulative sum.
   - Check if the difference between the current cumulative sum and `k` exists in the hash map. If it does, it indicates the presence of a subarray that sums to `k`, and you increment the count accordingly.
   - Update the hash map with the current cumulative sum.

### Code Walk-through
- The function `subarraySum` initializes the result counter `res` and the hash map `mp`.
- As it iterates through `nums`, it maintains a running sum and checks for previous sums that would form a subarray summing to `k`.
- Finally, the function returns the count of such subarrays.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. Each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, for storing the prefix sums in the hash map.
