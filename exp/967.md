### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to generate all numbers of `n` digits that have the same absolute difference `k` between every two consecutive digits. Specifically, we are given two inputs:
1. `n`: The number of digits in the desired numbers.
2. `k`: The absolute difference between every two consecutive digits.

Our task is to return a list of all such `n`-digit numbers that satisfy the condition. The digits of each number should follow the condition that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is exactly `k`. For example, if `k = 2`, then the number `202` satisfies the condition because the absolute difference between consecutive digits (`|2-0| = 2` and `|0-2| = 2`) is `2`.

### Approach

We can solve this problem efficiently by building the numbers digit by digit. Let's break down the process:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We start with all one-digit numbers between `1` and `9` because we are interested in valid `n`-digit numbers, and a valid number cannot start with `0`.

2. **Iterative Construction**:
   - For each subsequent digit, we check if it is valid based on the previous digit. Specifically, if the current number ends with a digit `y`, we can append a new digit to it by ensuring the absolute difference between the current and the new digit is exactly `k`.
   - We calculate the possible new digits by adding `k` to `y` or subtracting `k` from `y`, provided these new digits are within the valid range (`0` to `9`).

3. **Loop Over Digits**:
   - The process is repeated until we reach `n` digits. Each time we add a digit, we generate all possible numbers from the current list of valid numbers.

4. **Final Output**:
   - Once we have built all valid numbers of `n` digits, we return the list of those numbers.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> numsSameConsecDiff(int n, int k) {
        vector<int> cur = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - We start by initializing a vector `cur` containing all one-digit numbers from `1` to `9`. These are the potential starting points for the numbers we will construct. This step ensures we don’t consider numbers starting with `0` (which is invalid for `n`-digit numbers).

```cpp
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            vector<int> cur2;
```

2. **Loop Over Number Length**:
   - We begin a loop that will run from `i = 2` to `i = n`. In each iteration, we will extend the numbers in the current list `cur` to the next number, ensuring that they still satisfy the condition of having consecutive digits with the absolute difference `k`.

   - `cur2` is the new list that will store all the valid numbers that can be generated from the current `cur`.

```cpp
            for(int x: cur) {
                int y = x % 10;
```

3. **Iterating Over Current Numbers**:
   - We iterate over each number `x` in the current list `cur`. For each number, we extract the last digit `y` by calculating `x % 10`. This will help us determine the next digit to append to `x`.

```cpp
                if(y + k < 10)
                    cur2.push_back(x * 10 + y + k);
                if(k > 0 && y - k >= 0)
                    cur2.push_back(x * 10 + y - k);
```

4. **Generating Next Digits**:
   - **Adding `k`**: If the digit `y + k` is less than `10`, we append this digit to `x` to form a new number. This means we are generating a valid number by adding `k` to the last digit of `x`.
   - **Subtracting `k`**: If `k > 0` and `y - k` is greater than or equal to `0`, we append this digit to `x` to form another valid number by subtracting `k` from the last digit of `x`. The condition `k > 0` ensures we don’t generate invalid numbers when `k = 0`.

```cpp
            cur = cur2;
        }
```

5. **Updating `cur`**:
   - After processing all numbers in the current `cur`, we assign `cur2` back to `cur`. This means that in the next iteration, we will work with the new list of numbers that are one digit longer.

```cpp
        return cur;
    }
};
```

6. **Return Final Result**:
   - Once the loop ends, `cur` contains all the valid numbers that have exactly `n` digits, and we return this list as the final result.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The time complexity is **O(n * 9 * 2^(n-1))**, where:
    - `n` is the number of digits.
    - The factor `9 * 2^(n-1)` represents the potential number of valid numbers that need to be generated for each `n`. For each number, at most two new digits can be appended (either by adding or subtracting `k`), and there are at most 9 starting digits.
  
  The complexity grows exponentially with `n`, but since each number is only evaluated once in each iteration, this approach is efficient for typical constraints.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is **O(9 * 2^n)** because we need to store the list of valid numbers in each iteration, which can grow exponentially.

### Conclusion

This solution provides an efficient approach to solving the problem of generating `n`-digit numbers where the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is exactly `k`. The algorithm generates these numbers by building them iteratively, ensuring that we maintain the desired difference between consecutive digits at each step. This approach is highly efficient in terms of time complexity, as it avoids redundant checks and directly generates valid numbers. The space complexity is manageable for typical input sizes, and the solution is designed to scale well with the input constraints.
