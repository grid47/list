## Problem Statement
Generate all `n`-digit integers where each pair of consecutive digits has a difference of `k`. The resulting numbers should not contain any leading zeroes.

## Approach
1. **Initial Digits**: Start with the digits 1 through 9 as the initial list (`cur`) because the first digit cannot be zero.
2. **Build Numbers Iteratively**:
   - For each iteration from 2 to `n` (representing the number of digits in the result):
     - Create a new vector `cur2` to store the updated numbers.
     - For each number `x` in `cur`:
       - Get the last digit `y` of `x`.
       - **Add Consecutive Digit**: If `y + k` is a valid digit (less than 10), append `y + k` to `x` and store the result in `cur2`.
       - **Subtract Consecutive Digit**: If `k > 0` and `y - k` is valid (greater than or equal to 0), append `y - k` to `x` and store the result in `cur2`.
     - Replace `cur` with `cur2` to continue building the next digit level.
3. **Return**: After `n` iterations, `cur` will contain all `n`-digit numbers that meet the criteria.

## Code Walk-through
- The function `numsSameConsecDiff` takes two integers, `n` and `k`, as inputs.
- **Initialization**:
  - Start with all one-digit numbers from 1 to 9 in `cur`.
- **Digit Addition**:
  - For each digit level from 2 to `n`:
    - Iterate over each number in `cur`.
    - Calculate the next possible digits by adding or subtracting `k` from the last digit.
    - Append these valid digits to form new numbers in `cur2`.
  - Update `cur` with `cur2` for the next iteration.
- After building all `n`-digit numbers, return `cur`.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n), as each digit level potentially doubles the number of possibilities (adding or subtracting `k`).
- **Space Complexity**: O(2^n), for storing possible numbers at each level.

This solution efficiently builds all valid numbers by only considering possible next digits, reducing unnecessary computations.
