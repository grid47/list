### Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` matrix `heights` representing the elevation of each cell in a grid, find all the coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Water can flow from a cell to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, right) if the adjacent cell's elevation is equal to or lower than the current cell's elevation.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: Create two boolean matrices `pac` and `atl` to keep track of which cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, respectively. 
2. **DFS Traversal**: 
   - Perform Depth First Search (DFS) from the borders of the grid:
     - For the Pacific Ocean, start from the top row (row 0) and the left column (column 0).
     - For the Atlantic Ocean, start from the bottom row (row `m - 1`) and the right column (column `n - 1`).
3. **Check Flow Conditions**: During the DFS, mark a cell as visited if it can flow to the respective ocean. From each cell, check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to see if the water can flow based on the elevation condition.
4. **Collect Results**: After completing the DFS for both oceans, iterate through the matrices `pac` and `atl` to collect the coordinates of the cells that can flow to both oceans.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Input Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the `heights` matrix.
2. **Initialize Visited Matrices**: Create two `m x n` matrices to track visited cells for both oceans.
3. **DFS Calls**: Call the `dfs` function for the borders corresponding to both oceans.
4. **Final Result Compilation**: Create a result vector and add the coordinates of cells that can flow to both oceans based on the boolean matrices.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. Each cell is visited a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the boolean matrices and the recursion stack in the DFS.
