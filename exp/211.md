### Problem Statement
You need to implement a `WordDictionary` class that supports adding words and searching for words in a way that allows for the use of the wildcard character `.` which can represent any letter.

### Approach
1. **Trie Structure**: Use a trie (prefix tree) to store the words. Each node represents a character in a word.
   - Each node has:
     - A `val` for the character it represents.
     - A `bool isWord` to indicate if the node marks the end of a valid word.
     - A `next` vector that contains pointers to the next characters (children nodes).

2. **Adding Words**:
   - For each character in the word, traverse down the trie. If the character node does not exist, create a new node. Mark the end of the word once the last character is inserted.

3. **Searching for Words**:
   - Implement a recursive function (`bt`) to handle searches. If a character is `.`, recursively search all possible branches of the trie at that position. If a specific character is encountered, follow the respective branch.

### Code Walk-through
- **Node Class**:
  - Represents a single character in the trie with children and a flag indicating if it's the end of a word.

- **WordDictionary Class**:
  - **Constructor**: Initializes the root of the trie.
  - **addWord**: Iterates through the word characters, inserting them into the trie.
  - **search**: Calls the recursive `bt` function to search for the word.
  - **bt Function**:
    - Checks for the current character:
      - If it’s `.`, explore all children nodes.
      - If it’s a specific character, navigate to the corresponding child.
    - Determines if the end of a word has been reached.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **addWord**: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of the word being added.
  - **search**: \(O(m \cdot 26^d)\) in the worst case, where \(d\) is the number of wildcards in the word (exploring all branches).

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \cdot n)\), where \(m\) is the average length of the words stored and \(n\) is the number of words, due to the trie structure.
