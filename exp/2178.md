### Problem Statement

The problem asks to split a given sum into a series of distinct even numbers. The task is to find the largest set of even integers whose sum equals the given `sum`. Additionally, if it is not possible to split the sum into distinct even numbers, return an empty list.

### Approach

This problem can be approached by iterating through even numbers starting from 2 and subtracting them from the `sum`. We continue this until we can no longer subtract the next even number. If there is any remaining sum left that cannot be used to form a valid distinct even number, we adjust the last number in the sequence to account for the remaining sum.

The key observation is that:
- Only even sums can be split into distinct even numbers.
- The even numbers need to be distinct and should add up to the given `sum`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Function Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   vector<long long> maximumEvenSplit(long long sum) {
   ```
   - The function `maximumEvenSplit` is defined to return a vector of `long long` integers. It takes a `long long` number `sum` as input.

2. **Check for Odd Sum**:
   ```cpp
   if(sum % 2 == 1) return ans;
   ```
   - The first check verifies if the sum is odd (`sum % 2 == 1`).
   - If the sum is odd, it is impossible to split it into distinct even numbers because the sum of even numbers is always even.
   - In this case, we return an empty vector `ans`, which is initialized at the beginning.

3. **Initialize Variables**:
   ```cpp
   int cur = 2;
   ```
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `2`, the smallest even number. This will represent the current even number being considered in the sequence.

4. **Loop to Subtract Even Numbers**:
   ```cpp
   while(sum >= cur) {
       ans.push_back(cur);
       sum -= cur;
       cur += 2;
   }
   ```
   - The `while` loop continues as long as `sum` is greater than or equal to `cur`. This ensures that we can keep subtracting even numbers from `sum`.
   - In each iteration, the current even number (`cur`) is added to the result vector `ans`.
   - The value of `sum` is reduced by `cur` and then `cur` is incremented by 2 to move to the next even number (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.).

5. **Handle Remaining Sum**:
   ```cpp
   if(sum > 0) ans[ans.size() - 1] += sum;
   ```
   - After the loop ends, if there is any remaining `sum` greater than zero, it means that we cannot form another distinct even number.
   - In this case, we adjust the last number in the vector by adding the remaining `sum` to it.
   - This ensures that the total sum of the elements in the vector is equal to the original `sum`, while keeping the numbers distinct and even.

6. **Return the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return ans;
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns the vector `ans`, which contains the distinct even numbers whose sum is equal to the original `sum`.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1: `sum = 10`
- **Step 1**: Check if `sum` is odd. Since `10 % 2 == 0`, we proceed.
- **Step 2**: Initialize `cur = 2`.
- **Step 3**: Subtract `2` from `10`, resulting in a sum of `8`. Add `2` to the result vector: `ans = {2}`. Increment `cur` to `4`.
- **Step 4**: Subtract `4` from `8`, resulting in a sum of `4`. Add `4` to the result vector: `ans = {2, 4}`. Increment `cur` to `6`.
- **Step 5**: Subtract `6` from `4`, resulting in a sum of `-2`. Since the sum is less than `cur`, the loop terminates.
- **Step 6**: Adjust the last number: the remaining sum is `4`. Add this to the last element (`4`), resulting in `ans = {2, 8}`.
- **Step 7**: Return `ans = {2, 8}`.

#### Example 2: `sum = 11`
- **Step 1**: Check if `sum` is odd. Since `11 % 2 == 1`, return an empty vector: `[]`.

#### Example 3: `sum = 16`
- **Step 1**: Check if `sum` is odd. Since `16 % 2 == 0`, we proceed.
- **Step 2**: Initialize `cur = 2`.
- **Step 3**: Subtract `2` from `16`, resulting in a sum of `14`. Add `2` to the result vector: `ans = {2}`. Increment `cur` to `4`.
- **Step 4**: Subtract `4` from `14`, resulting in a sum of `10`. Add `4` to the result vector: `ans = {2, 4}`. Increment `cur` to `6`.
- **Step 5**: Subtract `6` from `10`, resulting in a sum of `4`. Add `6` to the result vector: `ans = {2, 4, 6}`. Increment `cur` to `8`.
- **Step 6**: Subtract `8` from `4`, resulting in a sum of `-4`. The loop terminates.
- **Step 7**: Adjust the last number by adding the remaining sum (`4`) to the last element, resulting in `ans = {2, 4, 10}`.
- **Step 8**: Return `ans = {2, 4, 10}`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of even numbers that can be added to the vector. In the worst case, the loop runs `n` times, where `n` is proportional to the size of the input `sum`. Each iteration involves constant-time operations such as pushing to the vector, subtraction, and incrementing `cur`.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of even numbers added to the result vector. The space used is proportional to the number of even numbers included in the solution, which can be at most `sum / 2`.

### Conclusion

The solution efficiently solves the problem of splitting a given sum into distinct even numbers. By leveraging the properties of even numbers and iterating through them in increasing order, the solution minimizes the number of operations required. The algorithm ensures that the sum of the even numbers is equal to the original sum, and adjusts the last number if necessary. This solution is optimal in terms of both time and space complexity, making it a robust approach for large sums.
