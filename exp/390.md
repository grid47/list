### Problem Statement
You are tasked with finding the last remaining number in a list of integers from 1 to n after repeatedly removing every second number in a circular manner. 

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: Start with the first number as the head of the sequence. Use flags and variables to keep track of the direction of removal (`left`), the number of remaining elements (`rm`), the step size for removal, and the current head value.

2. **Iterative Removal**: While there is more than one number remaining:
   - If removing from the left or if the remaining count is odd, update the head by adding the current step size.
   - Halve the count of remaining numbers.
   - Double the step size for the next iteration.
   - Toggle the direction for the next round.

3. **Return the Result**: Once only one number remains, return the head value, which represents the last remaining number.

### Code Walk-through
- The function uses a loop to simulate the removal process efficiently, adjusting the head and remaining numbers based on the current direction.
- By alternating the direction and adjusting the step size accordingly, it ensures an optimal approach without requiring additional data structures to simulate the removal of elements.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), where n is the initial count of numbers, as the number of remaining numbers is halved in each iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only a constant amount of space is used for variables regardless of the input size.
