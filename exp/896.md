### Problem Statement
Given an array `A`, determine if it is monotonic. An array is monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing.

### Approach
1. **Flags**:
   - Use two boolean flags, `inc` and `dec`, to track if the array is non-decreasing and non-increasing, respectively.

2. **Iterate through the Array**:
   - Loop through the array starting from the second element.
   - Update the `inc` flag to check if the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element.
   - Update the `dec` flag to check if the current element is less than or equal to the previous element.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return `true` if either `inc` or `dec` remains `true` after the loop, indicating that the array is monotonic.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to check monotonicity.
    - `bool isMonotonic(vector<int> A)`: Checks if the array is monotonic.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array (single pass).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since only a fixed number of additional variables are used.
