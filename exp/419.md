### Problem Statement
Given a 2D board represented as a grid of characters where 'X' represents part of a battleship and '.' represents water, count the number of distinct battleships. A battleship is made up of one or more contiguous 'X's that are placed horizontally or vertically. There are no diagonal battleships, and each battleship is guaranteed to be separated by at least one cell of water.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: Check if the board is empty. If it is, return 0.
2. **Iterate Through the Board**: Loop through each cell in the grid:
   - For each cell containing 'X':
     - Check if it is the first 'X' in its battleship:
       - It is the first 'X' if either it is in the first row or the cell directly above it is not 'X'.
       - It is also the first 'X' if it is in the first column or the cell to the left is not 'X'.
3. **Count Distinct Battleships**: If both conditions are satisfied, increment the battleship count.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Board Size**: Determine the dimensions of the board with `m` and `n`.
2. **Nested Loops**: Use nested loops to iterate through each cell in the board.
3. **Counting Logic**: Inside the nested loops, apply the conditions to check if the current 'X' is the start of a new battleship, and update the count accordingly.
4. **Return Result**: Finally, return the count of distinct battleships.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. Each cell is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional data structures are used that grow with the input size.
