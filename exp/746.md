### Problem Statement
You are given an array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of stepping on the `i`-th stair. You can either start from the 0-th stair or the 1-st stair and your goal is to reach the top of the floor, which is one step beyond the last stair. Each time you can either step on the next stair or jump over one stair. Calculate the minimum cost to reach the top of the stairs.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming Array**:
   - Create a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach the `i-th` stair.
   - Initialize `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` to `0`, as there is no cost to start on either of the first two stairs.

2. **Fill the DP Array**:
   - Iterate from the 2nd stair to the last stair (`n`).
   - For each stair, calculate the minimum cost to reach it by considering the last two stairs:
     - `dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + cost[i-1], dp[i-2] + cost[i-2])`

3. **Return Result**:
   - The result will be found in `dp[n]`, which gives the minimum cost to reach the top of the stairs.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to compute the minimum cost to climb the stairs.

- **Method**:
  - `int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost)`: Implements the logic to calculate and return the minimum climbing cost.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of stairs (length of the `cost` array).
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), due to the use of the `dp` array to store the minimum costs.
