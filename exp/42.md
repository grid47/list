### Problem Statement
The task is to compute how much water can be trapped after raining, given an array representing the height of bars in a histogram.

### Approach
1. **Two-Pointer Technique**: 
   - Use two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to traverse the array from both ends towards the center.
   - Maintain two variables `ml` and `mr` to store the maximum heights encountered from the left and right sides, respectively.

2. **Water Trapping Logic**:
   - If the height at the left pointer (`n[l]`) is less than the height at the right pointer (`n[r]`), it indicates that the left side can potentially trap water.
     - Calculate the water trapped at the left position as the difference between `ml` (maximum height from the left) and the current height `n[l]`. 
     - Update `ml` to be the maximum of the current height and the previously recorded maximum.
     - Move the left pointer to the right.
   - Conversely, if `n[r]` is less than or equal to `n[l]`, calculate the trapped water on the right side similarly and move the right pointer to the left.

3. **Continue Until Pointers Meet**:
   - The process continues until the two pointers meet, at which point all potential water traps have been accounted for.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Set up pointers `l` and `r`, and initialize `ans` (to accumulate the trapped water), `ml`, and `mr` (to track maximum heights).
   
2. **While Loop**:
   - The loop iterates while `l < r`. In each iteration, based on the comparison between `n[l]` and `n[r]`, it calculates trapped water and adjusts pointers and maximum heights accordingly.

3. **Final Result**:
   - The total trapped water is returned in `ans`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array, as each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) since only a constant amount of extra space is used for variables.
