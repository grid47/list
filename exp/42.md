### Problem Statement

The **trapping rain water problem** involves calculating the amount of water that can be trapped between bars of varying heights, after raining. The bars are represented by an array where each element in the array represents the height of a bar. The goal is to find out how much water is trapped between the bars after a rainfall, given that the water can only accumulate between two higher bars.

For example:
- Input: `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`
- Output: `6`

In the above example, the bars with heights 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, and 1 can trap a total of 6 units of water.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a **two-pointer approach** along with two variables (`ml` and `mr`) that track the maximum heights seen from the left and right sides, respectively.

#### Key Concept:
The water trapped above a bar depends on the minimum of the maximum heights on its left and right sides, as the water can only be held up by the shorter of the two. This approach leverages the fact that if we know the maximum height to the left and right of a given bar, we can easily calculate the trapped water above it.

#### Approach Outline:
1. **Two Pointers:** 
   - Initialize two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), pointing to the leftmost and rightmost bars, respectively.
   - Keep track of two variables: `ml` for the maximum height seen from the left and `mr` for the maximum height seen from the right.

2. **Iterate and Calculate Trapped Water:**
   - Move the pointers towards each other, comparing the heights of the bars at `l` and `r`.
   - If the height at `l` is smaller, we calculate how much water can be trapped at position `l` based on the maximum height from the left (`ml`).
   - If the height at `r` is smaller or equal, we calculate how much water can be trapped at position `r` based on the maximum height from the right (`mr`).

3. **Max Heights Update:**
   - As we move the pointers, update `ml` and `mr` to reflect the new maximum heights encountered.

4. **Termination:**
   - The loop continues until the left pointer is greater than or equal to the right pointer, at which point we return the total amount of trapped water.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int trap(vector<int>& n) {
        int l = 0, r = n.size() - 1, ans = 0, ml = 0, mr = 0;
        while (l < r)
            if (n[l] < n[r]) ans += (ml = max(ml, n[l])) - n[l++];
            else ans += (mr = max(mr, n[r])) - n[r--];
        return ans;
    }
};
```

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

```cpp
int l = 0, r = n.size() - 1, ans = 0, ml = 0, mr = 0;
```

- `l`: The left pointer, initialized to the first index (`0`).
- `r`: The right pointer, initialized to the last index (`n.size() - 1`).
- `ans`: This will hold the total amount of water trapped. It starts at 0.
- `ml`: The maximum height encountered from the left side, initialized to 0.
- `mr`: The maximum height encountered from the right side, initialized to 0.

#### Step 2: Iterate Through the Array Using Two Pointers

```cpp
while (l < r)
```

- The `while` loop runs as long as `l` is less than `r`, meaning the left pointer is to the left of the right pointer.

#### Step 3: Compare Heights and Calculate Water

```cpp
if (n[l] < n[r]) ans += (ml = max(ml, n[l])) - n[l++];
else ans += (mr = max(mr, n[r])) - n[r--];
```

- **If `n[l] < n[r]`**:
  - We update `ml` to the maximum of the current value of `ml` and `n[l]`.
  - Calculate how much water can be trapped at index `l`. The trapped water is `ml - n[l]` because `ml` is the maximum height encountered so far from the left.
  - Move the left pointer `l` to the right (`l++`).
  
- **Else**:
  - We update `mr` to the maximum of the current value of `mr` and `n[r]`.
  - Calculate how much water can be trapped at index `r`. The trapped water is `mr - n[r]` because `mr` is the maximum height encountered so far from the right.
  - Move the right pointer `r` to the left (`r--`).

#### Step 4: Return the Total Trapped Water

```cpp
return ans;
```

- After the loop terminates, we return the accumulated `ans`, which contains the total amount of water trapped.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity is **O(n)** because we only iterate through the array once. In each iteration, we compare and update the two pointers, which is done in constant time.

#### Space Complexity:

- The space complexity is **O(1)** because we use only a constant amount of extra space (variables `l`, `r`, `ans`, `ml`, and `mr`). We do not use any extra data structures or arrays apart from the input array.

### Conclusion

This approach efficiently calculates the total amount of water trapped between the bars using a two-pointer technique. It runs in **O(n)** time and uses **O(1)** space, making it optimal for this problem. The solution ensures that each element is processed once, and the space usage remains constant, which is ideal for large inputs.

By leveraging the concept of the maximum heights encountered from both sides (`ml` and `mr`), the algorithm avoids the need for additional arrays or nested loops, leading to a clean and efficient solution. This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, making it well-suited for solving the trapping rain water problem.
