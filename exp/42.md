### üåßÔ∏è **Trapping Rain Water Problem**

The **trapping rain water problem** involves calculating the total amount of water that can be trapped between bars of varying heights after a rainfall. The bars are represented as an array where each element represents the height of a bar. Water can only accumulate between two bars that are taller than the bar in between.

#### Example:
- **Input**: `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`
- **Output**: `6`

In this case, the amount of water trapped between the bars is `6` units, as illustrated by the gaps between the bars.

### üîë **Approach: Two-Pointer Method**

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a **two-pointer approach**. This approach maintains two variables (`ml` and `mr`) which track the maximum heights encountered from the left and right sides, respectively. The trapped water above any bar depends on the minimum of the maximum heights on both sides.

#### Approach Outline:
1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables**: 
   - Use two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), pointing to the leftmost and rightmost bars, respectively.
   - Track two variables, `ml` and `mr`, which hold the maximum heights encountered from the left and right sides.

2. **Iterate and Calculate Water**:
   - Move the pointers towards each other, comparing the heights at `l` and `r`.
   - If the height at `l` is smaller, calculate how much water can be trapped at position `l` based on the left maximum height (`ml`).
   - If the height at `r` is smaller or equal, calculate how much water can be trapped at position `r` based on the right maximum height (`mr`).

3. **Update Maximum Heights**:
   - As we move the pointers, update the maximum heights (`ml` and `mr`) based on the heights at the current positions of `l` and `r`.

4. **Stop Condition**:
   - The loop continues until the left pointer `l` exceeds or meets the right pointer `r`.

### üîç **Code Breakdown (Step-by-Step)**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int trap(vector<int>& n) {
        int l = 0, r = n.size() - 1, ans = 0, ml = 0, mr = 0;
        while (l < r) {
            if (n[l] < n[r]) {
                ans += (ml = max(ml, n[l])) - n[l++];
            } else {
                ans += (mr = max(mr, n[r])) - n[r--];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

```cpp
int l = 0, r = n.size() - 1, ans = 0, ml = 0, mr = 0;
```
- **`l`**: Left pointer, starting at index `0`.
- **`r`**: Right pointer, starting at the last index (`n.size() - 1`).
- **`ans`**: Variable to accumulate the total trapped water.
- **`ml`**: Maximum height encountered from the left, initialized to `0`.
- **`mr`**: Maximum height encountered from the right, initialized to `0`.

#### Step 2: Iterate Using Two Pointers

```cpp
while (l < r)
```
- Continue looping as long as the left pointer `l` is to the left of the right pointer `r`.

#### Step 3: Compare Heights and Calculate Water

```cpp
if (n[l] < n[r]) {
    ans += (ml = max(ml, n[l])) - n[l++];
} else {
    ans += (mr = max(mr, n[r])) - n[r--];
}
```
- **If `n[l] < n[r]`**: 
  - Update `ml` to be the maximum of `ml` and `n[l]`.
  - Calculate the trapped water at index `l`: `ml - n[l]`.
  - Move the left pointer `l` to the right (`l++`).

- **Else**: 
  - Update `mr` to be the maximum of `mr` and `n[r]`.
  - Calculate the trapped water at index `r`: `mr - n[r]`.
  - Move the right pointer `r` to the left (`r--`).

#### Step 4: Return the Total Water Trapped

```cpp
return ans;
```
- After the loop ends, return the total amount of water trapped, stored in `ans`.

### üìä **Complexity Analysis**

#### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity is **O(n)** because the algorithm only iterates through the array once. Each step compares and updates the two pointers in constant time.

#### Space Complexity:

- The space complexity is **O(1)** because only a constant amount of extra space is used (the variables `l`, `r`, `ans`, `ml`, and `mr`).

### üèÅ **Conclusion**

This solution efficiently calculates the total amount of water trapped using a **two-pointer approach**. By maintaining maximum heights from both the left and right sides (`ml` and `mr`), we can compute the trapped water at each position without needing extra space or nested loops.

- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**

This approach is both **time-efficient** and **space-efficient**, making it an optimal solution for large input sizes. By leveraging the idea of "maximum heights from both sides," we avoid unnecessary recomputation, ensuring that the solution is both clean and scalable.
