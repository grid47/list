### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree (not necessarily a binary search tree), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes `p` and `q`. The LCA is the lowest node in the tree that has both `p` and `q` as descendants.

### Approach
In a general binary tree, the BST properties do not apply, so we must search both subtrees to determine the LCA.

1. If `root` is `null`, `p`, or `q`, then `root` is a potential LCA and is returned immediately.
2. Recursively search for `p` and `q` in both left and right subtrees.
3. If both `left` and `right` subtrees return non-null values, it means `p` and `q` were found in different subtrees, so `root` is their LCA.
4. If only one side returns a non-null value, it means both `p` and `q` are located on that side, so return the non-null subtree result as the LCA.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: Root of a binary tree and two nodes `p` and `q`.
- **Output**: The lowest common ancestor node of `p` and `q`.
- **Base Condition**: If `root` is `null`, `p`, or `q`, return `root`.

1. Recursively call `lowestCommonAncestor` on `root->left` and store the result in `left`.
2. Recursively call `lowestCommonAncestor` on `root->right` and store the result in `right`.
3. If `left` is `null`, return `right`; if `right` is `null`, return `left`.
4. If both `left` and `right` are non-null, return `root` as it is the LCA.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node may be visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack.
