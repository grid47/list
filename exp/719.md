### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to find the **k-th smallest distance pair** in a given array of integers, `nums`. A **distance pair** is defined as the absolute difference between two numbers in the array, i.e., the distance between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `i < j`. Given a value `k`, our task is to determine the **k-th smallest distance** pair from all possible pairs in the array.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize a combination of **binary search** and a **two-pointer technique**. The basic idea is to:

1. **Sort the array**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently finding the possible pairs.
2. **Binary search on the answer**: Since the possible distances range from `0` to `nums[n-1] - nums[0]` (the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted array), we perform a binary search on the distance.
3. **Count the number of pairs**: For each middle value `m` in the binary search, we calculate how many pairs have a distance less than or equal to `m`. This can be done efficiently using a two-pointer approach.
4. **Adjust the binary search bounds**: Depending on whether the number of pairs is smaller or larger than `k`, we adjust the search range to zero in on the k-th smallest distance.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let’s break down the code to understand how it works:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   ```cpp
   sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
   ```
   - The first step in the algorithm is to sort the input array `nums`. Sorting ensures that we can efficiently calculate the number of pairs with a distance less than or equal to a given value.

2. **Initial Binary Search Bounds**:
   ```cpp
   int n = nums.size();
   int l = 0;
   int r = nums[n - 1] - nums[0];
   ```
   - We define the range of distances to search over. The lower bound `l` is set to `0` (the minimum possible distance), and the upper bound `r` is set to `nums[n - 1] - nums[0]` (the largest possible distance between any two elements in the sorted array).

3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   ```cpp
   for(int cnt = 0; l < r; cnt = 0) {
       int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
   ```
   - We perform a binary search on the possible distances `m`. The mid-point `m` is calculated by `l + (r - l) / 2`. The loop continues until `l` equals `r`, which means the search space is narrowed down to a single value (the answer).

4. **Counting Pairs with Distance ≤ m**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0, j = 0; i < n; i++) {
       while(j < n && nums[j] <= nums[i] + m) j++;
       cnt += (j - i - 1);
   }
   ```
   - For each `m`, we count how many pairs have a distance less than or equal to `m`. This is done using a two-pointer approach:
     - `i` represents the left pointer, and `j` is the right pointer.
     - For each `i`, we move `j` to the right until `nums[j]` exceeds `nums[i] + m`. This ensures that all the pairs `nums[i], nums[j]` where `i < j` and `nums[j] - nums[i] ≤ m` are counted.
     - The number of such pairs for each `i` is `j - i - 1`, and we add this to the `cnt`.

5. **Adjusting the Binary Search Bounds**:
   ```cpp
   if(cnt < k) {
       l = m + 1;
   } else r = m;
   ```
   - After counting the number of pairs with a distance ≤ `m`, we check if this count is less than `k`. If it is, we need to search for a larger distance, so we update `l = m + 1`.
   - Otherwise, if the count is greater than or equal to `k`, we search for a smaller or equal distance, so we update `r = m`.

6. **Returning the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return l;
   ```
   - Once the binary search loop ends, the value of `l` represents the `k`-th smallest distance pair.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Sorting the array takes **O(n log n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.
  - The binary search operates on the range from `0` to `nums[n-1] - nums[0]`, which can be at most **O(nums[n-1] - nums[0])**. For each value of `m`, we use the two-pointer approach to count the pairs, which takes **O(n)** time.
  - Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n + n log D)**, where `D` is the maximum possible distance between any two numbers in the array (`nums[n-1] - nums[0]`).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space aside from the input array, so the space complexity is **O(1)**.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the problem of finding the k-th smallest distance pair by combining binary search and a two-pointer technique. By sorting the array first and then using binary search on the possible distances, we can narrow down the search space efficiently. The two-pointer technique is used to count the number of valid pairs for each candidate distance, allowing us to adjust the binary search bounds accordingly.

The time complexity of **O(n log n + n log D)** ensures that the solution is efficient even for large input arrays. The approach also has a space complexity of **O(1)**, making it suitable for problems with memory constraints. Overall, this is a highly efficient and optimized solution to the problem of finding the k-th smallest distance pair in an array.
