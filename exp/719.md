### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k`-th smallest distance among all the distances calculated from pairs of elements in the array. The distance between a pair of elements is defined as the absolute difference between them.

### Approach
1. **Sorting**:
   - First, sort the array `nums` to facilitate the calculation of distances in a structured manner.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - Use binary search to find the smallest possible distance that can yield at least `k` pairs.
   - The search range is defined from `0` (minimum possible distance) to `nums[n - 1] - nums[0]` (maximum possible distance).

3. **Counting Pairs**:
   - For each mid-point `m` in the binary search:
     - Count how many pairs have a distance less than or equal to `m`.
     - Use a two-pointer technique to efficiently count the valid pairs:
       - For each `i`, find the rightmost `j` such that `nums[j] <= nums[i] + m`.
       - The count of valid pairs for a fixed `i` is `j - i - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the Search Range**:
   - If the count of pairs is less than `k`, adjust the left boundary of the search range.
   - Otherwise, adjust the right boundary.

5. **Result**:
   - The value of `l` at the end of the binary search represents the `k`-th smallest distance.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function**:
  - `smallestDistancePair(vector<int>& nums, int k)`: Computes the `k`-th smallest distance among all pairs in `nums`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log(maxDistance)), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums` and `maxDistance` is the maximum possible distance between the smallest and largest elements.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the space used in the binary search and counting operations.
