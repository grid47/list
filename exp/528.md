### Problem Statement
Design a class `Solution` that accepts an array of weights `w` and has a method `pickIndex()` that randomly picks an index such that the probability of picking an index `i` is proportional to `w[i]`.

### Approach
1. **Prefix Sum Array**:
   - Initialize a prefix sum array `wc` where each element `wc[i]` represents the sum of weights from the beginning of the array up to index `i`.
   - This allows us to determine the cumulative weights, which helps in simulating the weighted random selection.

2. **Random Selection**:
   - Generate a random number `x` between `1` and `wc.back()`, which represents the total weight.
   - Use binary search to find the first index `i` in the prefix sum array `wc` such that `wc[i] >= x`.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to perform the binary search.
   - Calculate the midpoint and check if the value at that index is equal to `x`. If equal, return the index.
   - Adjust the pointers based on whether the value at the midpoint is less than or greater than `x`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Construct the prefix sum array during the instantiation of the `Solution` class.

2. **Pick Index Method**:
   - Generate a random number and use binary search to find the appropriate index based on the cumulative weights.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) for the `pickIndex()` method due to the binary search, and O(n) for initializing the prefix sum array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the prefix sum array.
