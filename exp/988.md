### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree where each node contains an integer from 0 to 25, representing letters 'a' to 'z', return the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf and ends at the root.

### Approach
- Use DFS to traverse each path from root to leaf.
- For each leaf, build a string from the current path's values, converting each integer to its corresponding letter, and reverse the path direction from leaf to root.
- Track the lexicographically smallest string found by comparing it with the current smallest answer.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Base Case**: If the node is `nullptr`, return as there’s no path.
2. **Leaf Node Check**: If a leaf node is reached, convert its path to a string and update `ans` if it’s lexicographically smaller.
3. **Recursive Calls**: Traverse left and right children, appending the current node's character to the path.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursive stack.
