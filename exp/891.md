### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of the widths of all subsequences of the array. The width of a subsequence is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of that subsequence.

### Approach
To compute the sum of subsequence widths efficiently:
1. **Sorting**: Sort the array to easily identify the minimum and maximum values of subsequences.
2. **Contribution Calculation**: 
   - Each element in the sorted array contributes to several subsequences as both a minimum and a maximum.
   - For an element at index `i` in a sorted array of size `n`:
     - It contributes as the minimum in all subsequences formed with elements to its right (indices \(i+1\) to \(n-1\)).
     - It contributes as the maximum in all subsequences formed with elements to its left (indices \(0\) to \(i-1\)).
3. **Combinatorial Counting**:
   - The number of ways an element can be the minimum is \(2^{(n-i-1)}\) (choices for elements on the right).
   - The number of ways an element can be the maximum is \(2^{i}\) (choices for elements on the left).
   - The total contribution of the element at index `i` is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{contribution} = \text{nums}[i] \times 2^{(n-i-1)} - \text{nums}[n-1-i] \times 2^{i}
     \]

### Steps
1. Sort the `nums` array.
2. Initialize a result variable and a variable to calculate powers of 2.
3. Loop through the sorted array, calculating contributions for each element as described above.
4. Return the result, ensuring to take modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to avoid overflow.

### Code Walk-through
- The `sumSubseqWidths` function first sorts the input array.
- It then calculates the contribution of each element as both minimum and maximum across all possible subsequences.
- Finally, it returns the sum of these contributions modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\), due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), not considering the input/output storage.
