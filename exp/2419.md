### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray that contains only the maximum element from the given array. In other words, we need to identify the longest sequence where all elements are equal to the maximum value of the array.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. First, find the maximum value in the array using the `max_element` function.
2. Iterate through the array while keeping track of the current length of the contiguous subarray of maximum elements.
3. If the current element is equal to the maximum value, we increase the length of the current subarray. Otherwise, reset the length to zero.
4. Keep track of the maximum length found during the iteration and return it as the result.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. Finding the Maximum Element

```cpp
int x = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
```

- The first step is to find the maximum element in the array `nums`. This is done using the `max_element` function, which returns an iterator to the largest element in the range `[nums.begin(), nums.end())`. By dereferencing this iterator, we obtain the value of the maximum element `x`.

#### 2. Initializing Variables

```cpp
int len = 0, ans = 0;
```

- We initialize two variables:
  - `len` to store the length of the current contiguous subarray of maximum elements.
  - `ans` to store the maximum length of contiguous subarrays of the maximum element found so far.

#### 3. Iterating Through the Array

```cpp
for(int ele: nums) {
    if(ele == x) {
        ans = max(ans, ++len);
    } else len = 0;
}
```

- We loop through each element `ele` in the array `nums`:
  - If the element `ele` is equal to the maximum element `x`, it means we are still in a contiguous subarray of maximum elements. We increment `len` and update `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `len`.
  - If the element `ele` is not equal to `x`, it means the contiguous subarray of maximum elements has ended, so we reset `len` to zero to start counting the next possible subarray.

#### 4. Returning the Result

```cpp
return ans;
```

- After iterating through the array, we return the value of `ans`, which stores the length of the longest contiguous subarray of maximum elements.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(N)**: The time complexity is dominated by the iteration through the array, which takes linear time. Finding the maximum element using `max_element` also takes O(N) time, so the overall time complexity is O(N), where `N` is the size of the input array.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant because we are only using a few extra variables (`len` and `ans`) and no additional data structures that depend on the input size.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the problem by leveraging the linear traversal of the array. By tracking the longest contiguous subarray of the maximum element, we ensure that we can find the result in O(N) time. The algorithm is both time-efficient and space-efficient, making it a good choice for this problem. The use of simple logic and standard library functions like `max_element` makes the code clean and easy to understand.
