### Problem Statement
Given a grid of strings representing a map of regions separated by slashes (`/` and `\`), determine how many distinct regions exist. Each slash represents a wall that divides the grid into different regions.

### Approach
1. **Grid Expansion**:
   - Expand the original grid into a larger grid (3 times the size in both dimensions) to represent the subdivisions caused by the slashes.
   - Each character in the grid affects three cells in the expanded grid:
     - A `/` at `(i, j)` will block certain areas in the expanded grid.
     - A `\` at `(i, j)` will block a different set of areas.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Use DFS to explore the regions in the expanded grid.
   - Each time DFS is called on an unvisited cell, it indicates the discovery of a new region.
   - Mark cells as visited by changing their value in the grid.

3. **Count Regions**:
   - Initialize a region counter and increment it each time a new region is found through DFS.

### Code Walk-through
1. **`regionsBySlashes` Method**:
   - Initializes a 2D vector `g` of size `(n * 3) x (n * 3)` to represent the expanded grid.
   - Iterates through the original grid, updating the expanded grid based on the presence of slashes.
   - Loops through the expanded grid and calls the `dfs` function for each unvisited cell to count the regions.

2. **`dfs` Method**:
   - Checks for boundary conditions and whether the current cell has been visited.
   - Marks the current cell as visited.
   - Recursively explores the four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) and returns the total count of cells visited.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the size of the input grid since each cell in the expanded grid is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) for the expanded grid representation.
