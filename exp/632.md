### Problem Statement
Given `k` sorted integer arrays, you need to find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the `k` arrays. The result should be returned as a vector of two integers representing the start and end of the smallest range.

### Approach
1. **Flatten the Arrays**:
   - Create a vector of pairs where each pair contains an element and its corresponding array index. This will help us track which array each element belongs to.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the flattened vector based on the elements. This allows us to efficiently find the smallest range by sliding through the sorted elements.

3. **Using a HashMap**:
   - Use a hashmap to count the occurrences of elements from each array as we slide through the sorted list. The key is the array index, and the value is the count of elements taken from that array.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - Use two pointers to maintain a window of valid elements. The right pointer expands the window to include more elements, while the left pointer contracts the window to find the smallest range.
   - Keep track of how many arrays are represented in the current window. Once all arrays are represented (i.e., count equals `k`), attempt to minimize the range by moving the left pointer.

5. **Update the Result**:
   - Whenever a valid range is found (i.e., all arrays are included), check if it is smaller than the previously found range and update the result accordingly.

### Code Walk-through
1. Create a vector of pairs to flatten the input arrays.
2. Sort the pairs based on their values.
3. Use a hashmap to track counts of elements from each array.
4. Iterate through the sorted elements, updating the counts and checking for valid ranges using a sliding window.
5. Return the smallest range found.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N), where `N` is the total number of elements across all arrays due to sorting. The sliding window operation is O(N).
- **Space Complexity**: O(K + N), where `K` is the number of arrays for the hashmap and `N` is for the vector storing flattened elements.
