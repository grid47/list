### Problem Statement
You have `bckt` buckets of liquid, one of which is poisoned. You have `die` pigs that can be used to determine which bucket is poisoned, and you can test them for `test` minutes. The goal is to find out the minimum number of pigs needed to guarantee identifying the poisoned bucket within the given time limit.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Each pig can be tested multiple times within the allowed time frame.
   - The results from the tests can be used to create a strategy to identify the poisoned bucket.

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - If you have `die` pigs, each can provide `test/die + 1` outcomes (the pig can survive or die after each test).
   - Thus, with `pigs` pigs, the total number of different combinations of results you can derive is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{total outcomes} = \left(\frac{\text{test}}{\text{die}} + 1\right)^{\text{pigs}}
     \]

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Pigs**:
   - Start with `pigs` initialized to `0` and incrementally increase `pigs` until the number of possible outcomes is greater than or equal to the number of buckets (`bckt`).

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `pigs` is initialized to `0`.

2. **While Loop**:
   - A while loop checks if the total outcomes generated by `pigs` pigs is less than `bckt`.
   - If it is, it increments the `pigs` count.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Once the condition is satisfied, it returns the number of pigs required.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log(bckt)), since in each iteration of the loop, the count of pigs increases linearly until it satisfies the bucket condition.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as no additional data structures are used, only a few integer variables.
