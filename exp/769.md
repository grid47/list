### Problem Statement
Given an array `arr`, the task is to divide it into the maximum number of chunks such that when each chunk is sorted individually and then concatenated, the result is a sorted array.

### Approach
1. **Chunk Counting**:
   - Initialize `mx` to track the maximum value encountered so far in the array.
   - Iterate through the array and for each index `i`:
     - Update `mx` to be the maximum of `mx` and the current element `arr[i]`.
     - If `mx` equals `i`, it indicates that all elements up to index `i` can form a valid chunk. Increment the chunk count (`res`).

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method for counting the maximum chunks.

- **Method**:
  - `int maxChunksToSorted(vector<int>& arr)`: Implements the logic to determine the maximum number of chunks.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array, since it iterates through the array only once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space for variables.
