### Problem Statement
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the reversed list's head.

### Approach
1. **Pointer Initialization**:
   - Use three pointers: 
     - `head` to traverse the list,
     - `nxt` to temporarily store the next node,
     - `prv` to keep track of the previous node, initially set to `NULL`.

2. **Iterate Through the List**:
   - While `head` is not `NULL` (meaning there are still nodes to process):
     - Store the next node (`nxt = head->next`).
     - Reverse the link of the current node (`head->next = prv`).
     - Move the `prv` pointer to the current node (`prv = head`).
     - Advance the `head` pointer to the next node (`head = nxt`).

3. **Return the New Head**:
   - After the loop, `prv` will be pointing to the new head of the reversed list. Return `prv`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the `ListNode` structure.
- **Line 2**: Define the class `Solution`.
- **Line 3**: Define the function `reverseList(ListNode* head)`.
- **Lines 4-8**: 
  - Initialize pointers (`nxt`, `prv`) and iterate through the linked list.
  - Update the `next` pointers to reverse the links.
- **Line 9**: Return the new head of the reversed list (`prv`).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list, as each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since no additional data structures are used that depend on the size of the input list.
