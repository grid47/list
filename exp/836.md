### Problem Statement
Determine whether two rectangles overlap. Each rectangle is defined by its bottom-left and top-right corners given as integer coordinates.

### Approach
1. **Extract Coordinates**:
   - For each rectangle, extract the coordinates:
     - `rect1`: bottom-left (`fx1`, `fy1`) and top-right (`fx2`, `fy2`)
     - `rect2`: bottom-left (`sx1`, `sy1`) and top-right (`sx2`, `sy2`)

2. **Check for Overlap**:
   - The rectangles do not overlap if any of the following conditions are true:
     - Rectangle 2 is completely above Rectangle 1: `sy1 >= fy2`
     - Rectangle 1 is completely above Rectangle 2: `fy1 >= sy2`
     - Rectangle 2 is completely to the right of Rectangle 1: `fx1 >= sx2`
     - Rectangle 1 is completely to the right of Rectangle 2: `fx2 <= sx1`
   - If none of these conditions are true, the rectangles overlap.

### Code Walk-through
- The method takes two vectors representing the rectangles.
- It checks the conditions for no overlap and returns `true` if the rectangles overlap and `false` otherwise.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1), since we perform a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a fixed amount of space for variables.
