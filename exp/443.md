### Problem Statement
Given a character array `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:
- Begin with an empty string. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in `chars`, append the character followed by its count if greater than 1. 
- The compressed string should be stored in the same array `chars`. The function should return the new length of the compressed string.

### Approach
1. **Two Pointers**:
   - Use two pointers, `i` to iterate through the original array and `j` to build the compressed version.

2. **Count Consecutive Characters**:
   - For each character at position `i`, count how many times it appears consecutively.
   - Move `i` forward until the character changes, counting occurrences.

3. **Building the Compressed Array**:
   - For each character, write it to `chars[j]`.
   - If the count of the character is greater than 1, convert the count to a string and append each digit to `chars`.

4. **Update Pointer**:
   - After processing a group, update the pointer `j` to the next position for writing.

5. **Return New Length**:
   - Once the loop finishes, return the new length of the compressed array.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `i` and `j` to zero.
   
2. **Outer Loop**:
   - Iterate while `i` is less than the size of `chars`.
   
3. **Inner Counting Loop**:
   - Count the number of occurrences of `chars[i]` and move `i` accordingly.

4. **Writing to the Array**:
   - Write the character to `chars[j]`. If the count is greater than 1, convert the count to a string and append each character to `chars`.

5. **Final Length**:
   - After processing all characters, return the value of `j`, which represents the new length of the compressed array.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we make a single pass through the characters.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we use the input array for storage without requiring additional space.
