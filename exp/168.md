### Problem Statement
Given an integer `columnNumber`, convert it to its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel spreadsheet. For example, `1` → "A", `2` → "B", ..., `26` → "Z", `27` → "AA", and so on.

### Approach
1. **Base Conversion**:
   - Treat the problem similarly to converting a number to a different base (base 26 in this case).
   - Since Excel columns are 1-indexed, adjust the column number by decrementing it before performing the modulo operation.
   
2. **Construct the Title**:
   - Use a loop to repeatedly divide the column number by 26:
     - Compute the current character using the modulo operation and convert it to a character.
     - Prepend the character to the result string.
     - Update the column number for the next iteration.

### Code Walk-through
- **Lines 1-2**: Define the function and initialize an empty string `res` to store the result.
- **Line 3**: Start a while loop that continues until the `columnNumber` is greater than 0.
- **Lines 4-6**: Inside the loop:
  - Decrement `columnNumber` to handle the 1-indexed nature.
  - Compute the modulo to determine the current character.
  - Convert the integer to a corresponding character and prepend it to the result string.
  - Update the `columnNumber` for the next iteration by dividing it by 26.
- **Line 7**: Return the resulting string.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\log_{26}(N))\), where \(N\) is the `columnNumber`, as we divide by 26 in each iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) for the variable storage, not counting the space required for the output string.
