### Problem Statement

The problem asks to count the number of triplets `(i, j, k)` in the array `nums[]` such that:

\[ \text{nums}[i] \& \text{nums}[j] \& \text{nums}[k] = 0 \]

where `&` represents the **bitwise AND** operation. You are tasked with implementing a solution that efficiently counts all such triplets.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the **bitwise AND** operation and how it can be leveraged to find triplets satisfying the condition.

#### Key Insights:
1. **Bitwise AND**:
   - The result of the bitwise AND between two numbers is a number where a bit is set to `1` if both corresponding bits in the operands are `1`, otherwise the bit is set to `0`.
   - For the condition `nums[i] & nums[j] & nums[k] = 0` to hold, all bits in the result of the AND operation between `nums[i]`, `nums[j]`, and `nums[k]` must be zero.

2. **Breaking Down the Problem**:
   - We need to count all triplets `(i, j, k)` such that the bitwise AND of `nums[i]`, `nums[j]`, and `nums[k]` is zero.
   - A brute force solution would involve iterating through all possible triplets, which would be computationally expensive with a time complexity of **O(n^3)**, where `n` is the size of the array `nums[]`.
   
3. **Optimized Approach**:
   - We can optimize the solution using a **frequency map** (`mp`) to store the results of pairwise ANDs of the elements in the array.
   - Once we have these pairwise AND results stored in the map, we can use another iteration over the array to count the triplets that satisfy the condition using efficient lookups.

#### Algorithm Overview:
- We first create a frequency map to store the number of occurrences of each possible result from the pairwise bitwise AND operation between the elements of the array.
- Then, for each element in the array, we calculate how many previously stored AND results will satisfy the condition when combined with the current element.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. **Data Structure Initialization**:
```cpp
vector<int> mp(1<<16, 0);
```
- We initialize a vector `mp` of size `2^16` (65536) to keep track of the frequency of each possible result of a pairwise AND operation between two elements in `nums[]`.
- The size `2^16` is chosen because the bitwise AND of any two numbers in `nums[]` will result in a number that can be represented in 16 bits (since `nums[i]` values are constrained to 16 bits).

#### 2. **Counting Pairwise AND Results**:
```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        mp[nums[i] & nums[j]]++;
    }
```
- We iterate over every pair of elements `(i, j)` in the array `nums[]`.
- For each pair `(i, j)`, we calculate the bitwise AND of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` and increment the corresponding count in the `mp` vector.

#### 3. **Counting Valid Triplets**:
```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    for(int j = 0; j < (1 << 16); j++)
        if((j & nums[i]) == 0) res += mp[j];
```
- Now, we iterate through the array `nums[]` again, and for each element `nums[i]`, we check which values of `j` (from the frequency map `mp`) satisfy the condition `(j & nums[i]) == 0`.
- If the condition holds true, it means that the current `nums[i]` can form a valid triplet with the pairwise AND result `j` from the frequency map.
- We add the count of such valid pairs to the result `res`.

#### 4. **Returning the Result**:
```cpp
return res;
```
- Finally, we return the total count of valid triplets.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Pairwise AND Counting**: The first nested loop iterates over all pairs `(i, j)` in the array. This takes **O(n^2)** time, where `n` is the size of the array.
- **Counting Valid Triplets**: The second nested loop iterates over the array and the possible pairwise AND results (which is `2^16 = 65536`), making this loop **O(n * 65536)**. 
  Since the maximum size of `n` is typically much smaller than `65536`, this loop is effectively **O(n)**.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is:
\[
O(n^2 + n \cdot 65536) = O(n^2)
\]
This is a significant improvement over the brute-force solution with **O(n^3)** time complexity.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space for Frequency Map**: We are using a vector `mp` of size `65536` to store the frequency of each possible result of a pairwise AND operation. Thus, the space complexity is **O(65536)**, which is effectively **O(1)** since it is a constant size.
- **Space for Input Array**: The input array `nums[]` takes **O(n)** space.

Thus, the overall space complexity is:
\[
O(n + 65536) = O(n)
\]
The space complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input array.

### Conclusion

The `countTriplets` function efficiently counts the number of valid triplets `(i, j, k)` in the array `nums[]` that satisfy the condition `nums[i] & nums[j] & nums[k] = 0`. By using a frequency map to store the results of pairwise AND operations, the solution avoids the computational overhead of a brute force approach and reduces the time complexity to **O(n^2)**. The space complexity is **O(n)**, making the algorithm efficient for large arrays. This solution provides an optimal and scalable approach for solving the problem.
