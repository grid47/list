### Problem Statement

The problem requires us to count the number of valid pairs `(i, j)` from an array `nums` where the following condition holds:

\[
\text{gcd}(nums[i], k) \times \text{gcd}(nums[j], k) \text{ is divisible by } k
\]

Where:
- `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
- `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are the elements of the array `nums`, and `i < j`.
- `k` is a given integer.

The objective is to efficiently count all such pairs while respecting the constraints of the problem.

### Approach

To approach this problem efficiently, we need to break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Condition**:
   The condition to check for each pair `(i, j)` is that the product of the greatest common divisors (`gcd(nums[i], k)` and `gcd(nums[j], k)`) must be divisible by `k`. This means we need to check whether the greatest common divisors of each element in the array `nums` with `k` satisfy a divisibility condition.

2. **Key Insight**:
   Rather than checking every possible pair `(i, j)` explicitly, we can reduce the problem to counting pairs using a hashmap. Specifically:
   - For each number `num` in the array, compute `gcd(num, k)`.
   - For each number `num`, check how many previously encountered values of `gcd(nums[i], k)` satisfy the condition `(gcd(nums[i], k) * gcd(nums[j], k)) % k == 0`.
   - This allows us to efficiently count pairs without needing to check all combinations explicitly.

3. **Steps**:
   - We maintain a hashmap `gm` where the key is the `gcd(num, k)` and the value is the count of occurrences of that `gcd` in the previous numbers.
   - For each number in `nums`, compute its `gcd` with `k` and check how many previous `gcd` values from the hashmap satisfy the condition.
   - Update the hashmap with the current `gcd` for future iterations.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```java
class Solution {
    public long countPairs(int[] nums, int k) {
        long res = 0;  // To store the result (number of valid pairs)
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> gm = new HashMap<>();  // Hashmap to store gcd values and their counts
        
        // Iterate through each number in the nums array
        for(int num: nums) {

            // Step 1: Compute gcd of current number and k
            int gcd = findGCD(num, k);

            // Step 2: Check all previously encountered gcd values
            for(int node: gm.keySet()) {

                // If the product of gcd(num, k) and the previous gcd is divisible by k
                if((long) gcd * node % k == 0) 
                    res += gm.get(node);  // Increment result by the count of valid pairs

            }

            // Step 3: Update the hashmap with the current gcd
            gm.put(gcd, gm.getOrDefault(gcd, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Return the total count of valid pairs
        return res;
    }
    
    // Helper function to calculate the gcd of two numbers
    private int findGCD(int x, int y) {
        if (x < y) return findGCD(y, x);  // Ensure x >= y for the gcd calculation

        // Base case: if y is 0, return x (gcd)
        return y == 0 ? x : findGCD(y, x % y);
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Each Part of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `long res = 0;` — This variable stores the result, i.e., the total number of valid pairs.
   - `HashMap<Integer, Integer> gm = new HashMap<>();` — This hashmap is used to store the frequency of each `gcd(num, k)` encountered during the iteration through the array `nums`.

2. **Iterating Through the Array**:
   - `for (int num : nums)` — We loop through each element `num` in the `nums` array.
   
3. **Calculating GCD**:
   - `int gcd = findGCD(num, k);` — For each number `num`, we compute the `gcd(num, k)` using the `findGCD` function.

4. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - `for (int node : gm.keySet())` — For each previously encountered `gcd` value stored in `gm`, we check if multiplying the current `gcd(num, k)` with this previous `gcd` results in a value divisible by `k`.
   - `if ((long) gcd * node % k == 0)` — This checks if the product of the current `gcd` and the previous `gcd` is divisible by `k`. If true, it means that the pair is valid, so we increment the result by the frequency of that previous `gcd` value (`gm.get(node)`).

5. **Updating the HashMap**:
   - `gm.put(gcd, gm.getOrDefault(gcd, 0) + 1);` — We update the hashmap `gm` with the current `gcd`. If this `gcd` has been encountered before, its count is incremented; otherwise, it's added with a count of 1.

6. **Returning the Result**:
   - After iterating through the entire array, we return the final count of valid pairs stored in `res`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution can be analyzed as follows:
- **GCD Calculation**: The `findGCD` function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD, which has a time complexity of **O(log k)**.
- **Iterating Over the Array**: We iterate through all `n` elements of the `nums` array.
- **HashMap Operations**: For each element, we perform operations on the hashmap, which involves iterating over the keys of the hashmap. In the worst case, the hashmap could contain at most `O(n)` keys (if all `gcd(num, k)` values are distinct). Therefore, iterating over the keys will take **O(n)** in the worst case.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log k)**, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums` and `k` is the value for which we are calculating the `gcd`.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is due to the storage required for the hashmap, which can store up to `O(n)` distinct GCD values.

### Conclusion

This solution provides an efficient way to count valid pairs by utilizing the properties of the GCD and leveraging a hashmap to store previously encountered GCD values. By avoiding the direct comparison of every possible pair, the solution achieves a time complexity of **O(n log k)**, which is much more efficient than a brute force approach. The use of the GCD and the modularity condition makes it possible to solve the problem efficiently even for larger inputs. This approach ensures that we can handle large arrays while maintaining performance and correctness.
