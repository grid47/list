### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. This should be done in-place without making a copy of the array.

### Approach
The solution uses a two-pointer technique to efficiently move zeros to the end of the array:

1. **Pointer Initialization**:
   - Initialize a pointer `j` to keep track of the position to place the next non-zero element.

2. **First Pass - Moving Non-Zero Elements**:
   - Iterate through the array using an index pointer `i`. For each non-zero element found at index `i`, swap it with the element at index `j` and increment `j`.
   - This effectively gathers all non-zero elements at the beginning of the array.

3. **Second Pass - Filling with Zeros**:
   - After all non-zero elements have been moved, fill the remainder of the array (from index `j` to the end) with zeros.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A vector of integers `nums`.
- **Output**: The modified vector `nums` with all zeros moved to the end.

1. Initialize a pointer `j` to `0`.
2. Loop through the array using an index `i`:
   - If `nums[i]` is not zero, swap `nums[i]` with `nums[j]` and increment `j`.
3. After the first loop, fill the array from index `j` to the end with zeros.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array, since each element is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as the operations are performed in place without using additional space.

### Edge Cases
1. **All Zeros**: If `nums` contains only zeros, the output remains unchanged.
2. **No Zeros**: If `nums` contains no zeros, the output remains unchanged.
3. **Single Element**: If `nums` has one element, it remains unchanged, regardless of whether it is zero or not.
