### Problem Statement
Given an integer `k`, return the number of non-negative integers `x` such that the factorial `x!` has exactly `k` trailing zeros.

### Approach
1. **Counting Trailing Zeros**:
   - The number of trailing zeros in `x!` is determined by the number of times `5` can be factored from the numbers in the factorial sequence. This is because `2` is more frequent than `5`, making `5` the limiting factor.
   - Define a helper function `count5(long x)` that counts the trailing zeros in `x!` by summing up the integer division of `x` by powers of `5`.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The goal is to find the largest integer `mid` such that the count of trailing zeros in `mid!` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - Implement a binary search in the `bigWithK(int k)` function to find this boundary.
   - Adjust the search space based on the trailing zero count.

3. **Calculate Range**:
   - The number of integers whose factorials have exactly `k` trailing zeros can be found by determining the range between `bigWithK(k)` and `bigWithK(k - 1)`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the methods for calculating the required values.
    - `long count5(long x)`: Helper function that returns the count of trailing zeros in `x!`.
    - `long bigWithK(int k)`: Finds the largest integer `x` such that `x!` has at most `k` trailing zeros.
    - `int preimageSizeFZF(int k)`: Main function that computes the number of integers `x` such that `x!` has exactly `k` trailing zeros.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `k`: The target number of trailing zeros.
      - **Returns**: The count of integers whose factorials have exactly `k` trailing zeros.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), where \(n\) is the maximum value in the search space.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only a constant amount of space is used for variables.
