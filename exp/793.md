### Problem Statement
The problem is to find how many numbers in the range from `0` to `n` (where `n` is an arbitrary large number) end with exactly `k` trailing zeros in their factorial representation. For example, for `k = 0`, the numbers that have no trailing zeros in their factorials need to be counted, and for larger values of `k`, numbers with exactly `k` trailing zeros in their factorial are counted.

The problem is related to finding trailing zeros in the factorial of numbers. The number of trailing zeros in a number's factorial is determined by the number of times 5 can divide the factorial. This is because each pair of factors 2 and 5 contributes to a trailing zero.

### Approach
To solve this problem efficiently, the approach utilizes binary search to find the range of numbers whose factorials contain exactly `k` trailing zeros. The approach involves two key functions:

1. **`count5(x)`**: This function calculates how many trailing zeros are present in the factorial of `x`. The trailing zeros are determined by counting how many multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., divide `x`. This is done iteratively by dividing `x` by 5 until `x` becomes less than 5.

2. **`bigWithK(k)`**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest number whose factorial contains more than `k` trailing zeros. By adjusting the binary search bounds, the function finds the first number whose factorial has `k+1` trailing zeros.

3. **`preimageSizeFZF(k)`**: This is the main function which calculates how many numbers have exactly `k` trailing zeros in their factorials. The idea is to use the binary search function (`bigWithK`) to find the range of numbers with exactly `k` trailing zeros by calculating the difference between `bigWithK(k)` and `bigWithK(k-1)`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **`count5(long x)` Function**:
   ```cpp
   long count5(long x) {
       long cnt = 0;
       while(x > 0) {
           cnt += x / 5;
           x /= 5;
       }
       return cnt;
   }
   ```
   - The function starts with `cnt = 0`, which will keep track of the count of trailing zeros.
   - For each number `x`, it adds `x / 5` to `cnt`. This counts how many multiples of 5 exist up to `x`. 
   - The process continues by dividing `x` by 5 in each iteration, which also counts multiples of 25, 125, etc., as each of those contributes an additional trailing zero.
   - The loop stops when `x` becomes less than 5, and the function returns the count of trailing zeros.

2. **`bigWithK(int k)` Function**:
   ```cpp
   long bigWithK(int k) {
       long l = 1, r = LLONG_MAX - 1;
       long ans = -1;
       while(l <= r) {
           long mid = l + (r - l + 1) / 2;
           long cnt = count5(mid);
           if(cnt > k) {
               ans = mid;
               r = mid - 1;
           } else {
               l = mid + 1;
           }
       }
       return ans;
   }
   ```
   - This function finds the smallest number whose factorial has more than `k` trailing zeros using binary search.
   - The search starts with `l = 1` and `r = LLONG_MAX - 1` (which is the largest possible value for a long integer).
   - In each iteration, the midpoint `mid` is calculated, and `count5(mid)` is used to count the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of `mid`.
   - If the number of trailing zeros is greater than `k`, we update `ans` and adjust the right bound (`r = mid - 1`), otherwise, we adjust the left bound (`l = mid + 1`).
   - This continues until the search space is exhausted, and the function returns the smallest number whose factorial has more than `k` trailing zeros.

3. **`preimageSizeFZF(int k)` Function**:
   ```cpp
   int preimageSizeFZF(int k) {
       if(k == 0) return 5;
       long a1 = bigWithK(k);
       long a2 = bigWithK(k - 1);        
       return a1 - a2;
   }
   ```
   - The main function that solves the problem.
   - First, it checks if `k` is `0`. In that case, it returns `5`, because the factorial of numbers from `1` to `4` do not have any trailing zeros, so they are the only numbers that contribute to `0` trailing zeros.
   - For any other `k`, the function calculates the smallest number whose factorial has `k` trailing zeros (`a1 = bigWithK(k)`), and the smallest number whose factorial has `k-1` trailing zeros (`a2 = bigWithK(k-1)`).
   - The result is the difference between `a1` and `a2`, which represents how many numbers have exactly `k` trailing zeros in their factorials.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider an example to better understand the solution:

**Example 1**:
- `k = 0`:
   - The function `preimageSizeFZF(0)` will directly return `5`, as explained earlier, because the factorials of numbers `1` to `4` have no trailing zeros.

**Example 2**:
- `k = 1`:
   - The function `bigWithK(1)` will return the smallest number whose factorial has more than 1 trailing zero (let's call this `a1`).
   - The function `bigWithK(0)` will return the smallest number whose factorial has more than 0 trailing zeros (let's call this `a2`).
   - The result will be the difference `a1 - a2`, which gives how many numbers have exactly 1 trailing zero in their factorial.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
   - The `count5(x)` function takes **O(log x)** time because we divide `x` by `5` in each iteration. Since `x` is at most `LLONG_MAX`, this results in approximately **O(log x)** time complexity.
   - The `bigWithK(k)` function uses binary search, which takes **O(log n)**, where `n` is `LLONG_MAX - 1`.
   - The `preimageSizeFZF(k)` function calls `bigWithK(k)` twice, so the overall time complexity is **O(log n)** for a given `k`.

- **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is **O(1)**, as the algorithm only uses a few extra variables for computation, without requiring any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently calculates how many numbers in the range `0` to `n` have exactly `k` trailing zeros in their factorial representation. By using binary search and precomputing trailing zero counts, the solution significantly reduces the complexity compared to a brute force approach. The time complexity is logarithmic, making it suitable for large inputs.

The algorithm's approach of using binary search to find the boundaries of numbers with exactly `k` trailing zeros ensures it works within constraints and performs optimally even for large values of `k`. This solution is highly scalable and optimal for the problem at hand.
