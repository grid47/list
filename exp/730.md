### Problem Statement

The problem asks to calculate the number of palindromic subsequences in a given string `s`. A palindromic subsequence is a sequence of characters from the string that reads the same forward and backward. The task is to count the number of distinct palindromic subsequences in the string, and the result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Approach

This problem can be solved using **dynamic programming (DP)**. The key observation is that a subsequence is palindromic if the first and last characters of the subsequence are the same, and the subsequence formed by removing the first and last characters is also a palindromic subsequence.

The solution involves defining a recursive DP function to count palindromic subsequences between two indices `i` and `j`. The recursive function breaks the problem into smaller subproblems, counting palindromic subsequences for smaller substrings, and combines the results. Memoization is used to store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations, improving efficiency.

The process also accounts for overlapping subsequences and handles cases where the first and last characters are the same, ensuring that we donâ€™t count the same subsequences multiple times.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Initialization**:
   - The problem is approached with the `countPalindromicSubsequences` function, which initializes a `memo` table to store results for subproblems.
   ```cpp
   int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
   int countPalindromicSubsequences(string s) {
       int n = s.size();
       vector<vector<int>> memo(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
       return dp(0, n - 1, memo, s);
   }
   ```

   - We define a constant `mod` to store the modulus value, \(10^9 + 7\), to prevent overflow and ensure the result fits within a standard integer limit.

2. **Recursive DP Function**:
   - The `dp` function is a recursive function that computes the number of palindromic subsequences between indices `i` and `j`.
   ```cpp
   int dp(int i, int j, vector<vector<int>> &memo, string &s) {
       if(i > j) return 0;
       if(i == j) return 1;
       if(memo[i][j] != 0) return memo[i][j];
   ```

   - **Base Cases**:
     - If `i > j`, the range is invalid, so the result is 0.
     - If `i == j`, there is only one character, which is always a palindrome of length 1.
     - If the result for the substring `s[i..j]` has already been computed (memoized), we return the stored result.

3. **Recursive Cases**:
   - If the characters at `i` and `j` are the same, we compute the number of palindromic subsequences by:
     - Doubling the result for the substring `s[i+1..j-1]`, as the current characters `s[i]` and `s[j]` can contribute to new palindromic subsequences.
     - Counting the left and right boundaries, adjusting for any overlapping subsequences that may have been counted more than once.
   ```cpp
   if(s[i] == s[j]) {
       ans = 2 * dp(i + 1, j - 1, memo, s);
       int left = i + 1, right = j - 1;
       while(left <= right && s[left] != s[i]) left++;
       while(left <= right && s[right] != s[i]) right--;
       if(left < right) ans -= dp(left + 1, right - 1, memo, s);
       else if(left == right) ans += 1;
       else ans += 2;
   } 
   ```

   - If the characters at `i` and `j` are different, we compute the result by:
     - Adding the number of palindromic subsequences for `s[i+1..j]` and `s[i..j-1]`, and subtracting the subsequences counted for `s[i+1..j-1]` (to avoid double counting).
   ```cpp
   else {
       ans = dp(i + 1, j, memo, s) + dp(i, j - 1, memo, s) - dp(i + 1, j - 1, memo, s);
   }
   ```

4. **Memoization and Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is stored in the memo table to avoid redundant calculations. Since the result can be large, we apply the modulo operation to ensure it stays within the limits of standard integer ranges.
   ```cpp
   return memo[i][j] = ans < 0 ? ans + mod : ans % mod;
   ```

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the result for the entire string is computed by calling `dp(0, n-1)`, which covers the entire range from the first to the last character of the string.
   
### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The function `dp(i, j)` is called recursively for each pair of indices `(i, j)`. Since we store the results in the `memo` table, each pair `(i, j)` is computed only once. Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n^2)**, where `n` is the length of the input string.
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is **O(n^2)**, as we use a `memo` table of size `n x n` to store intermediate results.

### Conclusion

This solution leverages dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently count the number of palindromic subsequences in a string, ensuring that overlapping subproblems are solved only once. By considering both the cases where the characters at the boundaries of the substring are the same and where they are different, the algorithm can compute the result without missing any palindromic subsequences.

The use of a modulo operation ensures that the result remains manageable even for larger strings. The time complexity of **O(n^2)** makes this solution feasible for moderate-sized input strings, and the space complexity is also **O(n^2)** due to the memoization table.

This approach is optimal for this problem, as it avoids the brute-force method of generating all subsequences, which would be computationally expensive, and instead uses the power of dynamic programming to break down the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems.

In summary, the solution provides an efficient and scalable way to count palindromic subsequences in a string using dynamic programming with memoization. The algorithm handles both base cases and recursive cases efficiently, ensuring that it performs well even for large input strings.
