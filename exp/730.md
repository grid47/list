### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, count the number of distinct palindromic subsequences in `s`.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
   - Use a 2D memoization table `memo` where `memo[i][j]` represents the number of distinct palindromic subsequences in the substring `s[i...j]`.

2. **Recursive Function**: 
   - Define a function `dp(i, j)` that calculates the number of palindromic subsequences in the substring from index `i` to `j`.
   - Base Cases:
     - If `i > j`, return 0 (invalid range).
     - If `i == j`, return 1 (a single character is a palindrome).
   - If `s[i] == s[j]`, the count is derived as follows:
     - Count palindromes formed by both characters: `2 * dp(i + 1, j - 1)`.
     - Handle duplicates:
       - Move left and right pointers to find the next occurrences of `s[i]`.
       - Adjust the count based on the positions of the left and right pointers.
   - If `s[i] != s[j]`, the count is the sum of:
     - `dp(i + 1, j)` (excluding the left character).
     - `dp(i, j - 1)` (excluding the right character).
     - Subtract `dp(i + 1, j - 1)` to avoid double-counting.

3. **Modulo Operation**: 
   - Use `mod = 1e9 + 7` to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains methods to solve the problem.
  - **Method**: 
    - `int countPalindromicSubsequences(string s)`: Initializes the memoization table and calls the DP function.
    - `int dp(int i, int j, vector<vector<int>> &memo, string &s)`: Implements the recursive logic to count palindromic subsequences.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2) for the DP table, where N is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N^2) for the memoization table.
