### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to determine whether the first player has a winning strategy in a game involving squares. The game is played as follows:

1. There is a pile of `n` stones.
2. Players take turns removing a perfect square number of stones from the pile (1, 4, 9, 16, etc.).
3. The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when there are no stones left) loses.

The objective is to determine if the first player can always win with optimal play from both players.

### Approach

The solution to this problem can be approached using dynamic programming. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` is `true` if the first player can win with `i` stones left, and `false` otherwise.

2. **Initialization**: The array is initialized with all values as `false`, representing the scenario where the first player cannot win with that number of stones.

3. **Iterate Through Possible Stone Counts**: For each stone count from 1 to `n`, check all possible square numbers (`k * k`) that can be removed.

4. **Winning Condition**: If there exists a move that leads to a state where the opponent cannot win (`dp[i - k * k]` is `false`), then the current state is winning for the first player (`dp[i] = true`).

5. **Final Result**: After filling the `dp` array, the answer for `n` stones will be in `dp[n]`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here’s a detailed explanation of the code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
```
- We define a class `Solution` with a public method `winnerSquareGame`.

```cpp
    bool winnerSquareGame(int n) {
```
- The method `winnerSquareGame` takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of stones.

```cpp
        vector<bool> dp(n + 1, false);
```
- We declare a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `n + 1`, initialized to `false`. This array will keep track of whether the first player can win with `i` stones.

```cpp
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
```
- We iterate from `1` to `n` to fill in the `dp` array.

```cpp
            for (int k = 1; k * k <= i; ++k) {
```
- For each `i`, we check all perfect squares `k * k` such that `k * k` is less than or equal to `i`.

```cpp
                if (!dp[i - k * k]) {
```
- We check if removing `k * k` stones leads to a state where the opponent cannot win (i.e., `dp[i - k * k]` is `false`).

```cpp
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
```
- If we find such a move, we mark `dp[i]` as `true` (indicating a winning state for the first player) and break out of the inner loop since we don't need to check further.

```cpp
            }
        }
```
- The loops continue until we have processed all possible stone counts.

```cpp
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
- Finally, we return `dp[n]`, which indicates whether the first player can win with `n` stones.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n \sqrt{n})\) because:
  - The outer loop runs \(n\) times.
  - The inner loop runs up to \(\sqrt{n}\) times for each `i`, as it iterates through the perfect squares.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the `dp` array used to store the winning states for each count of stones.

### Conclusion

This solution effectively determines the winner in the square game using dynamic programming principles. 

**Key Insights**:
- **Dynamic Programming**: This technique is applied to break down the problem into smaller subproblems, leveraging previously computed results to build up the final answer.
- **Game Theory**: The solution illustrates how to evaluate winning strategies in turn-based games, particularly those involving optimal moves and state transitions.

This algorithm can be very useful in competitive programming scenarios where similar game-based problems arise, providing a framework to analyze and solve problems involving states and transitions efficiently. The code is structured in a way that is easy to follow, and the logic can be applied to a variety of problems that require determining the outcome of competitive games.
