### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, find the sum of three integers such that the sum is closest to a given target. Return this sum.

### Approach
Use sorting combined with a two-pointer technique to efficiently find the closest sum of three integers.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Sort the input vector `nums` to enable the two-pointer technique.
   - Initialize `sum` with the sum of the first three elements and `sum1` to store the current sum of the triplet.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - Iterate through each element `nums[i]` in the sorted array:
     - Set `front` pointer to `i + 1` (next element).
     - Set `back` pointer to the last index of `nums`.

3. **Inner While Loop**:
   - Continue as long as `front` is less than `back`:
     - Calculate the current sum of the triplet: `sum1 = nums[front] + nums[back] + nums[i]`.
     - Check if the absolute difference between `sum1` and `target` is less than or equal to that of `sum` and `target`. If so, update `sum` to `sum1`.

4. **Adjust Pointers**:
   - If `sum1` is greater than `target`, decrement `back` to reduce the sum.
   - If `sum1` is less than `target`, increment `front` to increase the sum.
   - If `sum1` equals `target`, return `sum1` immediately since it is the closest possible sum.

5. **Return Result**:
   - After iterating through all possibilities, return the closest sum found in `sum`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\) - where \(n\) is the length of the input array, due to sorting and the nested loops.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) - no extra space is used apart from a few variables for indexing and storing sums.
