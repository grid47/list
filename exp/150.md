### Problem Statement
Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). The expression is given as a list of strings, where each string represents an integer or an operator.

### Approach
1. **Using Stack for Evaluation**:
   - Utilize a stack to keep track of numbers as they are processed.

2. **Iterate Through Tokens**:
   - For each token in the input vector:
     - If the token is a number, convert it to an integer and push it onto the stack.
     - If the token is an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`):
       - Pop the top two numbers from the stack.
       - Apply the operator to these numbers in the correct order (second popped number first).
       - Push the result back onto the stack.

3. **Return Final Result**:
   - The result of the expression will be the only remaining element in the stack after processing all tokens.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the `evalRPN` function, accepting a vector of strings as input.
- **Line 2**: Initialize a stack to hold integer values.
- **Line 3**: Get the number of tokens.
- **Line 4-16**: Iterate over each token:
  - **Line 5-8**: If the token is a number, convert and push it onto the stack.
  - **Line 9-15**: If the token is an operator:
    - Pop two operands from the stack.
    - Perform the operation based on the operator and push the result back onto the stack.
- **Line 17**: Return the top element of the stack, which contains the final result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of tokens, since each token is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\) in the worst case for the stack if all tokens are numbers.
