### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to evaluate an expression in **Reverse Polish Notation** (RPN). RPN is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. It eliminates the need for parentheses to define the order of operations and evaluates expressions from left to right. For example, the RPN expression `["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]` evaluates to `(2 + 1) * 3 = 9`.

We are given a list of strings representing the RPN expression, and we need to evaluate the expression and return the result. The valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, and the operands are integers.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can make use of a **stack**. The idea is to process each token in the RPN expression one by one:
1. If the token is a number, we push it onto the stack.
2. If the token is an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), we pop two operands from the stack, apply the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.
3. After processing all tokens, the stack will contain exactly one element, which is the final result.

This approach works because RPN processes operands before operators, which allows us to evaluate the expression in a single pass using a stack.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize the Stack and Iterate Over Tokens
```cpp
stack<int> stk;
int n = tokens.size();
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ...
}
```
We start by creating a stack `stk` to store intermediate results. We also determine the number of tokens in the expression by using `tokens.size()`.

#### Step 2: Process Each Token
```cpp
if(tokens[i] != "+" && tokens[i] != "-" && tokens[i] != "*" && tokens[i] != "/") {
    stk.push(stoi(tokens[i]));
} else {
    ...
}
```
For each token in the list:
- If the token is not one of the operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), it must be a number. We convert the string token to an integer using `stoi(tokens[i])` and push it onto the stack.
- If the token is an operator, we proceed to pop two numbers from the stack, apply the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.

#### Step 3: Handle Operators
```cpp
int x = stk.top(); stk.pop();
int y = stk.top(); stk.pop();

if(tokens[i] == "*") { stk.push(y * x); }
if(tokens[i] == "/") { stk.push(y / x); }
if(tokens[i] == "+") { stk.push(y + x); }
if(tokens[i] == "-") { stk.push(y - x); }
```
When we encounter an operator:
- We first pop the top two values from the stack. Since the stack operates on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, the first popped value `x` corresponds to the second operand, and the second popped value `y` corresponds to the first operand.
- Depending on the operator, we apply the operation:
  - For multiplication (`*`), we compute `y * x` and push the result back onto the stack.
  - For division (`/`), we compute `y / x` and push the result. In C++, integer division truncates toward zero.
  - For addition (`+`), we compute `y + x`.
  - For subtraction (`-`), we compute `y - x`.

#### Step 4: Return the Final Result
```cpp
return stk.top();
```
After processing all tokens, the stack will contain one element, which is the result of the expression. We return this element as the final result.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of tokens in the expression.
  - We process each token exactly once, either pushing it onto the stack (for numbers) or performing an operation (for operators). Each stack operation (push and pop) takes constant time, so the total time complexity is linear in the number of tokens.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of tokens.
  - In the worst case, the stack will contain all the operands (numbers) at once before any operators are applied. Therefore, the space complexity is proportional to the number of tokens in the input.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently evaluates an expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) using a stack. By iterating through the tokens and using the stack to store intermediate results, we can process each token in constant time, resulting in an overall time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of tokens. The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the use of the stack. 

This approach is optimal for evaluating RPN expressions because it directly models how RPN evaluates expressions: operands are pushed onto the stack, and operators apply to the operands that are already on the stack. Additionally, the solution correctly handles integer division, including truncation toward zero, as specified by the problem. This makes the solution both efficient and robust, suitable for a variety of RPN expressions.

### Additional Considerations

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The input tokens might contain a large number of numbers and operators, and the solution handles this by processing each token in linear time.
  - The solution handles division correctly by truncating toward zero, which is an important detail when working with integer division in programming.
  - The solution assumes valid input as per the problem constraints. If the input contains any invalid characters or tokens, the behavior is undefined, but for well-formed inputs, it will return the correct result.

- **Performance:** 
  - Given that the time complexity is `O(n)` and the space complexity is also `O(n)`, the algorithm is highly efficient for evaluating RPN expressions, even for large inputs.

This approach is a clear and concise way to evaluate RPN expressions and provides a solid foundation for solving similar problems that involve stack-based evaluations or postfix notation.
