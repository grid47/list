### Problem Statement
Write a function that determines if the usage of capitals in a given word follows these rules:
1. All letters in the word are uppercase.
2. All letters in the word are lowercase.
3. Only the first letter is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

### Approach
1. **Iterate through the word**:
   - Start from the second character (index 1) and check each character's case.
   
2. **Check Capitalization Rules**:
   - If the second character is uppercase, then all subsequent characters must also be uppercase.
   - If the first character is lowercase, then any uppercase character in the word invalidates the capitalization rule.
   - If both conditions fail, return `false`.

3. **Return Result**:
   - If none of the conditions fail during the iteration, return `true`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Loop**:
   - Loop from the second character to the end of the word.
   
2. **Conditional Checks**:
   - Use `isupper` and `islower` to determine the case of the characters.
   - Return `false` if the rules are violated.
   
3. **Final Return**:
   - If the loop completes without returning `false`, the capitalization is valid, so return `true`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the word, since we potentially check each character once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space for the character checks.
