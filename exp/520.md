### Problem Statement

The task is to determine whether a given string `word` uses capitalization correctly. According to the problem, a word is considered to have "correct capital usage" if one of the following conditions holds:

1. All letters in the word are capital letters (e.g., "USA").
2. All letters in the word are lowercase letters (e.g., "leetcode").
3. Only the first letter in the word is uppercase (e.g., "Google").

Given a string `word`, we need to return `true` if it satisfies one of these three conditions, and `false` otherwise.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string to check the capitalization usage. The code uses a straightforward logic to identify if the word violates any of the conditions. Here’s the plan:

1. **Check the Capitalization Pattern**: Starting from the second character (index `1`), we check if all the following characters match the case of the second character. This ensures that if the word is in all uppercase or all lowercase, we don’t have mixed cases after the first character.
2. **Verify the First Character Rule**: If the first character is lowercase, all subsequent characters must also be lowercase. If we encounter an uppercase letter in this scenario, it violates the capitalization rule, and we return `false`.

The code utilizes these checks to verify the correctness of capitalization in a single pass.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let’s break down the code step-by-step for a clearer understanding.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Loop

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i < word.size(); i++) {
```

The loop starts from index `1` and iterates through each character in `word`. This is because the first character is handled separately, and we only need to check subsequent characters to verify capitalization consistency.

#### Step 2: Check Capitalization Consistency

```cpp
if (isupper(word[1]) != isupper(word[i]) ||
    islower(word[0]) && isupper(word[i])) 
    return false;
```

The condition is designed to detect incorrect capitalization patterns in the word. Let’s analyze it part by part:

- **`isupper(word[1]) != isupper(word[i])`**: This part checks if the case of the first character after the initial letter (i.e., `word[1]`) matches the case of the current character, `word[i]`. If they don’t match, it implies that the capitalization is inconsistent.
  
- **`islower(word[0]) && isupper(word[i])`**: This part checks if the first character is lowercase and any subsequent character is uppercase. If this is the case, the word doesn’t adhere to the rule where all characters should be lowercase when the first character is lowercase.

If either of these two conditions is met, the function returns `false` as the capitalization usage is incorrect.

#### Step 3: Return True for Valid Capitalization

```cpp
return true;
```

If the loop completes without triggering the `return false` condition, it means the word meets one of the required capitalization conditions, so the function returns `true`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this function is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `word`. This is because we perform a single pass over the string, checking each character’s case and comparing it with the expected pattern.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we only use a few variables for temporary storage and perform checks directly on the input string.

### Conclusion

This solution provides an efficient way to validate the capitalization usage of a word according to the rules provided. By leveraging the `isupper()` and `islower()` functions, the code quickly identifies any deviation from the three acceptable capitalization patterns. The solution is both time-efficient, due to its single-pass approach, and space-efficient, as it requires only constant space.

This approach is ideal for real-time applications where we need to validate capitalization quickly, especially when working with user-generated text inputs in forms or user interfaces. The solution is simple, efficient, and adheres to industry standards for checking case consistency in strings.
