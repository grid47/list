### Problem Statement
The problem requires transforming an integer array `arr1` into a strictly increasing array. You can achieve this by replacing any element in `arr1` with an element from another array `arr` as many times as needed. The goal is to determine the minimum number of replacements required to make `arr1` strictly increasing. If it is impossible to do so, return -1.

For instance, given `arr1 = [1,5,3]` and `arr = [1,2,3,4]`, the minimal transformation could result in `[1,2,4]`, requiring two replacements. The solution must efficiently handle large inputs and determine the fewest replacements needed.

### Approach
The solution employs dynamic programming and binary search techniques to efficiently track the number of replacements needed while checking for strictly increasing conditions. A memoization table is used to store previously computed states, thereby avoiding redundant calculations.

1. **Sort the Replacement Array**: The array `arr` is sorted to facilitate efficient lookups using binary search.
2. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**: The function `dp` computes the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray increasing from the current index `i` and position `j` in the sorted array.
3. **State Management**: The state is represented by the current index in `arr1`, the index in `arr`, and a boolean indicating whether the last used value came from `arr` or `arr1`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> arr1;
    vector<int> arr;
    int memo[2001][2001][2];
```
- **Lines 1-4**: The `Solution` class is defined, and member variables are declared. Two vectors, `arr1` and `arr`, store the input arrays, while a 3D memoization array `memo` tracks results for dynamic programming states.

```cpp
    int dp(int i, int j, bool master) {
        if(i >= arr1.size()) return 0;
```
- **Lines 5-7**: The recursive function `dp` is defined. If the index `i` exceeds the size of `arr1`, it returns 0, indicating that no more replacements are needed.

```cpp
        int prv = master? ((i == 0)? INT_MIN: arr1[i - 1]): arr[j];        
        j = upper_bound(arr.begin() + j, arr.end(), prv) - arr.begin();        
```
- **Lines 8-10**: The variable `prv` is set to the last used value, which depends on whether the last chosen element was from `arr1` (`master` is `true`) or `arr` (`master` is `false`). The binary search function `upper_bound` is used to find the first element in `arr` greater than `prv`, allowing efficient management of the next candidate for replacement.

```cpp
        if(memo[i][j][master] != -1) return memo[i][j][master];
```
- **Line 11**: The function checks if the current state has already been computed. If so, it returns the stored value from `memo`.

```cpp
        int ans = 2001;
        if(j < arr.size()) ans = dp(i + 1, j, false) + 1;
```
- **Lines 12-14**: The variable `ans` is initialized to a high value (greater than any possible number of replacements). If there are elements left in `arr`, it recursively calls `dp`, attempting to replace the current element in `arr1` with an element from `arr`, incrementing the count of replacements.

```cpp
        if(prv < arr1[i]) ans = min(ans, dp(i + 1, j, true));
```
- **Line 15**: If the last value `prv` is less than the current value in `arr1`, it checks if we can keep the current value and proceed, updating `ans` with the minimum replacements needed.

```cpp
        return memo[i][j][master] = ans;
    }
```
- **Line 16**: The computed result for the current state is stored in `memo` before returning it.

```cpp
    int makeArrayIncreasing(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr) {
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        this->arr1 = arr1;
        this->arr = arr;
```
- **Lines 18-21**: The main function `makeArrayIncreasing` begins. It sorts the replacement array `arr` and initializes the member vectors `arr1` and `arr` with the provided inputs.

```cpp
        memset(memo, -1, sizeof(memo));
        int ans= dp(0, 0, true);
        return ans >= 2001? -1: ans;
    }
};
```
- **Lines 22-25**: The memoization table is initialized to -1 to indicate that no states have been computed yet. The `dp` function is called starting with the first index of `arr1` and `arr`, with `master` set to `true`. Finally, it checks if the result is still at the initialized high value, returning -1 if it is impossible to create a strictly increasing array, or returning the computed answer otherwise.

### Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**: 
   - The algorithm's time complexity is \(O(n \cdot m \log m)\), where \(n\) is the size of `arr1` and \(m\) is the size of `arr`. The sorting step takes \(O(m \log m)\), and each dynamic programming state can involve a binary search.

2. **Space Complexity**: 
   - The space complexity is \(O(n \cdot m)\) due to the memoization table, which stores the results of all possible states.

### Conclusion
The `makeArrayIncreasing` function provides an effective solution to the problem of transforming an integer array into a strictly increasing one using minimal replacements from another array. By employing dynamic programming and efficient searching techniques, this solution optimally balances performance and clarity. The use of memoization ensures that the function handles larger inputs smoothly, making it a robust choice for tackling similar transformation problems in arrays. The strategic use of the binary search allows quick determination of suitable replacements, while the clear structure of the code facilitates understanding and maintenance.
