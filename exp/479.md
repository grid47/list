### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, you need to find the largest palindrome made from the product of two `n`-digit numbers. Return the result modulo `1337`.

### Approach
1. **Understanding Palindromes**:
   - A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.

2. **Defining the Range**:
   - For `n`-digit numbers, the upper limit is \(10^n - 1\) and the lower limit is \(10^{(n-1)}\).

3. **Building Palindromes**:
   - Start from the largest `n`-digit number and generate candidate palindromes by reflecting the digits.

4. **Checking for Products**:
   - For each candidate palindrome, check if it can be expressed as a product of two `n`-digit numbers. 
   - This is done by iterating through potential factors from the upper limit down to the lower limit.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - If a valid palindrome product is found, return it modulo `1337`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `largestPalindrome()` takes an integer `n` as input.

2. **Calculating Upper and Lower Bounds**:
   - `upper` is set to \(10^n - 1\) and `lower` to \(10^{(n-1)}\).

3. **Generating Palindromes**:
   - Loop from `upper` down to `lower` to build potential palindromes using the `buildPalindrome()` helper function.

4. **Checking Factorization**:
   - For each generated palindrome, check if it can be factorized into two `n`-digit numbers by iterating through possible factors.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the result modulo `1337` when a valid palindrome product is found.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst case, due to the nested loops for generating palindromes and checking their factors.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since only a constant amount of space is used for variables.
