### Problem Statement

The task is to find the largest palindrome that can be obtained by multiplying two `n`-digit numbers. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. Given `n`, the goal is to determine this largest palindrome and return it modulo `1337`. If `n` is 1, then the result is simply `9`, as this is the largest single-digit palindrome. For other values of `n`, we need to find two `n`-digit numbers whose product forms the largest palindrome.

### Approach

The approach to solving this problem involves a combination of reverse engineering palindromes and efficiently searching for factors. Instead of checking every possible product of two `n`-digit numbers to see if it forms a palindrome, we generate potential palindromic candidates directly and then verify if these candidates can be obtained by multiplying two `n`-digit numbers.

1. **Handle Small Case for `n = 1`**: When `n` is 1, the largest palindrome is simply `9`, as this is the largest product of two single-digit numbers.

2. **Generate `n`-Digit Bounds**: For any `n`, the largest `n`-digit number, `upper`, is given by `10^n - 1`, and the smallest `n`-digit number, `lower`, is `10^(n-1)`. These values help to define the range within which we search for factors.

3. **Loop to Create Palindromic Candidates**:
   - For each number `i` starting from `upper` and decrementing to `lower`, we generate a palindromic candidate using the `buildPalindrome` function. This function takes `i` and mirrors it to form a palindrome.
   - For instance, if `i = 123`, the function creates the string `"123321"`, which is a palindromic number.

4. **Check for Valid Factors**:
   - Once we have a palindrome candidate, we loop through potential divisors `j` starting from `upper` down to `sqrt(cand)`. If `j * j` becomes smaller than the candidate, we stop, as there can’t be any valid divisors larger than `sqrt(cand)` left.
   - For each `j`, we check if `j` divides `cand`. If it does, we verify that the quotient of `cand / j` is also an `n`-digit number (i.e., it does not exceed `upper`). If both conditions are met, we’ve found the largest palindrome, so we return it modulo `1337`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let’s walk through each part of the code in detail:

1. **Special Case for `n = 1`**:
   ```cpp
   if (n == 1) return 9;
   ```
   Here, we check if `n` is 1. If it is, we directly return 9, as that’s the largest single-digit palindrome.

2. **Set Bounds for `n`-Digit Numbers**:
   ```cpp
   int upper = pow(10, n) - 1;
   int lower = pow(10, n-1);
   ```
   We define `upper` as the largest `n`-digit number (e.g., for `n = 2`, `upper = 99`) and `lower` as the smallest `n`-digit number (e.g., for `n = 2`, `lower = 10`).

3. **Loop to Create and Check Palindromic Candidates**:
   ```cpp
   for (int i = upper; i >= lower; i--) {
       long cand = buildPalindrome(i);
   ```
   Here, we iterate from `upper` down to `lower` and generate a palindromic candidate for each `i` using the `buildPalindrome` function.

4. **Function to Build a Palindrome**:
   ```cpp
   long buildPalindrome(int n) {
       string s = to_string(n);
       reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
       return stol(to_string(n) + s);
   }
   ```
   This helper function takes an integer `n`, converts it to a string, and reverses it to create a mirrored palindrome. The resulting string is then converted back to a long integer to be used as a palindromic candidate.

5. **Check for Valid Divisors**:
   ```cpp
   for (long j = upper; j * j >= cand; j--) {
       if (cand % j == 0 && cand / j <= upper) {
           return cand % 1337;
       }
   }
   ```
   For each palindrome candidate `cand`, we check for divisors starting from `upper`. If `j` divides `cand` and `cand / j` is an `n`-digit number, we’ve found the largest valid palindrome, and we return `cand % 1337`.

6. **Return Default**:
   ```cpp
   return -1;
   ```
   If no palindrome is found (which theoretically shouldn’t happen), we return `-1`.

### Complexity

The time and space complexity of this solution can be analyzed as follows:

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity is roughly **O(upper^2)**. For each potential palindrome candidate, we loop through divisors up to `upper`. Although the complexity is quadratic, the constraints ensure that the performance is manageable for small values of `n`.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we use only a few variables to store the palindrome candidate and divisor.

### Conclusion

In summary, this solution is an efficient approach to finding the largest palindrome that can be represented as the product of two `n`-digit numbers. By generating palindromic candidates directly and validating their factors, we avoid unnecessary computations, making this a well-optimized solution for the problem at hand. The approach of building palindromic candidates and verifying divisors is both intuitive and efficient, leveraging mathematical properties to produce a robust solution.
