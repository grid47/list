### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and a list of words, determine how many words from the list are subsequences of `s`.

### Approach
1. **Character Indexing**:
   - Create a vector of vectors (`srch`) where each vector corresponds to a character ('a' to 'z') and contains the indices of that character's occurrences in string `s`.

2. **Subsequence Check**:
   - For each word in the list, iterate through its characters.
   - For each character, use binary search (`upper_bound`) to find the first occurrence in `s` that comes after the last matched index. If a character cannot be found, the word is not a subsequence.

3. **Counting Matches**:
   - If all characters of a word are found in the correct order, increment the result count.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to count the matching subsequences.
    - `int numMatchingSubseq(string s, vector<string>& words)`: Main function that performs the counting of subsequences.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `s`: The string in which to check for subsequences.
        - `words`: A list of words to check against `s`.
      - **Returns**: The count of words that are subsequences of `s`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + w * m log n), where:
  - \(n\) is the length of string `s`.
  - \(w\) is the number of words.
  - \(m\) is the average length of the words, due to the binary search for each character in `s`.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where \(n\) is the size of the indexing vector used to store occurrences of each character in `s`.
