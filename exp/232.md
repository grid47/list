### Problem Statement
Implement a queue using two stacks. The queue should support standard operations: push, pop, peek, and empty.

### Approach
This implementation leverages two stacks (`s1` and `s2`) to mimic queue operations. Elements are pushed into `s1`, while `s2` is used to reverse the order of elements to achieve FIFO behavior.

1. **Push Operation**: Push the element directly into `s1`.
2. **Pop Operation**: If `s2` is empty, transfer all elements from `s1` to `s2` to reverse the order, then pop the top of `s2`.
3. **Peek Operation**: Similar to `pop`, transfer elements from `s1` to `s2` if `s2` is empty, and return the top of `s2` without removing it.
4. **Empty Check**: The queue is empty if both `s1` and `s2` are empty.

### Code Walk-through

- **Constructor** initializes two stacks, `s1` and `s2`.
- **push(x)** pushes `x` into `s1`.
- **pop()** checks if `s2` is empty, and if so, transfers all elements from `s1` to `s2` before removing the top of `s2`.
- **peek()** checks if `s2` is empty, and if so, transfers all elements from `s1` to `s2` before returning the top of `s2`.
- **empty()** returns true if both `s1` and `s2` are empty.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **push**: \(O(1)\)
  - **pop**: Amortized \(O(1)\) since each element is moved at most once between stacks.
  - **peek**: Amortized \(O(1)\)
  - **empty**: \(O(1)\)
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the queue, as each element is stored in either `s1` or `s2`.
