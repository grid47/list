### Problem Statement
The objective is to mask personally identifiable information (PII) from a given string, which can either be an email address or a phone number.

### Approach
1. **Email Masking**: If the input string contains an '@' character, it is identified as an email address. The transformation involves:
   - Converting the entire email to lowercase.
   - Retaining the first character and the domain (after the '@'), while masking the middle part with five asterisks.
   
2. **Phone Number Masking**: If the input does not contain an '@', it is treated as a phone number. The steps include:
   - Removing all non-digit characters using a regular expression.
   - Using a predefined format to determine the country code based on the number of digits:
     - If there are 10 digits, format as `***-***-XXXX`.
     - If there are more digits, prefix the number with a country code while masking the remaining digits.

### Code Walk-through
- The `country` vector defines the formatting for phone numbers based on their lengths.
- For email addresses, the result is constructed by concatenating the first character, asterisks, and the last part of the email.
- For phone numbers, non-numeric characters are stripped, and the appropriate masked format is returned based on the total digit count.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the input string, as we need to iterate through the string for masking.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the constant space used by the `country` vector.
