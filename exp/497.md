### Problem Statement
Design a data structure that generates a random point in a set of non-overlapping rectangles. Each rectangle is defined by its bottom-left and top-right corners, and you need to ensure that the points are uniformly distributed across all rectangles.

### Approach
1. **Precompute Areas**:
   - Calculate the area of each rectangle and maintain a cumulative area in a vector `v`. This helps in determining the probability distribution of selecting points from each rectangle.

2. **Random Selection**:
   - Use a random number generator to pick a number from the cumulative area vector.
   - Determine which rectangle the random number falls into using binary search (`upper_bound`).
   - Randomly select a point within the chosen rectangle.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The `area()` function calculates the area of a rectangle given its coordinates.
   - The `Solution` constructor initializes the rectangles and precomputes the cumulative areas.
   - The `pick()` function generates a random point based on the cumulative distribution.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Class Definition**:
   - The `Solution` class contains:
     - A vector `v` to store cumulative areas.
     - A vector `rect` to store rectangle coordinates.

2. **Area Calculation**:
   - The `area(vector<int> r)` function calculates the area of a rectangle defined by the corners provided.

3. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor initializes the rectangles and computes the cumulative areas.

4. **Point Picking**:
   - The `pick()` function generates a random integer within the range of the total area and finds the corresponding rectangle.
   - It then randomly generates a point within the selected rectangle.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - **Initialization**: O(n), where n is the number of rectangles for building the cumulative area vector.
  - **Pick Operation**: O(log n) for the binary search to find the rectangle based on the cumulative area.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the cumulative area vector.
