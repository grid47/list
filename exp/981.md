### Problem Statement
Implement a `TimeMap` class that can store a key-value pair along with a timestamp. The class should support setting values with timestamps and retrieving values based on the given timestamp, returning the most recent value for a timestamp that is less than or equal to the given one.

### Approach
1. **Data Structure**: Use a `map<string, vector<pair<int, string>>>` to store values. Each key maps to a vector of timestamp-value pairs.
2. **Setting Values**: For each `set` call, insert the `(timestamp, value)` pair into the vector associated with the `key`.
3. **Retrieving Values**: For each `get` call, use binary search on the vector to find the latest timestamp that is less than or equal to the specified `timestamp`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **`set` Method**:
   - Insert `(timestamp, value)` into the vector for the given `key`.
   
2. **`get` Method**:
   - If the `key` does not exist in the map, return an empty string.
   - Perform binary search on the vector of timestamp-value pairs:
     - If `timestamp` matches a value, return it.
     - Otherwise, return the value with the largest timestamp less than or equal to `timestamp`.
   
### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - `set` operation: O(1), since it simply appends to a vector.
  - `get` operation: O(log n), due to binary search on the timestamps.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of unique `set` operations across all keys.
