### Problem Statement
The task is to determine the minimum number of rotations needed to make all the values in two stacks of dominoes uniform, meaning that both stacks will have the same number on each domino. Each domino has two numbers, one on the top and one on the bottom. A rotation of a domino swaps its top and bottom numbers. Our goal is to identify the least number of such rotations required to achieve uniformity. If it's not possible to achieve uniformity, the function should return -1.

### Approach
To tackle this problem, we can utilize counting strategies to track the occurrences of each number on both stacks. The main idea is to:
1. Count how many times each number appears in both the top and bottom stacks.
2. Determine the valid numbers that can potentially make both stacks uniform. 
3. Calculate the minimum rotations required for these valid numbers to ensure that either all top numbers or all bottom numbers are the same.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `minDominoRotations` is defined as a public member of the `Solution` class. It takes two vectors of integers, `top` and `bottom`, representing the numbers on the top and bottom of the dominoes.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - We create a map `mp` to store counts of how many times each number appears across both stacks.
   - Two vectors, `tc` and `uc`, both of size 7 (to account for domino numbers 1 through 6), are initialized to track the counts of top and bottom numbers, respectively.
   - We also capture the size of the input arrays with `n`, which represents the total number of dominoes.

3. **Counting Domino Numbers**:
   - A `for` loop iterates through each index `i` of the dominoes:
     - If the numbers on the top and bottom differ (`bottom[i] != top[i]`), we increment the count for both the top and bottom numbers in the map `mp`.
     - If they are the same, we only increment the count for the number found in the top stack.
     - Regardless, we also update the count of occurrences in `uc` (for bottom numbers) and `tc` (for top numbers).

4. **Identifying Valid Numbers**:
   - A vector `opt` is created to hold valid numbers that could potentially make both stacks uniform. 
   - We iterate over the entries in the map `mp`:
     - If the count of a number equals `n`, it indicates that the number is present in all dominoes (either top or bottom) and is added to `opt`.

5. **Handle Cases with No Valid Number**:
   - If the `opt` vector is empty, meaning no number can make the stacks uniform, we return -1.

6. **Calculating Minimum Rotations**:
   - We initialize `res` to `INT_MAX`, which will store the minimum rotations found.
   - We then loop over each number `x` in the `opt` vector:
     - If the count of `x` in either `uc` or `tc` is equal to `n`, we can achieve uniformity without any rotations, so we return 0.
     - Otherwise, we calculate the number of rotations needed to convert all occurrences of the other number to `x` using the formulas `n - uc[x]` and `n - tc[x]` and update `res` accordingly.

7. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, we return the minimum rotations stored in `res`.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this function is O(n) since we make a single pass through the dominoes to count the occurrences and another pass through the potential valid numbers to calculate the minimum rotations. Thus, the algorithm is efficient and scalable with respect to input size.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) in terms of additional data structures, as the size of `mp`, `tc`, and `uc` remains constant (limited to numbers 1 to 6). Therefore, our memory usage does not grow with `n`.

### Conclusion
The `minDominoRotations` function provides an efficient solution to the problem of determining the minimum number of rotations needed to achieve uniformity in stacks of dominoes. By leveraging counting techniques and managing occurrences of each number systematically, the algorithm successfully identifies valid candidates for uniformity and calculates the required rotations. The method is both time-efficient and straightforward, making it a valuable approach for similar problems that involve combinations or arrangements with constraints.

This implementation illustrates how to effectively utilize maps and vectors to track and manage state, which is crucial in solving problems involving multiple data sets. Understanding this solution can help in approaching a variety of algorithmic challenges where the goal is to manipulate and analyze collections of data efficiently. The logic used here can be adapted to broader contexts in competitive programming, coding interviews, and algorithm design tasks.
