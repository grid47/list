### Problem Statement
The task is to determine the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index of an array, where each element in the array represents the maximum jump length from that position.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with a variable `jumps` to count the number of jumps made.
   - Use `cur` to track the current furthest reachable index.
   - Use `far` to keep track of the furthest index that can be reached at the current jump level.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - Loop through the elements of the array except the last one (since no jump is needed from the last index).
   - Update `far` with the maximum index that can be reached from the current index (`i + nums[i]`).

3. **Check for Jump Necessity**:
   - If the current index `i` reaches the `cur` index, it indicates that a jump must be made to reach further:
     - Increment the `jumps` counter.
     - Update `cur` to `far`, indicating the next furthest position reachable with the new jump.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - After exiting the loop, return the `jumps` count.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `jump` function accepts a vector of integers `nums`.

2. **Variables**:
   - `jumps`: Counts the total number of jumps needed.
   - `cur`: The current end of the range that can be reached with the current number of jumps.
   - `far`: The furthest index reachable with the next jump.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop runs until the second-to-last index. It calculates the maximum reachable index (`far`) and updates `cur` when necessary.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`, since we traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we use only a constant amount of extra space for variables.
