### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to construct a **Maximum Binary Tree** from a given list of integers. In this tree:
- The root is the maximum value in the list.
- The left subtree is the maximum binary tree for the elements to the left of the maximum value.
- The right subtree is the maximum binary tree for the elements to the right of the maximum value.

Given a list of integers, we need to return the root of the maximum binary tree constructed from these elements. 

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize a **monotonic stack**. The basic idea is to iterate through the list of numbers, creating a binary tree where each node is constructed from the elements in the list based on their relative values. The stack helps to keep track of the nodes in the tree as we find the next largest number and build the tree in a way that respects the maximum value being the root of subtrees.

The process involves iterating through the list, constructing nodes, and using the stack to correctly assign left and right children while ensuring that the tree adheres to the maximum binary tree properties. Specifically, the algorithm will:
1. Use a stack to maintain the nodes as we iterate through the list.
2. For each number, check if it is larger than the top of the stack. If so, pop the stack and make the current number the left child of the popped node.
3. Attach the current number as the right child of the node on the stack if necessary.
4. At the end of the iteration, the first node in the stack will be the root of the tree.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. **TreeNode Definition**:

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};
```
- A `TreeNode` structure is defined to represent each node in the binary tree. Each node contains a value (`val`), a left child (`left`), and a right child (`right`). The constructor initializes these properties.

#### 2. **Main Function (constructMaximumBinaryTree)**:

```cpp
TreeNode* constructMaximumBinaryTree(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<TreeNode*> stk;
    
    for(int num : nums) {
        TreeNode* cur = new TreeNode(num);
        
        while(!stk.empty() && stk.back()->val < num) {
            cur->left = stk.back();
            stk.pop_back();
        }
        
        if(!stk.empty()) stk.back()->right = cur;
        
        stk.push_back(cur);
    }
    
    return stk.front();
}
```

- **`stk`**: This is a vector that acts as a stack to keep track of the nodes as we iterate through the list.
- **Loop through each number**: We iterate over the `nums` array to create a new `TreeNode` for each number.
  
#### 3. **Handling Smaller Numbers**:

```cpp
while(!stk.empty() && stk.back()->val < num) {
    cur->left = stk.back();
    stk.pop_back();
}
```
- **Condition**: This `while` loop checks if the top node of the stack has a value less than the current number (`num`). If it does, it means the current number should be the root of a new subtree, and we need to make the top node the left child of the current node.
- We pop the stack and attach the popped node as the left child of the current node (`cur`).

#### 4. **Attaching Right Child**:

```cpp
if(!stk.empty()) stk.back()->right = cur;
```
- If there are still nodes left in the stack after the `while` loop, it means the current node (`cur`) is smaller than the node at the top of the stack, and thus should be the right child of that node.

#### 5. **Push Current Node onto Stack**:

```cpp
stk.push_back(cur);
```
- We push the current node onto the stack so that it can potentially be used as the left or right child of a future node as we continue to iterate through the list.

#### 6. **Return the Root Node**:

```cpp
return stk.front();
```
- After all nodes are processed, the root of the tree will be the first node in the stack. This is because, by the end of the iteration, the last node will have become the root, and all other nodes will be appropriately attached as left or right children.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. Each node is pushed onto and popped from the stack at most once, resulting in **O(n)** operations for each element.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(n)**, as the stack stores all `n` nodes in the worst case. Additionally, the space used by the tree nodes is also **O(n)**, as we are constructing the entire tree.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently constructs the **Maximum Binary Tree** using a stack-based approach. The algorithm ensures that each element in the input list is processed in linear time, with each node being added to and removed from the stack exactly once. This results in an optimal **O(n)** time complexity, making the solution well-suited for large input sizes. The space complexity is also linear due to the stack and tree node storage.

The approach effectively constructs the maximum binary tree by leveraging the properties of the maximum binary tree and using a stack to manage the relationship between nodes. This solution is easy to understand and provides a concise way to solve the problem with optimal time and space complexities.
