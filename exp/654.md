### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, construct a maximum binary tree. The maximum binary tree is defined as follows:
1. The root is the maximum number in the array.
2. The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from the elements to the left of the maximum number.
3. The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from the elements to the right of the maximum number.

### Approach
1. **Stack Utilization**:
   - Use a stack to keep track of the nodes as we iterate through the array. This helps manage the relationships between parent and child nodes effectively.

2. **Iterative Construction**:
   - For each number in the array:
     - Create a new tree node.
     - While the stack is not empty and the value at the top of the stack is less than the current number, set the left child of the new node to the node popped from the stack (this establishes the left subtree relationship).
     - If the stack is not empty after this, set the right child of the top node on the stack to the new node (this establishes the right subtree relationship).
     - Finally, push the new node onto the stack.

3. **Final Tree Root**:
   - At the end of the iteration, the first node in the stack will be the root of the maximum binary tree.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a vector of pointers to hold the tree nodes.

2. **Node Creation and Relationships**:
   - For each number, a new node is created, and the relationships with existing nodes are adjusted based on the maximum value rules.

3. **Return the Root**:
   - The root of the tree is the first element in the stack, which will be returned.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the `nums` array. Each element is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for the stack that holds the tree nodes during construction.
