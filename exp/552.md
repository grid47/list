### Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `n`, representing the number of attendance records for a student, you need to find the number of valid attendance records of length `n` that satisfy the following conditions:
1. A student can be absent ('A') at most once.
2. A student can be late ('L') at most twice in a row.
3. Any attendance record must not contain "LLL" (three consecutive late days).

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
   - Use a recursive function with memoization to store intermediate results, which will help in avoiding redundant calculations.
   - Define `dp(idx, a, l)` where:
     - `idx` is the current position in the attendance string.
     - `a` is the count of absences encountered so far.
     - `l` is the count of consecutive late arrivals.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If `idx` equals `n`, check if the counts of absences and late arrivals meet the conditions:
     - Return 1 if valid; otherwise, return 0.
   - If the number of absences `a` is 2 or the count of late arrivals `l` is 3, return 0 (invalid record).

3. **Recursion**:
   - Consider the following cases:
     - Not adding 'A' (increase the index, reset late count).
     - Adding 'A' (increase absence count, reset late count).
     - Adding 'L' (increase late count, but only if it is less than 2).
   - Combine results from the above scenarios to get the total number of valid records.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result could be large, take results modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code Walk-through
- The `checkRecord` function initializes the DP memoization structure and calls the recursive `dp` function.
- The `dp` function implements the base cases, checks for valid states, and recursively calculates the number of valid records based on attendance patterns.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * 3 * 4) = O(n), as we memoize the results based on 3 absences and 4 late counts.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the memoization table.
