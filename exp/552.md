### Problem Statement
The problem involves counting the number of valid attendance records for a student over `n` days, where each day can have one of three possible states: 'A' (Absent), 'L' (Late), or 'P' (Present). The goal is to find the number of valid attendance strings where:
- The student can be absent at most once.
- The student can be late at most twice in a row.

The result must be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\), a large prime number to ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.

### Approach
The problem can be solved efficiently using **dynamic programming (DP)** with memoization. The idea is to use a 3D DP table to track the number of valid attendance strings, where each state represents:
1. The current day (`idx`).
2. The number of absences (`a`).
3. The number of consecutive lates (`l`).

We solve the problem by recursively exploring all valid attendance choices for each day and memoizing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. **Class Definition and Data Members**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int n;
    vector<vector<vector<int>>> mem;
    int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
```
- `n`: This represents the number of days for which we need to compute the valid attendance records.
- `mem`: A 3D vector that stores the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. The dimensions are `[n+1][3][4]`:
  - `n+1`: Tracks all days from `0` to `n`.
  - `3`: Tracks the number of absences (`a`), where `a` ranges from 0 to 2.
  - `4`: Tracks the number of consecutive late days (`l`), where `l` ranges from 0 to 3 (because more than 2 consecutive late days is invalid).
- `mod`: A constant representing the modulus value, \(10^9 + 7\), used to keep the results within bounds.

#### 2. **Dynamic Programming Recursive Function**
```cpp
int dp(int idx, int a, int l) {
    if(idx == n) return l != 3 && a != 2;  // Base case: if we reached the last day, check if valid
```
- **Base Case**: If `idx == n`, it means we've processed all `n` days. We return `1` if the attendance record is valid, i.e., the number of absences (`a`) is less than 2 and the number of consecutive late days (`l`) is less than 3. Otherwise, we return `0`.

```cpp
    if(a >= 2 || l >= 3) return 0;  // If we exceed the allowed absences or late days, return 0
```
- If the number of absences (`a`) is greater than or equal to 2, or the number of consecutive late days (`l`) is greater than or equal to 3, the record is invalid, so we return `0`.

```cpp
    if(mem[idx][a][l] != -1) return mem[idx][a][l];  // Memoization: if already computed, return stored value
```
- **Memoization**: If the result for the current state (`idx`, `a`, `l`) has already been computed, return the stored value to avoid redundant calculations.

#### 3. **Recursion for Attendance Choices**
```cpp
    long ans = dp(idx + 1, a, 0) % mod + dp(idx + 1, a + 1, 0) % mod;  // Present or Absent
```
- **Present ('P')**: We can choose 'P' for the current day. This resets the count of consecutive late days (`l = 0`).
- **Absent ('A')**: We can also choose 'A' if we haven't exceeded the allowed absences (`a + 1`). This also resets the count of consecutive late days (`l = 0`).

```cpp
    if(l < 2) ans += dp(idx + 1, a, l + 1) % mod;  // Late ('L') if we haven't exceeded 2 consecutive lates
```
- **Late ('L')**: If the number of consecutive late days (`l`) is less than 2, we can choose 'L'. This increments the consecutive late count (`l + 1`).

#### 4. **Memoize and Return Result**
```cpp
    return mem[idx][a][l] = ans % mod;  // Store the result and return it
}
```
- Store the computed result for the current state in `mem[idx][a][l]` and return it. The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to keep it within bounds.

#### 5. **Check Record Function**
```cpp
int checkRecord(int n) {
    this-> n = n;  // Set the number of days
    mem.resize(n + 1, vector<vector<int>>(3, vector<int>(4, -1)));  // Initialize memoization table
    return dp(0, 0, 0);  // Start from the first day with 0 absents and 0 consecutive lates
}
```
- **`checkRecord(n)`**: This is the main function that initializes the necessary parameters:
  - Sets the number of days `n`.
  - Resizes the `mem` table to fit the required dimensions (`n+1`, `3`, `4`).
  - Calls the `dp` function starting from `idx = 0` (the first day), with `a = 0` (no absents yet), and `l = 0` (no consecutive late days yet).

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is dominated by the recursive calls and memoization.
- The total number of distinct states in the `mem` table is approximately `(n+1) * 3 * 4 = 12n`.
- Each state is computed only once, and each computation involves a constant amount of work (calculating three possible transitions).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of days.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is dominated by the `mem` table, which has dimensions `(n+1) x 3 x 4`. This requires **O(n)** space.
- The recursion depth can go up to `O(n)` due to the recursive calls in the `dp` function.
- Thus, the space complexity is **O(n)**.

### Conclusion
This solution efficiently computes the number of valid attendance records for a student over `n` days using dynamic programming with memoization. By breaking down the problem into subproblems (each representing a specific configuration of day index, absences, and consecutive lates), we can compute the solution in linear time relative to `n`.

The memoization ensures that each subproblem is solved only once, making the solution both time and space efficient. The result is returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is common in competitive programming to prevent overflow issues.

The approach is optimal for solving problems that involve counting valid sequences or paths under certain constraints, as it reduces the problem's complexity from exponential to linear time. The dynamic programming strategy used here is versatile and can be applied to other similar problems where states depend on previous decisions.
