### Problem Statement

The problem is to find the nth digit in the sequence of positive integers. The sequence starts from 1 and continues with numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 10, 11, 12, ..., and so on. Given a positive integer `n`, the goal is to determine the nth digit in this infinitely growing sequence. For example, if `n = 11`, the sequence looks like `123456789101112...`, and the 11th digit is `0`.

### Approach

This problem can be solved by identifying the range in which the nth digit lies and calculating it without constructing the entire sequence explicitly. 

#### Key Observations:
1. **Increasing Number Lengths**:
   - Numbers in the sequence consist of different digit lengths:
     - 1-digit numbers: `1 to 9` (9 numbers)
     - 2-digit numbers: `10 to 99` (90 numbers)
     - 3-digit numbers: `100 to 999` (900 numbers)
     - And so on.
   - The total number of digits contributed by `k`-digit numbers is `k * 9 * 10^(k-1)`. For instance, there are `9 * 1` digits from 1-digit numbers, `90 * 2` digits from 2-digit numbers, and so on.

2. **Breaking Down the Problem**:
   - We need to identify which group of numbers (1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, etc.) contains the nth digit.
   - We can reduce the problem step by step by removing the contribution of each group of numbers until we narrow down the exact number and then the exact digit within that number.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Start with `len = 1` (for 1-digit numbers), `cnt = 9` (9 numbers), and `start = 1` (first 1-digit number).
   
2. **Determine the Range**:
   - Continuously subtract the number of digits in each range (`len * cnt`) from `n` until `n` is smaller than or equal to the current range.
   - Once the range is found, compute the exact number and the digit within that number.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After determining which number contains the nth digit, calculate its value using the formula and convert it to a string. Return the corresponding digit from this string.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
typedef long long int lli;
class Solution {
public:
    int findNthDigit(int n) {
        lli len = 1;  // Start with 1-digit numbers
        lli cnt = 9;  // 9 numbers (1 to 9)
        lli start = 1;  // Start from the number 1
        
        // Step 1: Find the range that contains the nth digit
        while (n > len * cnt) {
            n -= len * cnt;  // Reduce n by the number of digits in the current range
            len++;  // Move to the next length of numbers (2-digit, 3-digit, etc.)
            cnt *= 10;  // Increase the count of numbers in the current range (10, 100, 1000, etc.)
            start *= 10;  // Adjust the start number (10, 100, 1000, etc.)
        }
        
        // Step 2: Find the number that contains the nth digit
        start += (n - 1) / len;  // Determine the exact number by calculating the position
        string s = to_string(start);  // Convert the number to a string to access digits
        return s[(n - 1) % len] - '0';  // Return the nth digit (converted to an integer)
    }
};
```

#### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `len` represents the current length of the numbers being considered (starting from 1-digit numbers).
   - `cnt` represents how many numbers are in the current group of `len`-digit numbers (starting from 9 for 1-digit numbers).
   - `start` is the first number in the current group of `len`-digit numbers (starting from 1 for 1-digit numbers).

2. **Loop to Identify the Range**:
   - The while loop reduces `n` by subtracting the number of digits in the current range (`len * cnt`) until `n` is within the current range.
   - In each iteration, `len` is incremented to move to the next group of numbers, `cnt` is updated to reflect the number of numbers in that group, and `start` is adjusted to the first number of that group.

3. **Calculate the Exact Number**:
   - After the loop, `start` holds the first number in the range containing the nth digit.
   - We adjust `start` by adding `(n - 1) / len` to find the exact number that contains the nth digit.

4. **Extract the nth Digit**:
   - Convert the number to a string and access the digit at the position `(n - 1) % len`, where `% len` gives the position of the digit within the number.

5. **Return the Digit**:
   - Finally, the digit is returned after converting it from a character to an integer.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
1. **Finding the Range**: The while loop iterates while reducing `n` by the size of each group of numbers. Each iteration involves simple arithmetic and comparisons. Since the number of digits increases exponentially (10, 100, 1000, etc.), the number of iterations is proportional to `log n` base 10. Thus, the time complexity of the while loop is `O(log n)`.
   
2. **Finding the nth Digit**: After determining the correct number and converting it to a string, we can access the digit in constant time. Thus, the time complexity for finding the digit is `O(1)`.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is **O(log n)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is primarily used to store the number in string form. In the worst case, this number can have up to `O(log n)` digits. Therefore, the space complexity is **O(log n)**.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the nth digit in the sequence of positive integers without constructing the entire sequence. By identifying the group of numbers (1-digit, 2-digit, etc.) containing the nth digit, we reduce the problem size logarithmically. The use of simple arithmetic and string manipulation allows us to determine the exact digit in an optimal manner. The time complexity of **O(log n)** and space complexity of **O(log n)** make this approach both time-efficient and space-efficient, suitable for handling large values of `n`.
