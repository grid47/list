### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, you need to find the `n`-th digit in the sequence of integers starting from `1`. For example, the sequence is `1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 10, 11, 12, ...` and so on.

### Approach
1. **Determine the Length of Digits**:
   - Start with 1-digit numbers and determine how many numbers there are in each group of digit lengths.
   - For each length:
     - The number of integers with `len` digits is `cnt` (starting from `9` for 1-digit numbers).
     - The total number of digits contributed by this group is `len * cnt`.

2. **Finding the Group**:
   - Subtract the total number of digits in each group from `n` until `n` is less than or equal to the number of digits in the current group.
   - Increase the `len` for the next group and adjust `cnt` and `start` accordingly.

3. **Identifying the Specific Digit**:
   - Once the correct group is found:
     - Calculate which specific number corresponds to the `n`-th digit.
     - Convert that number to a string to access the specific digit directly.

### Code Walk-through
- The `findNthDigit` function initializes `len`, `cnt`, and `start`.
- It uses a while loop to determine which digit group contains the `n`-th digit by continuously subtracting the total digits in each group.
- After finding the correct number, it converts it to a string to access the specific digit based on the remaining `n`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log(n)), as the number of digits increases logarithmically with respect to `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since only a few variables are used for calculations and no additional data structures are needed.
