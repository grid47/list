### Problem Statement
Implement an RLEIterator that decodes a run-length encoded sequence. The sequence is represented as a list where every two consecutive elements denote the count and the value respectively.

### Class Definition
- **Class**: `RLEIterator`
  - **Constructor**: `RLEIterator(vector<int>& encoding)`
    - Initializes the iterator with the given encoding.
  - **Method**: `int next(int n)`
    - Returns the value of the next element in the sequence after consuming `n` elements.
    - If there are not enough elements left to fulfill the request, return `-1`.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Store the run-length encoded values in the `arr` vector.
   - Use `idx` to keep track of the current position in `arr`.

2. **Next Value Retrieval**:
   - While there are still elements left in the encoding:
     - If `n` exceeds the current count (`arr[idx]`), reduce `n` by that count and move to the next run by incrementing `idx` by 2.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to the current count:
       - Decrease the count at `arr[idx]` by `n`.
       - Return the corresponding value at `arr[idx + 1]`.
   - If the loop exits without returning a value, it means there are not enough elements left to satisfy the request, hence return `-1`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for each `next` call on average, since we can skip counts efficiently.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m) where m is the size of the input `encoding` array.
