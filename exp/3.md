### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Approach
Use a sliding window technique combined with a hash map to track the last seen index of each character. Adjust the starting point of the substring when a repeating character is encountered to ensure only unique characters are considered.

### Code Walk-through
1. Initialize `prv` to -1 (representing the last index before the start of the substring) and `len` to store the maximum length found.
2. Create a map `mp` to keep track of the most recent index of each character.
3. Loop through each character in the string `s`:
   - If the character has been seen before (exists in `mp`), update `prv` to be the maximum of its current value and the last seen index of that character.
   - Update the last seen index of the character in the map to the current index.
   - Calculate the length of the current substring as `i - prv` and update `len` if this length is greater.
4. Return the maximum length found.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) - where \(n\) is the length of the string, as we make a single pass through the string.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(min(n, m))\) - where \(m\) is the size of the character set (limited to the number of unique characters in the string).
