### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, representing the length of a 2xN board, determine the number of ways to completely tile the board using 1x2 dominoes and 2x1 trominoes. The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a dynamic programming array `v` where `v[i]` represents the number of ways to tile a 2x\(i\) board.
   - The base cases are:
     - `v[1] = 1`: One way to tile a 2x1 board (one domino).
     - `v[2] = 2`: Two ways to tile a 2x2 board (two vertical dominoes or two horizontal dominoes).
     - `v[3] = 5`: Five ways to tile a 2x3 board.
   
2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For \(i \geq 4\), the number of ways to tile a 2x\(i\) board can be expressed as:
     \[
     v[i] = 2 \cdot v[i - 1] + v[i - 3]
     \]
   - This relation accounts for the different placements of the last tiles.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be large, use modulo \(10^9 + 7\) during calculations to prevent overflow.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to compute the number of tilings.
    - `int numTilings(int n)`: Main function that calculates the number of ways to tile a 2xN board.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `n`: Length of the board.
      - **Returns**: The number of ways to tile the board modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where \(n\) is the length of the board, as we iterate from 4 to \(n\) to fill the dynamic programming array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the storage of the dynamic programming array.
