### Problem Statement
Given a 32-bit unsigned integer `n`, return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

### Approach
1. **Bit Manipulation**:
   - The approach utilizes a property of binary numbers where subtracting 1 from a number flips all the bits after the rightmost '1' bit, including that '1' bit itself. This allows for counting '1' bits efficiently.

2. **Loop until n is zero**:
   - Use a loop to continuously apply the bitwise AND operation between `n` and `n - 1` until `n` becomes zero. Each iteration effectively removes the rightmost '1' bit from `n`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the class `Solution`.
- **Line 2**: Define the `hammingWeight` function, which takes an unsigned 32-bit integer `n`.
- **Line 3**: Initialize a counter `key` to track the number of '1' bits.
- **Lines 4-6**: Use a while loop to count the '1' bits:
  - `n = n & (n - 1);` — This operation clears the least significant '1' bit in `n`.
  - `key++;` — Increment the counter for each '1' bit found.
- **Line 7**: Return the count of '1' bits (`key`).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of '1' bits in `n`. In the worst case, this can be \(O(1)\) for a 32-bit integer (up to 32 iterations).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as the operations are performed in-place without requiring additional space.
