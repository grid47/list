### Problem Statement
You are given a list of courses where each course has a duration and a deadline. Your goal is to determine the maximum number of courses you can take such that the sum of the durations of the courses you choose does not exceed the respective deadlines. You need to select the courses in such a way that you can complete as many as possible within their deadlines.

### Approach
1. **Sorting Courses**:
   - First, sort the courses by their deadlines. This allows us to consider courses in the order of their deadlines, ensuring we can optimize our selection.

2. **Using a Priority Queue**:
   - Utilize a max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the durations of the selected courses. This will allow us to efficiently manage the total duration of courses taken.
   - Maintain a running total of the sum of the durations of the selected courses.

3. **Iterate Through Courses**:
   - For each course, add its duration to the total sum and push it onto the priority queue.
   - If the total duration exceeds the current course's deadline, remove the longest duration from the total (i.e., pop the top element of the priority queue). This ensures that we are always considering the smallest total duration possible within the deadline constraints.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The size of the priority queue at the end will represent the maximum number of courses that can be taken without exceeding the deadlines.

### Code Walk-through
1. Sort the courses based on their deadlines.
2. Iterate through the sorted list and keep adding the durations to a running total and a max-heap.
3. If the total exceeds a course's deadline, adjust by removing the longest duration from the heap.
4. Finally, return the size of the heap, which corresponds to the number of courses that can be taken.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of courses. The sorting step takes O(n log n), and each insertion/removal operation on the priority queue takes O(log n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the priority queue which in the worst case can hold all the course durations.
