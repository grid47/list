### Problem Statement
Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `goal`, the task is to count the number of subarrays that sum up to `goal`.

### Approach
1. **Use of Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - The problem is solved by counting subarrays with sums at most `goal` and at most `goal - 1`.
   - The difference between these two counts gives the number of subarrays with an exact sum of `goal`.

2. **Count Subarrays with Sum At Most**:
   - Define a helper function `atmost` that counts the number of subarrays whose sum is at most `s`.
   - Initialize pointers `j` (start of the window) and `i` (end of the window) and a variable `res` to store the count of valid subarrays.

3. **Sliding Window Logic**:
   - Iterate through the array using the `i` pointer.
   - Decrease `s` by `nums[i]` for the current element.
   - If `s` becomes negative, increment the `j` pointer to shrink the window until `s` is non-negative.
   - The count of valid subarrays ending at `i` is `(i - j + 1)`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The main function calls `atmost(nums, goal)` and `atmost(nums, goal - 1)` and returns their difference.

### Code Walk-through
- The main function `numSubarraysWithSum` calculates the result using the `atmost` helper function.
- The `atmost` function maintains a sliding window to efficiently count valid subarrays.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the `nums` array, since both pointers traverse the array linearly.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional data structures are used beyond a few variables.
