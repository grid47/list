### Problem Statement
You are tasked with implementing a cashier system where customers can pay using bills of $5, $10, and $20. You start with no cash in the register, and your goal is to determine if you can provide the correct change for each transaction. If you cannot provide change for a bill, return `false`; otherwise, return `true` after processing all transactions.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: Keep track of the number of $5 and $10 bills in the register.

2. **Processing Each Bill**:
   - If the bill is $5, increment the count of $5 bills.
   - If the bill is $10, check if you have a $5 bill to give as change:
     - If you have one, decrement the count of $5 bills and increment the count of $10 bills.
     - If not, return `false` since you cannot provide change.
   - If the bill is $20, you have two options for change:
     - Preferably, give one $10 bill and one $5 bill if you have them.
     - If that is not possible, check if you have at least three $5 bills to give as change.
     - If neither option is available, return `false`.

3. **Final Return**: If you can provide change for all transactions, return `true`.

### Code Walk-through
- Iterate through each bill in the `bills` array, updating counts of $5 and $10 as necessary based on the rules defined above.
- Utilize simple conditional checks to manage the flow of money in the register.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of bills, since each bill is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only a fixed number of variables are used to keep track of the counts.
