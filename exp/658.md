### Problem Statement
Given a sorted array `arr`, an integer `k`, and an integer `x`, find the `k` closest elements to `x` in `arr`. The result should be returned in sorted order.

### Approach
1. **Binary Search**:
   - Use binary search to efficiently find the starting point of the closest elements.
   - Set the left pointer `l` to `0` and the right pointer `r` to `arr.size() - k`, which allows enough room for `k` elements to the right.

2. **Adjusting Pointers**:
   - In each iteration of the binary search:
     - Calculate the middle index `m`.
     - Compare the distance of `x` from `arr[m]` and `arr[m + k]`.
     - If `x` is closer to `arr[m + k]`, move the left pointer `l` to `m + 1`, otherwise adjust the right pointer `r` to `m`.

3. **Extracting Results**:
   - Once the binary search is complete, the left pointer `l` will point to the beginning of the `k` closest elements.
   - Return a vector containing the elements from `arr[l]` to `arr[l + k]`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: The function `findClosestElements` initializes the left and right pointers for the binary search.
2. **Binary Search Execution**: The while loop performs the binary search by adjusting the pointers based on the distance comparisons.
3. **Result Construction**: The result vector is constructed using the range defined by the left pointer.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log(N) + k), where N is the number of elements in the array. The binary search takes O(log(N)) time, and the construction of the result vector takes O(k) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k) for the result vector returned.
