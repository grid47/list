### Problem Statement
You are given the root of a binary tree. Your task is to find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.

### Approach
The solution utilizes a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the binary tree to compute the longest univalue path. The main steps are:

1. **DFS Traversal**: Perform a post-order DFS traversal of the tree, processing the left and right children before the parent node.

2. **Path Length Calculation**:
   - For each node, determine the longest path on its left and right that has the same value as the node itself.
   - If the left child has the same value, add its path length to `l` (left length); similarly, for the right child.

3. **Update Maximum Length**: Compare and store the maximum univalue path length found during the traversal.

4. **Return Result**: After traversing all nodes, return the maximum path length found.

### Code Walk-through
- The `longestUnivaluePath` function initializes the maximum length and checks for edge cases (e.g., if the tree is empty or a single node).
- The `dfs` function calculates the lengths of the left and right univalue paths for each node, updating the maximum length found so far.
- The function returns the longer of the left or right univalue path lengths plus one (to account for the current node).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), this could be O(N).

This efficient approach allows for calculating the longest univalue path in a binary tree with minimal overhead and clear logic.
