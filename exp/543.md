### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, find the diameter of the tree. The diameter is defined as the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root. The length of a path is the number of edges between the nodes.

### Approach
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Perform a DFS traversal of the binary tree to compute the depth of each node while simultaneously updating the diameter.

2. **Depth Calculation**:
   - For each node, calculate the depth of its left and right subtrees.
   - The diameter at that node is the sum of the depths of the left and right subtrees.

3. **Update Diameter**:
   - Maintain a variable to keep track of the maximum diameter found during the traversal.

### Code Walk-through
- The function `diameterOfBinaryTree` initializes the diameter (`d`) to zero and calls the helper function `dep` to compute the depths of the nodes.
- The `dep` function recursively calculates the depth of the left and right subtrees for a given node, updating the diameter (`d`) whenever a larger value is found.
- The function returns the depth of the current node, which is `1 + max(depth of left subtree, depth of right subtree)`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where `h` is the height of the tree, due to the recursive stack space used by the DFS. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), this can be O(n).
