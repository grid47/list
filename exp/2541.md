### Problem Statement

The problem involves determining the minimum number of operations needed to convert two arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, into identical arrays by applying a specific transformation. The transformation allows adding a fixed integer `k` to one element in `nums1` and subtracting `k` from the corresponding element in `nums2`. The goal is to find the minimum number of such operations or return `-1` if it's impossible.

### Approach

To solve this problem, the key is to analyze the difference between corresponding elements in `nums1` and `nums2`. By performing the allowed operation (adding or subtracting `k`), we can adjust these differences. The solution needs to track how many operations are required to make the elements of `nums1` match those in `nums2`. Hereâ€™s the detailed breakdown of the solution approach:

1. **Handle the Edge Case Where `k == 0`**: If `k` is `0`, no operation is possible. The arrays should already be identical for a solution to exist. If any element in `nums1` doesn't match the corresponding element in `nums2`, return `-1`. Otherwise, return `0` since no operations are required.

2. **Adjust Elements by Calculating Differences**: For each pair of elements from `nums1` and `nums2`, compute the difference. If the difference is not divisible by `k`, it is impossible to match the arrays, and we should return `-1`. If the difference is divisible by `k`, the number of operations required for that element can be determined by dividing the difference by `k`.

3. **Track Operations**: We maintain a running total of positive and negative differences. To balance the differences and make the arrays identical, the total positive difference must equal the total negative difference. If they do not balance out, return `-1` because it's impossible to equalize the arrays. Otherwise, calculate the total number of operations based on the positive differences and return the result.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Handle Special Case When `k == 0`
```cpp
if(k == 0) {
    for(int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); i++) {
        if(nums1[i] != nums2[i]) return -1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In this block of code, we check if `k` is `0`. If `k` is `0`, the operation of adding or subtracting `k` cannot be performed, so the arrays should already be identical. We loop through the arrays and check if any element in `nums1` does not match the corresponding element in `nums2`. If any mismatch is found, we return `-1`. If the arrays are already equal, we return `0`, as no operations are required.

#### Step 2: Compute the Difference and Check Divisibility
```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); i++) {
    nums1[i] -= nums2[i];
    if(nums1[i] % k != 0) return -1;
}
```
In this part of the code, we calculate the difference between the corresponding elements of `nums1` and `nums2` and update `nums1` to store these differences. Then, we check if each difference is divisible by `k`. If any difference is not divisible by `k`, it is impossible to make the arrays equal using the allowed operation, so we return `-1`.

#### Step 3: Track Positive and Negative Differences
```cpp
long long res = 0, sum = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); i++) {
    if(nums1[i] > 0) res += nums1[i] / k;
    sum += nums1[i];
}
```
Here, we iterate through the updated `nums1`, which now contains the differences between corresponding elements of `nums1` and `nums2`. If the difference is positive, it means we need to add `k` multiple times to equalize the two arrays. We track how many operations are needed by dividing the positive difference by `k` and accumulating this in `res`. We also calculate the total sum of the differences in `sum`.

#### Step 4: Ensure Balancing of Positive and Negative Differences
```cpp
if(sum != 0) return -1;
```
After calculating the total sum of the differences, we check if it is zero. This check ensures that the total positive and negative differences balance out. If the sum is not zero, it is impossible to equalize the arrays using the allowed operation, so we return `-1`.

#### Step 5: Return the Result
```cpp
return res;
```
Finally, if the sum is zero, we return `res`, which contains the total number of operations required to make the arrays equal.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **Step 1**: Checking if `k == 0` takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the size of the arrays. This is because we iterate through the arrays once to check for equality.
- **Step 2**: Calculating the differences between corresponding elements in `nums1` and `nums2` also takes `O(n)` time. This is a single iteration over the arrays.
- **Step 3**: Iterating through the updated `nums1` and calculating the total operations also takes `O(n)` time.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity of the algorithm is `O(n)` because we iterate through the arrays at most three times.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space for Arrays**: We store the difference of elements in `nums1`, which requires `O(n)` space.
- **Auxiliary Space**: We only use a few extra variables (`res`, `sum`), so the auxiliary space complexity is `O(1)`.
- **Overall Space Complexity**: The overall space complexity is `O(n)` because we modify `nums1` in place to store the differences.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the problem by calculating the differences between corresponding elements in `nums1` and `nums2`, and then checking if these differences are divisible by `k`. The key idea is to balance the positive and negative differences, ensuring that we can perform the necessary operations to make the arrays equal.

The time complexity of the solution is linear, `O(n)`, which is optimal for this problem. The space complexity is also linear, `O(n)`, due to the storage of the differences in `nums1`. This approach efficiently handles the problem even for larger input sizes.
