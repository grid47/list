### Problem Statement

The problem is to select a maximum number of non-adjacent slices from a circular array of pizza slices represented by an array `nums`, such that we can only take a maximum of \( n/3 \) slices, where \( n \) is the total number of slices in the array. The challenge lies in ensuring that no two adjacent slices are selected and that we can choose slices from a circular arrangement.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach, which allows us to efficiently explore possible selections of pizza slices while adhering to the constraints of adjacency and the limit on the number of slices taken. The key steps of the approach are as follows:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: We will use a 3D memoization table to store intermediate results, which helps in avoiding redundant calculations.

2. **Recursive State Definition**: Define a recursive function that takes the current index in the array, the first slice selected, and the count of slices remaining to select.

3. **Base Cases**: Establish base cases for recursion:
   - If no slices are left to choose, return 0.
   - If we have considered all slices, return a minimum value indicating that this path is not valid.

4. **Recursive Case**: For each slice, decide whether to include it or skip it, and update the result accordingly.

5. **Iterate Over All Slices**: Since the arrangement is circular, initiate the recursion from each possible starting point to ensure all configurations are considered.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

The provided C++ code implements the above approach as follows:

1. **Class and Member Variables**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
       int n;
       vector<vector<vector<int>>> mem;
       vector<int> nums;
   ```
   - The `Solution` class contains member variables: `n` for the number of slices, `mem` for memoization, and `nums` for the array of pizza slices.

2. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   ```cpp
       int dp(int idx, int fst, int cnt) {
           if(cnt == 0) return 0;
           if(idx >= n) return INT_MIN;
           if(mem[idx][cnt][fst + 1] != -1) return mem[idx][cnt][fst + 1];
   ```
   - The `dp` function calculates the maximum slices that can be obtained starting from index `idx`, where `fst` indicates the first selected slice, and `cnt` indicates how many slices remain to be selected.
   - It checks the base cases: if no slices are left to choose, return 0; if all slices have been considered, return a minimum value; if the result is already computed, return it.

3. **Recursion Logic**:
   ```cpp
           int ans = dp(idx + 1, fst, cnt);
           if((idx + 1)% n != fst) {
               ans = max(ans, dp(idx + 2, fst, cnt - 1) + nums[idx]);
           }
   ```
   - The function first explores the option of skipping the current slice by calling `dp(idx + 1, fst, cnt)`.
   - It then considers selecting the current slice. The condition `(idx + 1) % n != fst` ensures that the slice selected does not overlap with the first slice selected, adhering to the circular constraint.

4. **Memoization Update**:
   ```cpp
           return mem[idx][cnt][fst + 1] = ans;
       }
   ```
   - The calculated answer for the current state is stored in the memoization table before returning.

5. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
       int maxSizeSlices(vector<int>& nums) {
           this->n = nums.size();
           mem.resize(n, vector<vector<int>>(n/3 + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, -1)));
           this->nums = nums;
           int res = 0;
           for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++)
               res = max(res, dp(i + 2, i, n/3 - 1) + nums[i]);
           return res;
       }
   };
   ```
   - The `maxSizeSlices` function initializes the necessary variables and the memoization table.
   - It then iterates through each slice, initiating the recursive computation for maximum slices starting from that slice. It considers the first slice selected and computes the maximum possible slices based on the recursive logic.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum result obtained.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) because for each of the \(n\) starting points, we can have \(n\) recursive calls at maximum, constrained by the limits of slices that can be selected.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(n^2)\) due to the memoization table, which stores results for each combination of index and slices remaining.

### Conclusion

The provided solution effectively utilizes dynamic programming to tackle the problem of selecting the maximum number of pizza slices while adhering to constraints on adjacency and selection limits. The use of memoization enhances efficiency by avoiding redundant calculations. 

This approach not only demonstrates a robust understanding of dynamic programming principles but also provides an elegant solution to a combinatorial optimization problem. Understanding this code equips developers with the skills to handle similar problems involving constraints, recursion, and optimization, making it a valuable addition to their algorithmic toolkit.

Moreover, the solution highlights the importance of considering edge cases, such as the circular arrangement of elements, and how to navigate these complexities using strategic indexing and memoization. This kind of problem-solving approach is essential in both competitive programming and practical software development, where efficiency and correctness are paramount. Overall, the `maxSizeSlices` function is a commendable implementation that balances clarity and performance, serving as a great reference for similar algorithmic challenges.
