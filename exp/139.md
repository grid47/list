### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `dict`, determine if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

### Approach
1. **HashMap**:
   - Use a map to store the dictionary words for quick lookup.
2. **Memoization**:
   - Use a vector to memoize results of subproblems, where each index represents the start of a substring in `s`.
3. **Backtracking**:
   - Implement a backtracking function that tries to break the string at different positions and checks if the remaining substring can also be segmented.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 3**: Define the `memo` vector to store results for each starting index in `s`.
- **Line 4**: Define the `wordBreak` function:
  - **Line 5-7**: Populate the map `mp` with words from the dictionary.
  - **Line 8**: Initialize the `memo` vector with `-1` (indicating unvisited).
  - **Line 9**: Call the backtracking function starting from index `0`.
- **Line 11**: Define the `bt` function:
  - **Line 12**: If the index is equal to the length of `s`, return `true` (base case).
  - **Line 14**: If the result for the current index is already computed, return it.
  - **Line 16-19**: Iterate through possible substrings starting from `idx`. If a valid word is found in the dictionary, recursively check the next part of the string. If successful, memoize and return `true`.
- **Line 21**: If no valid segmentation is found, memoize `false` and return it.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) is the length of the string, as we check each substring.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for the memoization vector.
