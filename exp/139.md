### Problem Statement

The problem asks you to determine if a string `s` can be segmented into space-separated words from a given dictionary `dict`. The goal is to break down the string into valid substrings that are present in the dictionary.

For example:
- Input: `s = "leetcode"`, `dict = ["leet", "code"]`
- Output: `true` because `"leetcode"` can be segmented into `"leet"` and `"code"`.

### Approach

This problem can be approached using **dynamic programming (DP)** with **memoization** to avoid redundant computations, making the solution more efficient. Here's how the problem can be broken down:

1. **Memoization**: We use an array (`memo`) to store the results of subproblems. If we've already computed whether a substring can be segmented, we don't need to recompute it.
2. **Backtracking**: We iterate through the string, and for each index, try to match a substring with any word in the dictionary. If a match is found, we recursively check the remaining substring.
3. **Dictionary Lookup**: We store the dictionary words in a `map` for **constant-time lookup** while checking if a substring is present in the dictionary.

By using memoization, we avoid recalculating the results for substrings that have already been checked, improving the algorithm's efficiency.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's walk through the code step-by-step to understand how it works.

#### Step 1: Initialization of `memo` and `map`

```cpp
vector<int> memo;
bool wordBreak(string s, vector<string>& dict) {
    map<string, bool> mp;
    for(string d: dict)
        mp[d] = true;
    memo.resize(s.size(), -1);
    return bt(s, 0, mp);
}
```

1. **Memo Array**: We initialize the `memo` array to have the same size as the string `s`. Initially, all values in `memo` are set to `-1` to represent that no substring has been processed yet. Once a result is computed for a specific index, we update it with either `true` or `false`.
2. **Map for Dictionary**: We convert the `dict` (list of words) into a `map` (`mp`). The map allows for **constant-time lookups**, ensuring that we can quickly check if a substring is present in the dictionary.
3. **Calling the Backtracking Function**: We start the backtracking function `bt` from index `0` of the string `s`.

#### Step 2: Backtracking Function (`bt`)

```cpp
bool bt(string s, int idx, map<string, bool> &mp) {
    if (idx == s.size()) return true;
    if (memo[idx] != -1) return memo[idx];
    
    for (int i = idx; i < s.size(); i++) {
        if (mp.count(s.substr(idx, i - idx + 1)) && bt(s, i + 1, mp))
            return memo[idx] = true;
    }
    
    return memo[idx] = false;
}
```

1. **Base Case (End of String)**: 
   ```cpp
   if (idx == s.size()) return true;
   ```
   If the current index `idx` reaches the size of the string `s`, it means the entire string has been successfully segmented. We return `true` to indicate that it's possible to break the string up to this point.

2. **Memoization Lookup**:
   ```cpp
   if (memo[idx] != -1) return memo[idx];
   ```
   If the result for the current index has already been computed, we directly return it to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Backtracking**:
   ```cpp
   for (int i = idx; i < s.size(); i++) {
       if (mp.count(s.substr(idx, i - idx + 1)) && bt(s, i + 1, mp))
           return memo[idx] = true;
   }
   ```
   We iterate through the string starting from `idx` to `i`. For each substring from `idx` to `i`, we check if it exists in the dictionary (`mp.count(...)`). If it does, we recursively call `bt` for the next part of the string (`i + 1`). This ensures that we break the string into valid words.
   
   - If a valid substring is found and the recursive call returns `true` for the remaining part of the string, we update `memo[idx]` to `true` and return `true` for this call.

4. **Returning `false`**:
   ```cpp
   return memo[idx] = false;
   ```
   If no valid segmentations are found from index `idx`, we update `memo[idx]` to `false` and return `false`.

#### Step 3: Final Result

After the backtracking function completes, the result will be stored in `memo[0]`, indicating whether the string can be segmented starting from index `0`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^2)**: The time complexity is determined by the number of substring checks performed. For each starting index `idx`, we check all possible substrings starting from `idx` to the end of the string. Each substring check takes `O(n)` time, and since we perform this check for each index, the overall time complexity is \( O(n^2) \), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We use a `memo` array of size `n` to store the results for each index. Additionally, the `map` used for the dictionary takes space proportional to the number of words in `dict`, but it does not affect the overall complexity since the dictionary size is typically much smaller than the string length.

### Conclusion

This solution is an efficient way to determine whether a string can be segmented into valid words from a given dictionary. The key techniques used are:
- **Backtracking** to explore all possible segmentations.
- **Memoization** to store the results of previously computed subproblems, thus avoiding redundant calculations and improving efficiency.

#### Key Insights:
- **Memoization**: Helps avoid recomputing results for the same substring, thus improving the solution's time complexity.
- **Backtracking**: Enables us to explore all potential ways to segment the string while pruning redundant computations.
- **Efficient Dictionary Lookup**: The use of a `map` ensures quick lookups when checking if a substring exists in the dictionary.

This approach efficiently solves the problem with a time complexity of \( O(n^2) \), making it suitable for moderate-sized input strings.
