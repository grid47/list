### Problem Statement
You are given a target position and two arrays, `pos` (representing the initial positions of cars) and `v` (representing their respective speeds). Your task is to determine how many car fleets will arrive at the target position.

### Approach
1. **Calculate Arrival Times**:
   - Use a `map` to store the negative positions as keys and their respective arrival times at the target as values. This is done to sort the positions in descending order.
   - The arrival time for each car can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{time} = \frac{\text{target} - \text{position}}{\text{speed}}
     \]
   - Store the computed time in the map.

2. **Count Fleets**:
   - Initialize a variable `fleet` to count the number of fleets and `cur` to track the current maximum time of the fleet.
   - Iterate through the map of times. For each time:
     - If the current car's time is greater than `cur`, it indicates a new fleet, so increment `fleet` and update `cur` to the current time.

3. **Return Result**:
   - After iterating through all the cars, return the total count of fleets.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N), where N is the number of cars. This is due to the sorting of positions and calculating arrival times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for storing the arrival times in the map.
