### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, return the level-order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

### Approach
1. Use a queue to traverse each level of the binary tree.
2. Add the root node to the queue initially.
3. For each level, iterate through all nodes currently in the queue, collect their values, and enqueue their child nodes (left and right).
4. Append the collected values for each level to the result list.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 3**: Define a 2D vector `ans` to store the result and return an empty result if the root is `NULL`.
- **Line 5**: Initialize a queue `q` and enqueue the `root` node.
- **Line 7**: Enter the main loop which processes nodes level by level.
- **Line 8**: Store the size of the current level in `sz`.
- **Line 9**: Initialize a `res` vector to store values of the current level.
- **Line 10-16**: For each node in the current level, add its value to `res`, enqueue its left and right children if they exist.
- **Line 17**: After processing all nodes at this level, add `res` to `ans`.
- **Line 19**: Return `ans`, which contains the level-order traversal.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes, as each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\), due to the storage required for the queue and the result list.
