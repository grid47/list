### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

### Approach
1. **Backtracking**:
   - Use a recursive backtracking method to explore all possible subsets.
   - Maintain a temporary vector to store the current subset being constructed.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the current index (`idx`) reaches the size of the input array, add the temporary subset to the results.

3. **Recursive Exploration**:
   - At each index, there are two choices:
     - Exclude the current number and move to the next index.
     - Include the current number in the subset, add it to the temporary vector, and then move to the next index.
   - After exploring with the current number included, remove it from the temporary vector (backtrack) for further exploration.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Store the input array in a class member variable and initialize the results vector.
   - Call the backtracking function starting from index `0`.

2. **Backtracking Function**:
   - Check if the current index is equal to the size of the input array.
   - If true, add the current subset to the results.
   - Recursively call the backtracking function, first excluding the current number, then including it, and finally backtracking by popping the last added number.

3. **Return the Result**: 
   - After all recursive calls, return the list of subsets.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(2^n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in `nums`. Each element can either be included or excluded from the subset, leading to \( 2^n \) possible subsets.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \) for the temporary vector used to store the current subset during recursion.
