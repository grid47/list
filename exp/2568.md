### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of integers, the task is to find the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented as the bitwise OR of any subset of the elements in `nums`. In other words, we need to determine the minimum integer that cannot be obtained by any combination of bitwise OR operations on elements of `nums`.

### Approach

1. **Using a Set to Track Numbers in `nums`**:
   - First, we use a set called `cnt` to store all unique elements in `nums`. Sets allow for efficient lookup operations, enabling us to quickly check if specific integers are present in the array.
   
2. **Starting with the Smallest Positive Integer**:
   - We initialize a variable `ret` to `1`, which represents the smallest positive integer. This variable will help us find the minimum integer that cannot be formed as a bitwise OR of elements in `nums`.
   
3. **Checking for Powers of 2**:
   - The bitwise OR operation combines bits from multiple numbers to form new values. To create all integers up to a specific positive integer, the presence of all lower powers of `2` (such as `1, 2, 4, 8, ...`) is essential.
   - Starting with `ret = 1`, we check if `1` exists in `cnt`. If `1` is present, then we move to `2` (which is the next power of 2, or `1 * 2`). If `2` is also in `cnt`, we check for `4` (i.e., `2 * 2`), and so on.
   - This process continues until we find a power of `2` that is not in `cnt`. This missing power of `2` is the smallest integer that cannot be formed by OR combinations of numbers in `nums`.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - The first missing power of `2` represents the minimum integer that cannot be represented as a bitwise OR of any subset of `nums`. This is the value of `ret` when we exit the loop.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Initialize and Populate the Set**:
   ```cpp
   set<int> cnt;
   int n = nums.size();
   for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       cnt.insert(nums[i]);
   }
   ```
   - We create a set called `cnt` to hold all unique elements in `nums`.
   - By looping through `nums`, we add each element to `cnt`. This allows for constant-time lookup for checking the presence of integers in `nums`.

2. **Finding the Minimum Missing Integer**:
   ```cpp
   int ret = 1;
   while(cnt.count(ret)) {
       ret *= 2;
   }
   ```
   - Initialize `ret` to `1`, which represents the smallest power of `2`.
   - Using a `while` loop, we check if `ret` exists in `cnt`. If it does, we multiply `ret` by `2` to move to the next power of `2`.
   - The loop continues until we reach a value of `ret` that does not exist in `cnt`. This missing power of `2` is the smallest integer that cannot be represented as the OR of any subset of elements in `nums`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return ret;
   ```
   - The final value of `ret` is returned, representing the smallest positive integer that cannot be formed by OR combinations of elements in `nums`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), mainly due to the use of a set and the process of iterating through the powers of `2`.
  - Inserting all elements into a set requires \(O(n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`.
  - The loop that checks for missing powers of `2` generally runs for \(O(\log M)\) iterations, where \(M\) is the largest power of `2` required to exceed the maximum number in `nums`.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(n)\), as we store all elements in a set.

### Conclusion

This approach efficiently finds the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented as a bitwise OR of any subset of elements in `nums` by leveraging powers of `2` and set operations for fast lookup. This solution is optimal for checking possible missing integers with minimal computations, making it both time-efficient and straightforward.
