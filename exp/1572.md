### Problem Statement

The problem involves calculating the sum of the diagonal elements in a square matrix. A square matrix is defined as a matrix with an equal number of rows and columns. In this context, we are specifically interested in two diagonals:
1. **Primary Diagonal**: The diagonal that runs from the top left to the bottom right of the matrix.
2. **Secondary Diagonal**: The diagonal that runs from the top right to the bottom left.

Given an `n x n` matrix, the objective is to compute the total sum of the elements located on both diagonals. However, when the matrix size is odd, the center element (which lies on both diagonals) should only be counted once. 

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can take the following steps:

1. **Iterate through the matrix**: Loop through each row of the matrix. For each row `i`, we can identify the following elements:
   - The element at the primary diagonal, which is located at the coordinates `(i, i)`.
   - The element at the secondary diagonal, which is located at the coordinates `(i, n - 1 - i)`.

2. **Sum the diagonal elements**: As we iterate through the rows, we add the values of both diagonal elements to a cumulative sum. 

3. **Handle the center element**: If the size of the matrix `n` is odd, we need to subtract the center element from the sum to avoid double-counting. The center element is located at `(n/2, n/2)`.

4. **Return the final sum**: Finally, we return the calculated sum.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Now, let’s break down the provided code to see how it implements the above approach.

- **Class Declaration**: The solution is encapsulated within a class named `Solution`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
```

- **Function Definition**: The `diagonalSum` function is defined to take a 2D vector (matrix) as input and returns an integer representing the sum of the diagonal elements.

```cpp
int diagonalSum(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
```

- **Matrix Size Calculation**: We determine the size of the matrix `n` by using `mat.size()`, which gives the number of rows (and columns, since it’s square).

```cpp
int n = mat.size(), sum = 0;
```

- **Iterate Through Each Row**: A for loop is initiated to iterate through the range of `n`. For each iteration, the current index `i` corresponds to the current row being processed.

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
```

- **Sum the Diagonal Elements**:
   - The element at the primary diagonal is accessed with `mat[i][i]`.
   - The element at the secondary diagonal is accessed with `mat[n - 1 - i][i]`.
   - Both elements are added to the cumulative sum.

```cpp
sum += mat[i][i] + mat[n - 1 - i][i];
```

- **Adjust for Odd Matrix Size**: After summing the diagonal elements, we check if `n` is odd. If it is, we subtract the value of the center element from the sum. The center element can be accessed using the expression `mat[n/2][n/2]`.

```cpp
if(n % 2) sum -= mat[n/2][n/2];
```

- **Return the Final Sum**: Finally, the computed sum is returned as the result of the function.

```cpp
return sum;
}
```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of rows (or columns) in the square matrix. This is because we perform a single loop that iterates through each row exactly once.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are only using a fixed number of variables (for the sum and indices) regardless of the size of the input matrix. We do not use any additional data structures that grow with input size.

### Conclusion

The `diagonalSum` function effectively calculates the sum of the diagonal elements in a square matrix by utilizing a straightforward iterative approach. By leveraging the properties of matrix indices, the function efficiently accesses the necessary elements and handles the case of odd-sized matrices by adjusting the sum accordingly.

This implementation highlights the utility of direct access in 2D arrays, showcasing how mathematical properties can simplify programming tasks. Additionally, the solution is both efficient and elegant, adhering to best practices for algorithm design by minimizing complexity while maximizing clarity.

Understanding this solution equips developers with the necessary tools to tackle similar problems involving matrices and array manipulations. The simplicity of the approach makes it a valuable reference for educational purposes, competitive programming, or technical interviews where such problems are commonly presented.

In summary, this algorithm serves as an excellent example of how to approach problems involving matrix diagonal sums, emphasizing clarity, efficiency, and correctness. The `diagonalSum` function stands as a practical solution for real-world applications and serves as a reminder of the beauty of mathematical problem-solving through programming.
