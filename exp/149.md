### Problem Statement
Given an array of points where each point is represented by its coordinates \((x, y)\), determine the maximum number of points that can lie on the same straight line.

### Approach
1. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the number of points is less than or equal to 2, return the number of points since any two points can form a line.

2. **Using Slope Calculation**:
   - For each point, calculate the slope of the line formed with every other point.
   - Use a map to keep track of the frequency of each slope.

3. **Slope Calculation**:
   - If the x-coordinates of two points are the same, the slope is considered vertical (set as `DBL_MAX`).
   - Otherwise, calculate the slope using the formula:
     \[
     \text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
     \]
   - Count how many times each slope appears for the current point.

4. **Finding Maximum Points**:
   - Update the maximum count of points on a line whenever a slope's frequency exceeds the current maximum.

5. **Return Result**:
   - The result is the maximum count of points on a line plus one (to include the starting point).

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1-3**: Define the `maxPoints` function and check for edge cases.
- **Line 5**: Initialize a variable `mx` to keep track of the maximum points on the same line.
- **Line 7-8**: Iterate through each point \(p1\) as the reference point.
- **Line 9**: Create a map `ma` to count occurrences of slopes for the current point.
- **Line 10-16**: Nested loop to calculate the slope between \(p1\) and every other point \(p2\):
  - Skip if \(p1\) and \(p2\) are the same.
  - Calculate the slope and update its count in the map.
  - Update `mx` if the current slope count exceeds the previous maximum.
- **Line 17**: Return `mx + 1` to include the reference point.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) is the number of points, due to the nested iteration to calculate slopes.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for the map storing slopes for each reference point.
