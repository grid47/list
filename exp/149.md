### Problem Statement

The problem is to find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line in a 2D plane. Given a list of points, where each point is represented by a pair of integers `[x, y]`, we need to determine the maximum number of points that lie on the same line. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the line passing through any two points and count how many points lie on that line.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Line Equation:**
   The general form of the equation of a line passing through two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` can be expressed in terms of its slope `m`, where:
   \[
   m = \frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}
   \]
   If the slope is the same for multiple pairs of points, these points lie on the same straight line. In this case, our task is to calculate the slope between every pair of points and count how many times each slope occurs.

2. **Handling Special Cases:**
   - Vertical lines: For vertical lines where `x1 == x2`, the slope is undefined or infinite. This can be handled using a special constant like `DBL_MAX` (a predefined constant representing the largest possible double).
   - Duplicate points: If there are duplicate points, they should be considered as part of the same line, so we need to handle them separately by counting them explicitly.

3. **Using a Map for Counting Slopes:**
   - We use a map to store how many points have the same slope relative to a fixed point `p1`. This map is keyed by the slope, and the value is the count of points with that slope.
   - For each point `p1`, we compute the slope for every other point `p2` and update the map. After calculating the slopes for all other points with respect to `p1`, we determine the maximum number of points that share the same slope with `p1`.

4. **Optimizing the Search:**
   - The solution involves iterating over each point and computing the slopes with every other point, ensuring that we consider every possible line. The maximum number of points on the same line is then determined by finding the maximum count of slopes for each point `p1`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Handle Edge Cases for Small Input
```cpp
if(pts.size() <= 2) return pts.size();
```
In this step, we immediately handle the edge case where there are fewer than or exactly two points. If there are two or fewer points, they always lie on a single line, so we can return the number of points directly.

#### Step 2: Initialize Maximum Count
```cpp
int mx = 0;
```
We initialize a variable `mx` to track the maximum number of points on the same line as we iterate through the points.

#### Step 3: Iterate Over Each Point
```cpp
for(auto p1: pts) {
    map<double, int> ma;
    for(auto p2: pts) {
        if(p1 == p2) continue;
```
We loop through each point `p1` in the list. For each point `p1`, we initialize an empty map `ma` which will be used to count the occurrences of different slopes. We then iterate over each point `p2` and compute the slope between `p1` and `p2`.

We skip comparing a point to itself (`if(p1 == p2) continue;`) because the slope of a point with itself is undefined.

#### Step 4: Calculate the Slope
```cpp
double slope = 0;
if(p1[0] == p2[0]) slope = DBL_MAX;
else {
    slope = (double) (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0]);
}
```
To calculate the slope between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`:
- If `p1[0] == p2[0]`, the points are vertically aligned, so we assign the slope to `DBL_MAX` to represent an infinite slope.
- Otherwise, we calculate the slope using the formula:  
  \[
  \text{slope} = \frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}
  \]
This ensures we handle both vertical and non-vertical lines correctly.

#### Step 5: Update the Map with the Slope Count
```cpp
ma[slope]++;
if(ma[slope] > mx)
    mx = ma[slope];
```
We increment the count of the slope in the map `ma`. If the count of the current slope exceeds the current `mx`, we update `mx` with the new maximum count.

#### Step 6: Return the Final Result
```cpp
return mx + 1;
```
Since the map counts how many points have the same slope with respect to `p1`, `mx` represents the maximum number of points that share the same slope with `p1`. However, we need to add 1 to `mx` because `p1` itself is part of the line, and we need to include it in the count. Therefore, the final result is `mx + 1`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The algorithm involves iterating over each point `p1` and, for each point `p1`, iterating over every other point `p2` to compute the slope. This results in a time complexity of `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the number of points.
- For each pair of points `(p1, p2)`, calculating the slope takes constant time, so the total time complexity is `O(n^2)`.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is `O(n)` because we use a map to store the slope counts for each point `p1`. The map has at most `n` entries (in the worst case, if all slopes are unique), and the space required for storing the map is proportional to `n`.
- Additionally, we use some constant space for tracking variables such as `mx` and `slope`.

Thus, the overall space complexity is `O(n)`.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the problem of finding the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line in a 2D plane. By calculating the slope between every pair of points and using a map to track the occurrences of each slope, the algorithm ensures that we find the maximum number of points on the same line. The time complexity of `O(n^2)` makes this solution feasible for inputs of moderate size, and the space complexity of `O(n)` ensures that the solution is space-efficient. The approach is robust enough to handle vertical lines and duplicate points, making it a comprehensive solution to the problem.
