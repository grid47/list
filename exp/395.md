### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, find the length of the longest substring in `s` where each character appears at least `k` times.

### Approach
1. **Base Cases**:
   - If the string is empty or `k` is greater than the length of the string, return `0`.
   - If `k` is `0`, return the length of the string since all characters will satisfy the condition.

2. **Character Frequency Count**:
   - Use a hash map to count the frequency of each character in the string.

3. **Finding Invalid Characters**:
   - Traverse the string to find the first character that appears fewer than `k` times. This character will be used as a delimiter to split the string into substrings.

4. **Recursive Substring Calculation**:
   - If all characters meet the frequency requirement (i.e., the entire string is valid), return the length of the string.
   - Otherwise, recursively compute the longest valid substring in the two parts of the string:
     - From the start of the string to just before the invalid character.
     - From just after the invalid character to the end of the string.

5. **Return the Maximum Length**: 
   - The result is the maximum of the two recursive calls.

### Code Walk-through
- The `longestSubstring` function uses recursion to break down the problem:
   - First, it counts character occurrences.
   - It identifies the first character that does not satisfy the condition and uses it to divide the string.
   - Recursive calls are made for the two resulting substrings, and the maximum length is computed and returned.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the length of the string. In the worst case, the function may be called recursively for each character, and string substrings are created in each call.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the frequency map, as it contains a limited number of characters (constant space).
