### Problem Statement
Given a sorted array of integers where every element appears twice except for one element that appears exactly once, find that single element.

### Approach
1. **Using XOR Operation**:
   - Leverage the property of the XOR operation where `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`. This means that if you XOR all the numbers together, the pairs will cancel each other out, leaving only the unique number.

2. **Iterating Through the Array**:
   - Initialize a result variable (`res`) to 0. Iterate through each number in the array and apply the XOR operation.

### Code Walk-through
- The `for` loop iterates through each element in the `nums` vector, applying the XOR operation to accumulate the result in `res`. Since all duplicate elements will cancel each other out, `res` will ultimately hold the value of the single non-duplicate element.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, since we are traversing the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space for the result variable.
