### Problem Statement

The problem asks to validate whether a given string is a valid IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or neither. The input string will be in the form of a query, and the solution needs to determine if it is a valid representation of an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or neither. The goal is to return one of three possible results:
- "IPv4" if the address is a valid IPv4 address.
- "IPv6" if the address is a valid IPv6 address.
- "Neither" if it is neither.

### Approach

The solution involves parsing the string and checking its structure based on the rules for valid IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. 

1. **IPv4 Address**:
   - An IPv4 address consists of four decimal numbers, each between 0 and 255, separated by periods (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
   - Each number must not have leading zeros unless the number is exactly `0`.
   - The address should contain exactly four segments, and each segment should be a valid integer between 0 and 255.

2. **IPv6 Address**:
   - An IPv6 address consists of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).
   - Each group must contain 1 to 4 hexadecimal characters (digits 0-9 and letters a-f or A-F).
   - The address should contain exactly eight groups.

3. **General Approach**:
   - The solution first checks the character that separates the segments of the address (either a period for IPv4 or a colon for IPv6).
   - Based on the separator, it calls specific functions to validate the format of the address:
     - `checkIPv4` to validate an IPv4 address.
     - `checkIPv6` to validate an IPv6 address.
   - If neither of these conditions are met, the answer is "Neither".

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: `validIPAddress` Function
The `validIPAddress` function processes the input string and decides whether it’s an IPv4, IPv6, or neither.

```cpp
for(char ch: queryIP) {
    if (ch == '.') {
        if(checkIPv4(queryIP))
            return "IPv4";
        return "Neither";
    } else if (ch == ':') {
        if(checkIPv6(queryIP))                
            return "IPv6";
        return "Neither";
    }
}
return "Neither";
```

- The function iterates through each character of the string `queryIP`.
- If the character is a period (`.`), it checks whether the address is a valid IPv4 address by calling `checkIPv4()`. If valid, it returns "IPv4", otherwise it returns "Neither".
- Similarly, if the character is a colon (`:`), it checks for a valid IPv6 address using `checkIPv6()`. If valid, it returns "IPv6", otherwise it returns "Neither".
- If the string doesn’t match the format for either IPv4 or IPv6, the function returns "Neither".

#### Step 2: `checkIPv4` Function
The `checkIPv4` function validates an IPv4 address.

```cpp
s += '.';
stringstream ss(s);
string str;
int n_mark = 0;
while(getline(ss, str, '.')) {
    if(str.size() < 1 || str.size() > 3) return false;
    for(char ip: str) {
        if(ip<='9' && ip >= '0') continue;
        else return false;
    }
    if((str[0] == '0' && str[1] == '0') || (str[0] == '0' && str[1] >= '0' && str[1] <= '9'))
        return false;
    if(stoi(str) > 255) return false;
    n_mark++;
}
if(n_mark != 4) return false;
return true;
```

- The function first appends a period (`.`) to the end of the string `s` to simplify processing.
- A `stringstream` object `ss` is created to split the string by the period (`.`).
- Each part of the split string is checked:
  - The part must have a length between 1 and 3 characters.
  - The part must consist only of digits (0-9).
  - If the part starts with a `0` and has more than one digit, it’s invalid (e.g., `01` is not valid).
  - The number formed by the part must be less than or equal to 255.
- If the address contains exactly 4 segments, the function returns `true`, indicating a valid IPv4 address; otherwise, it returns `false`.

#### Step 3: `checkIPv6` Function
The `checkIPv6` function validates an IPv6 address.

```cpp
s += ':';
stringstream ss(s);
string str;
int n_mark = 0;
while(getline(ss, str, ':')) {
    if(str.size() < 1 || str.size() > 4)
        return false;
    for(char ip: str) {
        if((ip >= '0' && ip <= '9') || (ip >= 'a' && ip <= 'f') || (ip >= 'A' && ip <= 'F'))
            continue;
        else return false;
    }
    n_mark++;
}
if(n_mark != 8) return false;
return true;
```

- The function appends a colon (`:`) to the string `s` to simplify processing.
- It uses a `stringstream` to split the string by colons (`:`).
- Each part is checked:
  - The part must have a length between 1 and 4 characters.
  - The part must consist only of hexadecimal characters (0-9, a-f, A-F).
- The address must contain exactly 8 segments. If all conditions are met, it returns `true`, indicating a valid IPv6 address; otherwise, it returns `false`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The `validIPAddress` function processes each character of the input string exactly once. Thus, the time complexity for this function is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `queryIP`.
- The `checkIPv4` and `checkIPv6` functions iterate through the address segments, and each function processes each segment once, which is proportional to the number of segments (IPv4 has 4 segments, and IPv6 has 8 segments). Therefore, the time complexity for each of these functions is `O(m)`, where `m` is the number of segments.
- The overall time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string `queryIP`.

#### Space Complexity:
- The `checkIPv4` and `checkIPv6` functions use a `stringstream` and some auxiliary variables, which require `O(m)` space for each function.
- The space complexity of the entire solution is `O(m)`, where `m` is the number of segments.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently checks if a given IP address is valid as either an IPv4 or IPv6 address. The approach utilizes string parsing and basic validation rules for each address type. By handling both formats in separate functions (`checkIPv4` and `checkIPv6`), the solution ensures clear and concise code. The solution has a time complexity of `O(n)` and space complexity of `O(m)`, making it suitable for handling typical input sizes. This method is both efficient and easy to understand, ensuring the correct identification of valid IP addresses.
