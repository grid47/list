### Problem Statement
Given a set of intervals, for each interval, find the index of the rightmost interval that starts after the current interval ends. If there is no such interval, return -1 for that interval.

### Approach
1. **Mapping Start Times to Indices**:
   - Use a map to store the start times of intervals as keys and their corresponding indices as values.

2. **Finding Right Intervals**:
   - For each interval, determine if there exists a start time that is greater than or equal to the end time of the current interval.
   - Use `lower_bound` on the map to efficiently find the first interval that starts after the current interval ends.

3. **Result Compilation**:
   - If such an interval exists, retrieve its index; otherwise, assign -1 for that interval.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - A map (`mk`) is created to hold the start times and their corresponding indices.
   - A vector (`ans`) is initialized to store the results, filled with -1 initially.

2. **Populating the Map**:
   - Iterate through the intervals, storing the start times and indices in the map.

3. **Checking for Right Intervals**:
   - For each interval, use `lower_bound` to find the first entry in the map where the start time is greater than or equal to the end time of the current interval.

4. **Return Result**:
   - The populated result vector is returned, containing indices of the right intervals or -1.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N) due to the map operations, where N is the number of intervals.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the intervals and the map.
