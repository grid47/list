### Problem Statement

The problem is to find the maximum number of cherries that can be collected by two people starting at the top of a grid and moving to the bottom. Each person starts at different columns in the top row and can move down to the next row either directly downwards or diagonally left/right. The objective is to maximize the cherries collected while avoiding double counting cherries from the same cell if both persons land on it simultaneously.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach combined with memoization to optimize the computation. The key steps in the approach are as follows:

1. **State Representation**:
   - Each state in our recursive function can be defined by three parameters: the current row index (`r`), the column index of the first person (`c1`), and the column index of the second person (`c2`). This state uniquely defines the position of both persons in the grid.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the current row index (`r`) equals the number of rows in the grid (`m`), it indicates that both persons have reached the bottom of the grid. At this point, we return `0` since there are no more cherries to collect.

3. **Memoization**:
   - We maintain a 3D array `dp` where `dp[r][c1][c2]` stores the maximum cherries collected from the current state defined by the row and the columns of the two persons. If this state has been computed previously, we simply return the stored value to avoid redundant calculations.

4. **Recursive Exploration**:
   - For each state, we explore all possible moves for both persons. Each person can move downwards to the next row and can choose to stay in the same column, move left, or move right. We need to ensure that the new column indices (`nc1` and `nc2`) remain within the grid boundaries.

5. **Cherry Collection**:
   - After exploring all possible positions, we calculate the cherries collected in the current state. If both persons land on the same cell (`c1 == c2`), we collect cherries from that cell only once; otherwise, we sum the cherries collected from both cells.

6. **Result Compilation**:
   - Finally, we return the maximum cherries collected from the current state after exploring all possible moves.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the provided code:

1. **Class Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
   ```

   - The solution is encapsulated within a class named `Solution`, following standard practice in competitive programming.

2. **Global DP Array Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int dp[70][70][70] = {};
   ```

   - A 3D array `dp` is defined to store the maximum cherries collected for each state defined by the row index and the positions of the two persons.

3. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   int cherryPickup(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
   ```

   - The `cherryPickup` function takes a 2D vector `grid` as input, representing the cherry grid.

4. **DP Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
   ```

   - The `dp` array is initialized to `-1` to indicate that no state has been computed yet.

5. **Dimensions Extraction**:
   ```cpp
   int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
   ```

   - Variables `m` and `n` store the number of rows and columns of the grid, respectively.

6. **DFS Call**:
   ```cpp
   return dfs(grid, m, n, 0, 0, n - 1);
   ```

   - The recursive `dfs` function is invoked with initial parameters: starting at row `0`, the first person at column `0`, and the second person at the last column `n-1`.

7. **DFS Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int m, int n, int r, int c1, int c2) {
   ```

   - The `dfs` function performs the recursive cherry collection based on the current state.

8. **Base Case**:
   ```cpp
   if (r == m) return 0; // Reach to bottom row
   ```

   - If both persons reach the last row, we return `0`, as no cherries can be collected beyond this point.

9. **Memoization Check**:
   ```cpp
   if (dp[r][c1][c2] != -1) return dp[r][c1][c2];
   ```

   - We check if the result for the current state has already been computed. If it has, we return the stored value.

10. **Initialization of Maximum Cherries**:
    ```cpp
    int ans = 0;
    ```

    - A variable `ans` is initialized to keep track of the maximum cherries collected from the current state.

11. **Exploring Moves**:
    ```cpp
    for (int i = -1; i <= 1; i++) {
        for (int j = -1; j <= 1; j++) {
            int nc1 = c1 + i, nc2 = c2 + j;
            if (nc1 >= 0 && nc1 < n && nc2 >= 0 && nc2 < n) {
                ans = max(ans, dfs(grid, m, n, r + 1, nc1, nc2));
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    - Two nested loops iterate over possible moves for both persons. We calculate new column indices (`nc1` and `nc2`) and check if they are within the valid range. If valid, we recursively call `dfs` for the next row and update `ans` with the maximum cherries collected.

12. **Cherry Calculation**:
    ```cpp
    int cherries = c1 == c2 ? grid[r][c1] : grid[r][c1] + grid[r][c2];
    ```

    - The cherries collected are calculated based on whether both persons land on the same cell or different cells.

13. **Memoization Storage**:
    ```cpp
    return dp[r][c1][c2] = ans + cherries;
    ```

    - The computed result for the current state is stored in the `dp` array, and the total cherries collected from this state is returned.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \( O(m \cdot n^2) \), where \( m \) is the number of rows and \( n \) is the number of columns in the grid. The recursive DFS explores all combinations of the two persons’ movements.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \( O(m \cdot n^2) \) due to the `dp` array used for memoization.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the maximum number of cherries that can be collected by employing a DFS approach with memoization. The key components include:

1. **State Representation**: Using a 3D array to represent the state of the two persons allows us to handle their movements and cherry collection effectively.

2. **Memoization**: Storing previously computed results significantly reduces the number of redundant calculations, enhancing performance.

3. **Dynamic Exploration**: The ability to explore multiple paths and capture the maximum cherries collected demonstrates the versatility of recursion and dynamic programming in solving combinatorial optimization problems.

Overall, this approach is optimal and well-structured for the given problem, making it suitable for competitive programming scenarios where both time efficiency and clarity are critical.
