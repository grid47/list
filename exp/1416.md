### Problem Statement

The problem requires us to find the number of ways to split a given string `s` into a sequence of positive integers such that each integer does not exceed a specified integer `k`. The integers formed from the string must be valid, meaning they cannot start with '0' unless the integer itself is '0'. The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization. The key idea is to recursively explore all possible ways to split the string into valid integers and use memoization to store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations. Here’s a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Recursive Function**: Define a recursive function `dp(idx)` that returns the number of ways to split the substring starting from index `idx` in the string `s`.

2. **Base Cases**: 
   - If `idx` reaches the end of the string, return `1` since it indicates a valid partitioning.
   - If the character at `idx` is '0', return `0` since a valid integer cannot start with '0'.

3. **Memoization**: Use a memoization array to store results for previously computed indices to enhance performance and prevent re-computation.

4. **Substring Generation**: Iterate through the string starting from `idx`, constructing potential integers from the current index and checking if they are less than or equal to `k`. If they are valid, recursively call `dp` for the next index.

5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be large, perform calculations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let’s dissect the code implementation for better understanding:

1. **Class and Member Variables**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
       string s;
       int k;
       vector<int> memo;
       int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
   ```

   - The class `Solution` contains member variables for the input string `s`, the integer `k`, a memoization vector `memo`, and a constant `mod` for the modulo operation.

2. **Recursive Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
       int dp(int idx) {
           if(idx == s.size()) return 1;
           if(s[idx] == '0') return 0;
   ```

   - The method `dp` takes an index `idx` as input. 
   - If `idx` equals the length of the string `s`, it returns `1`, indicating a valid way to partition the string.
   - If the character at `idx` is '0', it returns `0` because no valid integer can start with '0'.

3. **Memoization Check**:
   ```cpp
           if(memo[idx] != -1) return memo[idx];
   ```

   - This line checks if the result for the current index `idx` has already been computed. If so, it returns the stored value to save computation time.

4. **Main Loop for Generating Integers**:
   ```cpp
           long num = 0;
           long ans = 0;
           for(int i = idx; i < s.size(); i++) {
               num = num * 10 + s[i] - '0';
               if(num > k) break;
               ans += dp(i + 1);
               ans %= mod;
           }
   ```

   - The variables `num` and `ans` are initialized to zero. 
   - The loop iterates from `idx` to the end of the string, constructing integers by appending digits.
   - If `num` exceeds `k`, the loop breaks as further numbers will only be larger.
   - For each valid number, it recursively calls `dp` for the next index `i + 1`, adds the result to `ans`, and applies the modulo operation.

5. **Store Result in Memoization Array**:
   ```cpp
           return memo[idx] = ans % mod;
       }
   ```

   - The computed result for the current index `idx` is stored in `memo` before returning.

6. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
       int numberOfArrays(string s, int k) {
           this->s = s;
           this->k = k;
           memo.resize(s.size(), -1);
           return dp(0);
       }
   ```

   - The method `numberOfArrays` initializes the member variables and resizes the `memo` array to the size of the string `s`.
   - It starts the recursive process by calling `dp(0)` to count the number of valid partitions from the beginning of the string.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The worst-case time complexity is \( O(n^2) \) where \( n \) is the length of the string `s`. In the inner loop, we check each substring which could potentially result in \( n(n+1)/2 \) checks.
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \( O(n) \) due to the memoization array storing results for each index in the string.

### Conclusion

The `numberOfArrays` function efficiently calculates the number of ways to split the input string `s` into valid integers that do not exceed `k` using a dynamic programming approach with memoization. This method significantly reduces redundant computations and effectively handles large input sizes.

#### Key Takeaways:

- **Dynamic Programming**: This problem highlights how dynamic programming can be utilized to optimize problems that involve recursive counting and overlapping subproblems.
- **Memoization**: Storing intermediate results is a powerful technique to enhance performance and efficiency in recursive solutions.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution considers edge cases, such as leading zeros, ensuring that the generated numbers are always valid.

Overall, the provided solution is a well-structured approach to solving the problem, demonstrating effective use of recursion and memoization in a dynamic programming context.
