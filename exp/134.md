### Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays, `gas` and `cost`. Each index represents a gas station where:
- `gas[i]` is the amount of gas available at station `i`.
- `cost[i]` is the amount of gas required to travel from station `i` to the next station.

The goal is to determine the starting gas station index from which you can travel around the circuit once without running out of gas. If no such station exists, return -1.

### Approach
1. **Total Gas Check**:
   - Calculate the total amount of gas available and the total cost required to complete the circuit.
   - If the total cost is greater than the total gas, return -1, as it's impossible to complete the circuit.

2. **Finding the Starting Point**:
   - Traverse through each gas station, maintaining a running total of the current gas in the tank (`tank`).
   - If the tank goes below zero, reset it to zero and update the starting station index (`res`) to the next station.
   - The first station where the gas is sufficient to cover the cost will be the starting station.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 5-8**: Calculate the total gas and total cost. If the total cost exceeds total gas, return -1.
- **Line 10**: Reset `tank` for the second pass to find the starting index.
- **Line 11**: Initialize `res` to store the index of the last station that failed.
- **Line 13-19**: Loop through each gas station, updating the `tank` and checking if it drops below zero. If it does, reset the `tank` and set `res` to the current index.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of gas stations, as we traverse the list twice.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
