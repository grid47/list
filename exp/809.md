### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and a list of words, the goal is to count how many of the words can be formed from `s` by stretching some characters. A character can be stretched if it appears consecutively in `s` at least three times.

### Approach
1. **Iterate Through Words**:
   - For each word in the list, check if it can be formed from `s` by calling the `check` function.

2. **Check Function**:
   - Compare each character in `s` with the characters in the word `w`.
   - Use two pointers, `i` for `s` and `j` for `w`, to traverse both strings.
   - For each character in `s`:
     - If the current characters match, move both pointers forward.
     - If characters do not match, check if the current character in `s` can be stretched:
       - If the previous two characters in `s` are the same as the current character, the character can be stretched.
       - If the current character is part of a triplet (e.g., `aaa`), it can also be stretched.
       - If neither condition holds, return `false`.
   - After traversing `s`, check if all characters in `w` have been matched.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return the count of words that can be formed from `s`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains methods to compute the count of expressive words.
    - `int expressiveWords(string s, vector<string>& words)`: The main function to count the expressive words.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `s`: The string to stretch.
        - `words`: A list of words to check against `s`.
      - **Returns**: An integer representing the count of expressive words.
    - `bool check(string s, string w)`: A helper function to check if a word can be formed by stretching `s`.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `s`: The string to stretch.
        - `w`: The word to check.
      - **Returns**: A boolean indicating whether the word can be formed from `s`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the average length of words in the list, due to the nested iteration over the words.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since no additional space is used other than variables for iteration.
