### Problem Statement

The problem is to calculate the sum of subarray sums within a given range in a list of integers. Specifically, we need to find the sum of the smallest sums of the subarrays in sorted order between two indices, `left` and `right`, after sorting all the subarray sums. The final result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can break it down into the following steps:

1. **Generate All Subarray Sums**: For a given array of integers, compute the sums of all possible subarrays.

2. **Store Subarray Sums**: Store these sums in a list.

3. **Sort the Sums**: Once all sums are computed, sort the list of sums to arrange them in non-decreasing order.

4. **Calculate the Final Sum**: Sum the values between the `left` and `right` indices in the sorted list and return this sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
```
- We begin by defining a class `Solution` and declaring a member variable `mod`, which will be used to ensure our results remain within the bounds of standard integer sizes by applying the modulus operation with \(10^9 + 7\).

```cpp
    int rangeSum(vector<int>& nums, int n, int left, int right) {
```
- The method `rangeSum` is defined, which takes a vector of integers `nums`, its size `n`, and the range defined by `left` and `right`.

```cpp
        vector<int> ans;
```
- We declare a vector `ans` to store the sums of all subarrays.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
```
- We use a nested loop structure. The outer loop iterates through each starting index `i` of the subarray.

```cpp
            for(int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                sum = (sum + nums[j]) % mod;                
                ans.push_back(sum);
            }
        }
```
- The inner loop iterates from the starting index `i` to the end of the array, maintaining a cumulative sum of the elements.
- Each cumulative sum is added to the `ans` vector. The use of modulus ensures that the sum does not overflow during the addition.

```cpp
        sort(ans.begin(), ans.end());
```
- After generating all possible subarray sums, we sort the vector `ans` to prepare it for the next step.

```cpp
        int res = 0;
```
- We initialize a variable `res` to store the final result.

```cpp
        for(int i = left - 1; i < right; i++)
            res = (res + ans[i]) % mod;
```
- We loop through the indices from `left - 1` to `right - 1` (since the problem statement uses 1-based indexing).
- Each element in this range is added to `res`, applying the modulus operation to keep the result manageable.

```cpp
        return res;
    }
};
```
- Finally, we return the result `res`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^2 \log(n))\). 
  - \(O(n^2)\) arises from generating all subarray sums, as we have a nested loop iterating through the array.
  - Sorting the subarray sums takes \(O(m \log(m))\), where \(m\) is the number of subarrays (approximately \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\)).
  
#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is \(O(m)\), which is the space used to store the subarray sums in the `ans` vector.

### Conclusion

The solution effectively calculates the sum of subarray sums within a specified range by systematically generating all subarrays, storing their sums, and then processing these sums. 

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Cumulative Sums**: Using cumulative sums allows for efficient calculation of subarray sums by progressively adding elements.
- **Sorting**: Sorting is crucial in obtaining the required order of sums, enabling the selection of specific ranges.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: Applying the modulus operation prevents overflow and keeps the result within acceptable limits.

This approach illustrates a fundamental strategy in algorithm designâ€”breaking down a complex problem into manageable parts, utilizing nested loops for combinatorial generation, and leveraging sorting for efficient retrieval. The problem exemplifies common techniques applicable in various algorithmic contexts, particularly in competitive programming scenarios where efficiency and clarity are paramount.
