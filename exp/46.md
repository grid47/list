### Problem Statement
The task is to generate all possible permutations of a given vector of integers, ensuring that each permutation is unique, even if there are duplicate integers in the input.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a map (`mp`) to track the integers that have already been included in the current permutation to avoid duplicates.
   - Create a vector (`ans`) to store all the generated permutations.
   - Use a temporary vector (`tmp`) to build each permutation.

2. **Backtracking Function**:
   - Define a helper function `bt` that will perform the backtracking to generate permutations.
   - The function takes the current state of permutations (`ans`), the current temporary permutation (`tmp`), the original input vector (`nums`), the current index (`idx`), and the map (`mp`).

3. **Base Case**:
   - If the current index equals the size of `nums`, it indicates a complete permutation, which should be added to `ans`.

4. **Recursive Case**:
   - Loop through each integer in `nums`.
   - Skip integers that are already included in the current permutation (checked via `mp`).
   - Add the integer to `tmp`, mark it in `mp`, and recursively call `bt` to continue building the permutation.
   - After returning from the recursive call, remove the integer from `tmp` and mark it as unused in `mp`.

5. **Return Result**:
   - After the backtracking completes, return the vector `ans`, which contains all unique permutations.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `permute` function takes a vector of integers `nums`.

2. **Variables**:
   - `mp`: A map to keep track of used integers in the current permutation.
   - `ans`: A vector to store all unique permutations.
   - `tmp`: A temporary vector to build the current permutation.

3. **Backtracking Logic**:
   - The loop iterates through `nums`, checking if each integer has already been used in the current permutation.
   - After exploring a number, it backtracks by removing it from the temporary vector and marking it as unused.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \times n!)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`. The \(n!\) factor accounts for all permutations, and each permutation takes \(O(n)\) to construct.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the temporary vector and the recursion stack, where \(n\) is the depth of recursion (equal to the number of elements).
