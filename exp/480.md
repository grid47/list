### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the median of the sliding window of size `k` over the array.

### Approach
1. **Using a Multiset**:
   - A `multiset` is used to maintain the current window of size `k`. This allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and median retrieval.

2. **Calculating the Median**:
   - The median can be found based on whether `k` is odd or even:
     - If `k` is odd, the median is the middle element.
     - If `k` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

3. **Sliding the Window**:
   - Start by populating the `multiset` with the first `k` elements.
   - For each new element added to the window, calculate the median and adjust the window:
     - Insert the new element into the `multiset`.
     - Remove the element that is sliding out of the window.
     - Update the `mid` iterator to point to the current median.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Collect the medians for all sliding windows in a result vector and return it.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `medianSlidingWindow()` takes a vector of integers `nums` and an integer `k` as input.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize a `multiset` with the first `k` elements of `nums`.
   - Set an iterator `mid` to the middle of the `multiset`.

3. **Sliding Window Loop**:
   - For each new index starting from `k`, calculate the current median using the `mid` iterator.
   - Insert the new element and adjust the `mid` if necessary based on the inserted value.
   - Erase the element that is sliding out of the window.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing all elements, return the vector of medians.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log k) due to the insertion and deletion in the `multiset`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k) for the `multiset` storing the current window of elements.
