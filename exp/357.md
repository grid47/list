### Problem Statement

The problem at hand requires counting how many numbers with **unique digits** can be formed, given an integer `n` representing the number of digits. The task is to compute the number of possible numbers that can be formed using the digits from 0 to 9, with each number having `n` digits, where no digit repeats.

For example:
- When `n = 2`, the number of valid numbers with unique digits includes numbers like 12, 13, 21, etc. (without repeating digits like 11, 22).
- When `n = 3`, the number of valid 3-digit numbers should exclude any numbers with repeated digits, such as 101, 121, etc.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we will take the following approach:

1. **Single Digit Numbers**:
   - For `n = 1`, all digits from 0 to 9 are possible. Thus, there are 10 such numbers (0 through 9).
   
2. **Multiple Digit Numbers**:
   - For numbers with more than one digit, the main challenge is ensuring that no digit repeats.
   - We can break the problem down by calculating the possible choices for each digit, starting from the most significant digit to the least significant.
   
   - For the first digit:
     - We have 9 possible choices (1 through 9) because 0 cannot be the leading digit.
   
   - For the second digit:
     - We have 9 choices (0 through 9, excluding the digit already chosen for the first place).
   
   - For the third digit:
     - We have 8 choices (0 through 9, excluding the two digits already chosen for the first and second places).
   
   - Continuing this pattern, the number of available choices decreases by 1 as each new digit is added.
   
   - We stop when the number of digits (`n`) is reached, and the total number of valid numbers is the sum of all the possibilities from 1 digit up to `n` digits.

3. **Edge Case**:
   - If `n = 0`, the problem specifies returning 1, as there is exactly one number with zero digits, which can be considered as the empty set.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

The code can be broken down into the following steps:

#### Step 1: Handle Base Case (`n = 0`)

```java
if (n == 0) return 1;
```
- If `n` is 0, we return 1. This represents the fact that there is exactly one number with zero digits, the empty number.

#### Step 2: Initialize Variables

```java
int res = 10;      // Start with the 10 valid 1-digit numbers (0 through 9)
int available = 9;  // There are 9 options available for the first digit (1 to 9)
int unqNums = 9;   // The number of possible numbers that can be formed with the first digit
```
- We initialize `res` to 10 because there are 10 valid 1-digit numbers (0 to 9).
- `available` represents the number of available digits for the first digit (which is 9 since we cannot have 0 as the leading digit).
- `unqNums` is used to accumulate the number of valid unique-digit numbers as we process each additional digit.

#### Step 3: Loop Through Remaining Digits

```java
while (n-- > 1 && available > 0) {
    unqNums = unqNums * available;  // Calculate the number of unique numbers for the current number of digits
    res += unqNums;                 // Add this count to the result
    available--;                    // Decrease the available options for the next digit
}
```
- This loop runs for every additional digit from 2 to `n`. For each digit:
  - We calculate the number of valid numbers that can be formed with the current number of digits. This is done by multiplying the number of valid numbers from the previous step by the number of available options for the current digit (`available`).
  - We add this new count to `res`, which accumulates the total number of valid unique-digit numbers.
  - We then decrease the number of available choices for the next digit by 1 (`available--`).

#### Step 4: Return the Result

```java
return res;
```
- After the loop completes, we return the final result, which is the total number of valid numbers with unique digits for the given `n`.

### Example Walkthrough

Letâ€™s walk through an example where `n = 3`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `res = 10` (10 valid 1-digit numbers: 0 through 9).
   - `available = 9` (9 choices for the first digit: 1 through 9).
   - `unqNums = 9` (There are 9 possible 1-digit numbers with unique digits).

2. **First Loop (n = 2)**:
   - Calculate the number of valid 2-digit numbers.
   - For the first digit, we have 9 options (1 to 9).
   - For the second digit, we have 9 options (0 through 9, excluding the first digit).
   - `unqNums = 9 * 9 = 81`.
   - Add 81 to `res`: `res = 10 + 81 = 91`.

3. **Second Loop (n = 3)**:
   - Calculate the number of valid 3-digit numbers.
   - For the first digit, we have 9 options (1 to 9).
   - For the second digit, we have 9 options (0 through 9, excluding the first digit).
   - For the third digit, we have 8 options (0 through 9, excluding the first two digits).
   - `unqNums = 81 * 8 = 648`.
   - Add 648 to `res`: `res = 91 + 648 = 739`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The total number of unique digit numbers for `n = 3` is `739`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of digits. This is because we iterate from 2 up to `n` in the while loop. Each iteration involves constant-time operations like multiplication and addition.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(1)** because the solution only uses a few integer variables (`res`, `available`, `unqNums`) regardless of the input size `n`. No additional space is used to store data structures that grow with the size of `n`.

### Conclusion

This code efficiently counts the number of valid numbers with unique digits for any given `n`. The use of the loop with progressively reduced choices for each digit ensures that we accurately compute the number of possibilities without having to explicitly generate all possible numbers. The solution is optimal in terms of both time and space complexity, making it suitable for large values of `n`.
