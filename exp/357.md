### Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer \( n \), return the count of all numbers with unique digits that can be formed by digits from 0 to 9. The numbers can have at most \( n \) digits, and we want to count all such numbers including leading zeros.

### Approach
1. **Base Case**:
   - If \( n = 0 \), the only number possible is 0 itself, so return 1.

2. **Counting Unique Digit Numbers**:
   - Initialize `res` to 10 to count the numbers with 1 digit (0-9).
   - Use two variables:
     - `available`: Represents the number of digits available for choosing unique digits. Starts at 9 (digits 1-9) after the first digit (0) is counted.
     - `unqNums`: Tracks the count of unique digit numbers that can be formed with the remaining available digits.
   - For each additional digit (up to \( n \)):
     - Calculate the number of unique digits that can be chosen using `unqNums` and multiply it by the available digits.
     - Add the result to `res` and decrease the `available` count.
   - Stop when \( n \) reaches 1 or when no available digits are left.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - The final result is the accumulated count of unique digit numbers.

### Code Walk-through
- The code starts with checking if \( n \) is 0. If so, it returns 1.
- It initializes `res` to account for all single-digit unique numbers.
- It uses a loop to compute the count of unique digit numbers for each digit count from 2 to \( n \).
- The loop terminates when there are no more unique digits available to use.
- Finally, it returns the total count.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \) since we iterate \( n \) times to calculate the counts.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \) as we use a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
