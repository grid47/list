### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is between `1` and `n` (inclusive), there is only one duplicate number in the array. The goal is to find the duplicate number without modifying the array and using constant extra space.

### Approach
The solution uses Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection) algorithm to identify the duplicate number:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.

2. **Finding the Intersection Point**:
   - Start with `slow` at `nums[0]` and `fast` at `nums[nums[0]]`.
   - Continue moving `slow` and `fast` until they meet. This meeting point indicates that there is a cycle in the array, which is caused by the duplicate number.

3. **Finding the Entrance to the Cycle**:
   - Once the two pointers meet, reset `fast` to `0` (the start of the array).
   - Move both `slow` and `fast` one step at a time. The point where they meet again is the duplicate number.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A vector of integers `nums`.
- **Output**: The duplicate number in the array.

1. Initialize `slow` and `fast` to start in the array.
2. Use a while loop to move the pointers until they meet.
3. Reset `fast` to `0` and continue moving both pointers until they meet again.
4. Return the value of the `fast` pointer, which will be the duplicate number.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) since both pointers traverse the list at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) as no additional space is used aside from the pointers.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Input**: If `nums` contains only two elements, both being the same, the duplicate is immediately identified.
2. **Multiple Duplicates**: The algorithm guarantees to find one duplicate since the problem states there is only one duplicate number in the array.
