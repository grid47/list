### Problem Statement
Given a linked list and a value `x`, partition the linked list such that all nodes with values less than `x` come before nodes with values greater than or equal to `x`. The order of nodes in each partition should be preserved.

### Approach
1. **Create Two Dummy Nodes**:
   - Use two dummy nodes to create two separate linked lists:
     - One for nodes with values less than `x` (let's call it `p1`).
     - Another for nodes with values greater than or equal to `x` (let's call it `p2`).

2. **Traverse the Original List**:
   - Iterate through the original linked list.
   - For each node, check its value:
     - If it's less than `x`, add it to the `p1` list.
     - If it's greater than or equal to `x`, add it to the `p2` list.

3. **Combine the Two Lists**:
   - After traversing the original list, connect the `p1` list to the `p2` list by setting the `next` pointer of the last node of `p1` to the head of the `p2` list.

4. **Return the New List**:
   - The head of the newly partitioned list is the node next to the dummy head of `p1`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Two dummy nodes `p1` and `p2` are initialized to help build the two separate lists.
   - A pointer `ans` points to the start of the first list.

2. **Building Lists**:
   - While traversing the input linked list, nodes are added to `p1` or `p2` based on their values relative to `x`.

3. **Connecting Lists**:
   - Finally, connect the last node of the `p1` list to the head of the `p2` list and return the combined list starting from `ans->next`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the linked list since each node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \) for storing new nodes in the two lists. However, the original nodes are not modified; only new nodes are created, leading to additional space usage.
