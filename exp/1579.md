### Problem Statement

The problem involves managing a network of nodes represented as an undirected graph, where edges can have different types. Specifically, there are three types of edges: type 1, type 2, and type 3. The objective is to maximize the number of edges that can be removed while still ensuring that the graph remains fully connected with the remaining edges. The challenge lies in the constraints and interactions between the different types of edges.

### Approach

To tackle this problem, we will use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure to efficiently manage and connect components of the graph. Here's a high-level breakdown of the approach:

1. **Sort Edges**: Begin by sorting the edges in descending order based on their type. Type 3 edges are prioritized, as they can connect nodes regardless of type. This will allow us to first attempt to use the most versatile edges.

2. **Initialize Union-Find Structures**: We will create two Union-Find instances:
   - One to manage the connections made by all types of edges (denoted as `a`).
   - Another to manage connections made specifically by type 2 edges (denoted as `b`).

3. **Process Edges**: Iterate through the sorted edges and use the Union-Find structure to connect nodes:
   - For type 3 edges, attempt to connect the two nodes in both Union-Find instances. If they are already connected, count this edge as removable.
   - For type 1 edges, only connect them in the first Union-Find instance.
   - For type 2 edges, only connect them in the second Union-Find instance.

4. **Check Connectivity**: After processing all edges, check if both Union-Find structures indicate that all nodes are connected. If they are, return the number of removable edges; otherwise, return -1 indicating that it's impossible to keep all nodes connected.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's examine the code closely to see how it implements the above approach.

#### Union-Find Class

```cpp
class UF {
public:
    vector<int> a;
    int grp;
    UF(int n) {
        a.resize(n + 1);
        grp = n;
        iota(a.begin(), a.end(), 0);
    }
```

- **Data Structure**: The `UF` class contains:
  - A vector `a` that represents the parent of each node.
  - An integer `grp` that tracks the number of connected components.

- **Constructor**: Initializes the parent of each node to itself and sets the group count.

#### Join and Connection Functions

```cpp
bool join(int x, int y) {
    int p = find(x);
    int q = find(y);
    if(p != q) {
        a[p] = q;
        grp--;
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

- **Join Function**: Merges the sets containing nodes `x` and `y`. If they are already connected, it returns false; otherwise, it connects them and decrements the group count.

```cpp
bool conn(int x, int y) {
    return find(x) == find(y);
}
```

- **Connection Check**: Determines if two nodes are in the same connected component.

```cpp
int find(int x) {
    return a[x] == x ? x : (a[x] = find(a[x]));
}
```

- **Find Function**: Implements path compression for efficiency. It returns the root of the node and updates the parent of each node in the path to point directly to the root.

#### Main Solution Class

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxNumEdgesToRemove(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        sort(edges.rbegin(), edges.rend());
        UF a = UF(n), b = UF(n);
        int res = 0;
```

- **Sorting Edges**: Edges are sorted in reverse order to prioritize type 3 edges. Two Union-Find instances `a` and `b` are created to manage connections for all types and specifically for type 2 edges, respectively.

#### Processing Edges

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < edges.size(); i++) {
    if(edges[i][0] == 3) {
        if(!a.conn(edges[i][1], edges[i][2])) {
            a.join(edges[i][1], edges[i][2]);
            b.join(edges[i][1], edges[i][2]);
        } else res++;
    } else if(edges[i][0] == 1) {
        if(!a.conn(edges[i][1], edges[i][2])) {
            a.join(edges[i][1], edges[i][2]);
        } else res++;
    } else if(edges[i][0] == 2) {
        if(!b.conn(edges[i][1], edges[i][2])) {
            b.join(edges[i][1], edges[i][2]);
        } else res++;
    }
}
```

- **Edge Processing**: For each edge, depending on its type, the appropriate connection logic is executed:
  - **Type 3**: Attempt to connect in both Union-Find instances and count as removable if already connected.
  - **Type 1**: Connect only in `a`.
  - **Type 2**: Connect only in `b`.

#### Final Connectivity Check

```cpp
if(a.grp == 1 && b.grp == 1) return res;
return -1;
```

- **Checking Connectivity**: After processing all edges, if both Union-Find instances indicate that all nodes are connected (i.e., only one group exists), return the count of removable edges. If not, return -1.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Sorting the edges takes \( O(E \log E) \), where \( E \) is the number of edges.
  - The edge processing involves iterating through \( E \) edges with nearly constant time for Union-Find operations due to path compression, resulting in an overall complexity of \( O(E \log E) \).

- **Space Complexity**: 
  - The space complexity is \( O(N) \) for the Union-Find structure where \( N \) is the number of nodes.

### Conclusion

This implementation effectively utilizes the Union-Find data structure to manage and analyze the connectivity of a graph with multiple types of edges. The approach not only maximizes the number of removable edges but also ensures that the graph remains fully connected. The careful ordering of edges and efficient handling through the Union-Find class demonstrate solid algorithmic principles applicable in network design and connectivity problems. 

By understanding the nuances of this solution, developers can enhance their skills in handling graph-related challenges, particularly those involving edge management and connectivity constraints. This approach serves as a robust framework for tackling various problems in competitive programming and real-world scenarios involving network connectivity.
