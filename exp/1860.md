### Problem Statement

The problem is to determine the point at which two memory banks, `mem1` and `mem2`, will run out of memory when allocating memory sequentially. Each round of memory allocation consists of allocating an increasing amount of memory starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 in each subsequent round. The allocation should always occur in the bank that has enough memory available, and when a bank runs out of memory, the process stops. The goal is to find out how many rounds of memory allocation can be performed before one or both memory banks can no longer accommodate the next allocation. The function should return a vector containing the total number of allocation rounds completed, along with the remaining memory in both banks.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can follow a straightforward simulation approach:

1. **Initialization**: Start with a round counter initialized to 1. This counter will track how many allocation rounds have been completed.

2. **Memory Allocation Simulation**: Use a while loop that continues as long as at least one of the memory banks has sufficient memory to accommodate the current round's allocation. 

3. **Determine Which Bank to Allocate From**: In each iteration, compare the available memory in both banks. Allocate memory from the bank that has more available memory. If both banks have equal memory available, prioritize `mem1`.

4. **Update Remaining Memory**: Subtract the allocated amount from the respective bank's available memory.

5. **Increment the Round Counter**: Increase the round counter for the next allocation.

6. **Return the Result**: Once a round cannot be completed due to insufficient memory in both banks, return a vector containing the total rounds completed, and the remaining memory in both banks.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Class Definition**: The implementation begins by defining a class named `Solution`, which houses the main method.

    ```cpp
    class Solution {
    public:
    ```

2. **Method Declaration**: We define a public method `memLeak` that takes two integers as input parameters representing the initial memory of each bank.

    ```cpp
    vector<int> memLeak(int mem1, int mem2) {
    ```

3. **Round Counter Initialization**: We initialize an integer variable `i` to 1, which will represent the current round of memory allocation.

    ```cpp
    int i = 1;
    ```

4. **Memory Allocation Simulation**: We enter a while loop that checks whether either `mem1` or `mem2` has enough memory to accommodate the current allocation (`i`).

    ```cpp
    while(i <= mem1 || i <= mem2) {
    ```

5. **Conditional Allocation**: Inside the loop, we use a conditional statement to determine from which memory bank to allocate. If `mem1` has greater or equal memory compared to `mem2`, we allocate from `mem1`; otherwise, we allocate from `mem2`.

    ```cpp
    if(mem1 >= mem2) {
        mem1 -= i; // Allocate from mem1
    } else {
        mem2 -= i; // Allocate from mem2
    }
    ```

6. **Increment Round Counter**: After performing the allocation, we increment the round counter `i` for the next allocation round.

    ```cpp
    i++;
    ```

7. **Returning the Result**: Once the loop completes (when neither memory bank can accommodate the next allocation), we return a vector containing the total rounds completed (`i`), and the remaining memory in both banks.

    ```cpp
    return vector<int>{i, mem1, mem2};
    }
    ```

### Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(\sqrt{n})\), where \(n\) is the maximum of `mem1` and `mem2`. This is due to the nature of the allocation, as the amount of memory allocated increases linearly with each iteration. The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are only using a fixed number of variables for computations.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the provided code efficiently simulates memory allocation from two memory banks, keeping track of how many rounds of allocation can be performed until neither bank can accommodate the next required allocation. This solution is both intuitive and straightforward, leveraging a simple loop and conditionals to manage the allocation logic. By returning the number of rounds and the remaining memory in each bank, the code effectively meets the problem's requirements while ensuring clarity and efficiency. This implementation serves as a good example of managing resource allocation problems and can be extended or modified to address similar challenges in memory management and allocation scenarios. Overall, it exemplifies effective problem-solving techniques within the realm of programming and algorithm design.
