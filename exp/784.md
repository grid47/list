### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, return all possible permutations of its letters where each letter can be either lowercase or uppercase. The output should not include duplicates.

### Approach
1. **Backtracking**:
   - Use a backtracking technique to explore all possible combinations of letter cases.
   - Recursively generate the permutations by either keeping the current character as it is or toggling its case (if it's a letter).

2. **Base Case**:
   - When the index `i` reaches the size of the string `s`, add the current permutation to the result list.

3. **Case Toggling**:
   - For each character in the string, if it is alphabetic, toggle its case using bitwise operations.

### Code Walk-through
- **Methods**:
  - `vector<string> letterCasePermutation(string s)`: Main function that initializes the answer vector and starts the backtracking process.
  - `void bt(vector<string> &ans, string &s, int i)`: Helper function that performs the backtracking.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `ans`: Vector to store all valid permutations.
      - `s`: The string being modified.
      - `i`: The current index being processed.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n), where n is the length of the string, since each letter can be either lowercase or uppercase, leading to a binary branching.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the space used in the recursion stack and for storing the permutations in the output vector.
