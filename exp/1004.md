### Problem Statement
The problem at hand is to find the longest contiguous subarray within a binary array (`nums`) consisting only of `1`s, where we are allowed to flip at most `k` `0`s to `1`s. This is a common problem encountered in coding interviews and algorithm challenges that tests the candidateâ€™s ability to manipulate and traverse arrays effectively.

### Approach
To solve this problem, we will employ a sliding window technique. This approach allows us to dynamically adjust the size of our window (or subarray) while maintaining the conditions required for our solution. We will maintain a count of `0`s within our current window and ensure that it does not exceed `k`. If it does exceed `k`, we will shift the left side of the window to the right until the condition is satisfied again.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)
1. **Initialization**:
   - We declare an array `cnt[2]` to keep track of the counts of `0`s and `1`s in the current window.
   - We initialize `res` to store the result, representing the maximum length of valid subarrays found, and `j`, which serves as the left boundary of our window.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - We use a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the input vector `nums` using the variable `i`, which represents the right boundary of the window.

3. **Count Current Element**:
   - For each element `nums[i]`, we increment the corresponding count in our `cnt` array. If the element is `0`, `cnt[0]` is incremented; if it's `1`, `cnt[1]` is incremented.

4. **Adjust the Window**:
   - We enter a `while` loop that checks if the count of `0`s exceeds `k`. If it does, we need to move the left boundary `j` to the right until the count of `0`s is within the allowed limit.
   - In this loop, we decrement the count for the element at `nums[j]` (which is leaving the window) and increment `j` to effectively "remove" that element from our current window.

5. **Update Result**:
   - After adjusting the window, we calculate the length of the current valid subarray as `(i - j + 1)` and update `res` to be the maximum of its current value and this newly calculated length.

6. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, we return the maximum length found, which is stored in `res`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because both `i` and `j` traverse the array at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) as we are only using a fixed amount of additional space (the `cnt` array).

### Conclusion
The sliding window technique effectively optimizes the process of finding the longest contiguous subarray of `1`s in a binary array with a limited number of `0`s allowed to be flipped. This algorithm is efficient and easy to implement, making it a valuable tool for solving similar problems related to array manipulation. Understanding this approach can help in tackling a variety of problems that involve finding subarrays or substrings under certain constraints.
