### Problem Statement:

In this problem, you are given a series of falling squares, each represented by a position `[left, side_length]`, where:
- `left` represents the x-coordinate of the left edge of the square.
- `side_length` represents the side length of the square.

Each square falls on a 2D plane, starting from a vertical position defined by its bottom edge. As the squares fall, they can potentially stack on top of previously fallen squares.

Your task is to determine the maximum height of the topmost point of the squares after each square falls, in the order they appear in the input.

The goal is to return an array of maximum heights after each square falls.

### Approach:

This problem can be solved efficiently by simulating the falling of the squares while maintaining information about the positions and heights of the previously fallen squares. To track the height of the squares, we will use the following approach:

1. **Tracking Previous Squares**:
   We will maintain an array `past` which stores information about each previously fallen square in the format `[left, right, height]`, where:
   - `left`: x-coordinate of the left edge.
   - `right`: x-coordinate of the right edge.
   - `height`: the height of the square at that position.

2. **Calculating New Heights**:
   When a new square falls, we need to check if it overlaps with any previously fallen square. The height of the new square will be determined by the highest square it overlaps with. If the square does not overlap with any previous square, it falls at the base level (height 0).

3. **Max Height Calculation**:
   After each square falls, we calculate the maximum height reached by the topmost point of the square, and store this in an output array `ans`.

4. **Efficient Search for Overlaps**:
   The key part of this solution is efficiently determining the maximum height of squares that overlap with the current square. We use a helper function `search` to check if the current square overlaps with any previous squares and to find the maximum height of the overlapping squares.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step):

The code consists of two main components:
1. The `fallingSquares` function which processes the falling squares and calculates the maximum heights.
2. The `search` function which checks for overlaps and determines the maximum height of the current square.

#### `fallingSquares` Function:
```cpp
vector<int> fallingSquares(vector<vector<int>>& pos) {
    vector<vector<int>> past;  // To store previously fallen squares' data
    vector<int> ans;           // To store the resulting maximum heights after each square falls
    int h = 0;                 // To track the maximum height seen so far

    // Iterate through each square in the input
    for (vector<int> i : pos) {
        vector<int> cur = {i[0], i[0] + i[1] - 1, i[1]};  // Define the current square with [left, right, height]
        
        // Find the maximum height of squares it overlaps with using the search function
        int res = search(past, cur);
        
        // Update the maximum height seen so far
        h = max(h, res);
        
        // Add the result (max height) after the current square falls
        ans.push_back(h);
    }

    return ans;  // Return the list of maximum heights
}
```

- **Initialization**: We initialize the `past` array to store previously fallen squares, the `ans` array to store the maximum heights, and a variable `h` to keep track of the highest point reached so far.
  
- **Processing Each Square**: 
  For each square in the input:
  - We create the `cur` vector to represent the square's position and height. The `left` position is the first element in `i`, and the `right` is calculated as `i[0] + i[1] - 1`. The height of the square is `i[1]` (its side length).
  
- **Search for Maximum Overlap Height**:
  We call the `search` function to determine the height of the current square after considering any overlap with previous squares.

- **Update Maximum Height**: 
  We update the `h` variable with the result from the `search` function, which gives the highest point the current square reaches.

- **Storing the Result**: After each square falls, the maximum height is stored in `ans`.

#### `search` Function:
```cpp
int search(vector<vector<int>>& past, vector<int>& cur) {
    int mx = 0;  // To track the maximum height of overlapping squares
    
    // Iterate over all previously fallen squares
    for (auto i : past) {
        // If there is no overlap between the current square and past square, skip it
        if (cur[1] < i[0] || cur[0] > i[1]) continue;

        // If there is overlap, update the maximum height
        mx = max(mx, i[2]);
    }
    
    // Set the height of the current square based on the maximum height of overlapping squares
    cur[2] += mx;

    // Add the current square's information to the past list
    past.push_back(cur);

    return cur[2];  // Return the height of the current square after considering overlaps
}
```

- **Overlap Check**:
  The function iterates through each square in the `past` array and checks if the current square overlaps with any of the past squares. The condition `if (cur[1] < i[0] || cur[0] > i[1])` ensures that we skip squares that do not overlap with the current one.

- **Updating Maximum Height**:
  If the squares overlap, we update the `mx` variable to store the maximum height of the overlapping squares (`mx = max(mx, i[2])`).

- **Height Calculation**:
  After determining the maximum height of the overlapping squares, we update the current squareâ€™s height by adding the maximum height (`cur[2] += mx`).

- **Storing the Square**:
  The current square is then added to the `past` list to be considered for future squares.

### Complexity:

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(N^2)**, where `N` is the number of squares in the input `pos`. This is because for each square, we need to check its overlap with all previously fallen squares, which results in a nested loop.
  - The outer loop runs `N` times (for each square in the input).
  - The inner loop (the search function) checks each square in the `past` array, which can be up to `N` in size.
  
Thus, the total time complexity is **O(N^2)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(N)** because the `past` array stores the information of all squares that have fallen. In the worst case, all squares may fall without any overlap, and hence the space used by `past` will be proportional to the number of squares.

### Conclusion:

This solution effectively simulates the falling squares and tracks the maximum height of each square after each fall. It ensures that overlapping squares are correctly considered, and the maximum height is updated accordingly. While the time complexity of **O(N^2)** may not be optimal for very large inputs, it provides a simple and direct approach to solving the problem. This approach is suitable for cases where the number of falling squares is moderate, and it efficiently computes the result for each step in the sequence.
