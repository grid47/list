### Problem Statement
You are given a series of squares represented by their positions and sizes on a 1D plane. Each square is defined by its left edge, its side length, and you need to determine the heights of the squares after they have fallen.

### Approach
1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `pos`: A vector of vectors where each sub-vector contains two integers representing the left edge and the size of the square.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a vector `past` to keep track of the past squares and their dimensions.
   - Use a vector `ans` to store the maximum heights after each square falls.

3. **Processing Each Square**:
   - For each square described in `pos`, calculate the current square's boundaries and its initial height.
   - Use a helper function `search` to find the maximum height from the existing squares that overlap with the current square.

4. **Height Calculation**:
   - In the `search` function, check if the current square overlaps with any past squares. If it does, update the maximum height accordingly.
   - Add the current square to the `past` vector after calculating its final height.

### Code Walk-through
- The main function `fallingSquares` iterates through each square position and calculates the new height after falling.
- The helper function `search` checks for overlaps with previously fallen squares and determines the maximum height that the current square will reach based on those overlaps.
- Each time a new square is processed, its height is compared against the maximum height seen so far and stored in the result vector.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2), where N is the number of squares, due to the nested iteration to check overlaps with past squares.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the past squares.
