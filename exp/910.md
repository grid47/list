### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the minimum possible value of the range (the difference between the maximum and minimum values) of the array after each number in the array can be increased or decreased by \( k \).

### Class Definition
- **Class**: `Solution`
  - **Method**: `int smallestRangeII(vector<int>& nums, int k)`
    - Takes a vector of integers `nums` and an integer `k`.
    - Returns the minimum possible range after adjusting the numbers by \( k \).

### Approach
1. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the array `nums` to easily access the minimum and maximum values.
   - Define `n` as the size of the sorted array.

2. **Initial Range Calculation**:
   - Calculate the initial maximum (`nums[n - 1]`) and minimum (`nums[0]`) of the array, and set the initial result `res` to the difference `nums[n - 1] - nums[0]`.

3. **Iterate and Adjust**:
   - Iterate through the sorted array (up to the second-to-last element):
     - For each element `nums[i]`, calculate:
       - `maxi`: the maximum value after adding \( k \) to the current element or using the adjusted maximum value (considering \( k \) on the largest element).
       - `mini`: the minimum value after subtracting \( k \) from the next element or using the adjusted minimum value (considering \( k \) on the smallest element).
     - Update the result `res` by comparing the current minimum range with `maxi - mini`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the minimum range calculated.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), due to the sorting of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the space used for calculations is constant.
