### Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `p`, find all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. You may return the answer in any order.

### Approach
1. **Character Count Arrays**:
   - Use two arrays of size 26 to count the frequency of characters in `p` and the current window in `s`.

2. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Iterate through string `s` using a sliding window of size equal to the length of `p`.
   - Maintain the frequency count of characters in the current window.
   - Adjust the count as the window moves by removing the character that is left behind and adding the new character that enters the window.

3. **Comparison**:
   - After adjusting the character counts for the current window, compare the counts of `s` and `p`. If they match, it means the current window is an anagram of `p`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Count Initialization**:
   - Count the occurrences of each character in `p` using the `pc` array.
   
2. **Sliding Window Execution**:
   - Traverse through `s` with a for loop.
   - For each character in `s`, update the `sc` array:
     - Decrement the count of the character that is sliding out of the window.
     - Increment the count of the character that is sliding into the window.

3. **Anagram Check**:
   - If the character counts of `sc` and `pc` are equal, store the starting index of the anagram in the result vector.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the list of starting indices where anagrams of `p` are found in `s`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of string `s`. Each character is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the size of the character count arrays is constant (26).
