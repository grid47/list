### Problem Statement

The problem requires us to determine a way to fill in the missing rolls from a series of dice rolls while maintaining a specified average (mean). We are given an array of existing rolls, the desired mean value, and the number of missing rolls. Our task is to calculate the values of these missing rolls such that the final mean of all rolls matches the given mean. The constraints dictate that the values of the missing rolls can only be between 1 and 6 (inclusive), reflecting the faces of a standard six-sided die.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Required Sum**: First, we need to determine the total sum that all the rolls (including both the existing and missing ones) should equal to achieve the desired mean. This can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{total\_required\_sum} = \text{mean} \times (\text{number of existing rolls} + \text{number of missing rolls})
   \]

2. **Determine the Sum of Existing Rolls**: Next, we calculate the sum of the existing rolls, which we can easily obtain by iterating through the `rolls` array.

3. **Calculate the Required Sum for Missing Rolls**: The required sum for the missing rolls can be derived by subtracting the sum of existing rolls from the total required sum:
   \[
   \text{sum\_of\_missing\_rolls} = \text{total\_required\_sum} - \text{sum\_of\_existing\_rolls}
   \]

4. **Check Feasibility**: We need to ensure that it is possible to generate the required number of missing rolls with values between 1 and 6. Specifically:
   - The minimum possible sum of the missing rolls (if all rolls are 1) is equal to `n`.
   - The maximum possible sum of the missing rolls (if all rolls are 6) is equal to `6 * n`.

   If the calculated `sum_of_missing_rolls` is less than `n` or greater than `6 * n`, it is impossible to generate a valid configuration, and we should return an empty vector.

5. **Calculate Individual Values**: If the sum is feasible, we can determine the average value for each missing roll and any remainder that needs to be distributed:
   - The base value for each roll is obtained by integer division: `x = sum_of_missing_rolls / n`.
   - The remainder can be calculated with modulo: `rem = sum_of_missing_rolls % n`.

6. **Construct the Result**: We initialize a vector of size `n` with each element set to `x`, and then distribute the remainder across the first `rem` elements to ensure that they are slightly higher than `x`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here's a detailed explanation of the code implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> missingRolls(vector<int>& rolls, int mean, int n) {
```
- We define the `Solution` class and the `missingRolls` method, which takes an array of existing rolls, a target mean, and the number of missing rolls.

```cpp
        int m = rolls.size();
        
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            sum += rolls[i];
```
- We determine the size of the existing rolls array (`m`) and calculate the total sum of the existing rolls.

```cpp
        int net = mean * (m + n);
        sum = net - sum;
```
- We calculate the total required sum using the specified mean and the number of rolls (existing and missing). The new value of `sum` now represents the total that must be achieved by the missing rolls.

```cpp
        // create an array of size n with sum = sum and elements 1 - 6
        
        if(sum < n || sum > 6 * n) return vector<int>{};
```
- We check if the `sum` is feasible. If the sum is less than `n` (the minimum possible) or greater than `6 * n` (the maximum possible), we return an empty vector.

```cpp
        int x = sum / n, rem = sum % n;
        vector<int> res(n, x);
        
        for(int i = 0; i < rem; i++) {
            res[i]++;
        }
```
- If the sum is valid, we calculate the base value `x` and the remainder `rem`. We create a result vector initialized with `n` elements all set to `x`. We then increment the first `rem` elements to ensure they sum to the correct total.

```cpp
        return res;
    }
};
```
- Finally, we return the constructed result vector.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(m + n), where `m` is the number of existing rolls and `n` is the number of missing rolls. We iterate through the existing rolls once to compute their sum and create a new vector of size `n`.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n), as we create a new vector of size `n` to store the missing rolls.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the `missingRolls` method effectively determines the values of missing rolls required to achieve a desired mean for a series of dice rolls. The approach relies on straightforward calculations and conditions to ensure feasibility. By checking the necessary sum constraints and calculating the appropriate values for the missing rolls, we can derive a valid solution or determine that it is impossible. This implementation is both efficient and clear, making it suitable for handling a variety of input scenarios within the problem's constraints.
