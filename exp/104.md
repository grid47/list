### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth, defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Approach
1. Use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the binary tree.
2. For each node, calculate the depth of its left and right subtrees.
3. Return `1 + max(left depth, right depth)` to account for the current node in the depth calculation.
4. Base case: if the node is `NULL`, return 0.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 5**: Define the function `maxDepth`, which takes a pointer to the root node of the tree.
- **Line 6**: Check if the root node is `NULL`. If so, return a depth of 0.
- **Line 7**: If the root is not `NULL`, recursively calculate the depth of the left and right subtrees. Take the maximum of these depths and add 1 to account for the current node.
- **Line 8**: Return the computed maximum depth.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(H)\), where \(H\) is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack.
