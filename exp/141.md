### Problem Statement
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it. A cycle exists if a node's `next` pointer points to a previous node in the list.

### Approach
1. **Two Pointers**:
   - Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`.
   - The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1-5**: Define the `ListNode` structure for the linked list.
- **Line 6**: Define the `hasCycle` function:
  - **Line 7**: Initialize `slow` and `fast` pointers to the head of the list.
  - **Line 8**: Use a while loop that continues as long as `fast` and `fast->next` are not null:
    - **Line 9**: Move the `slow` pointer one step forward.
    - **Line 10**: Move the `fast` pointer two steps forward.
    - **Line 11**: If `slow` and `fast` meet at the same node, it indicates the presence of a cycle, and the function returns `true`.
  - **Line 12**: If the loop exits without finding a cycle, return `false`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the linked list, since each node is visited at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as no additional space is used (only two pointers are maintained).
