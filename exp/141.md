### Problem Statement

The problem asks you to determine whether a given singly linked list has a cycle. A cycle in a linked list occurs when a node's `next` pointer points to one of the previous nodes, forming a loop. The goal is to return `true` if the linked list has a cycle, and `false` if it does not.

For example:
- **Input**: `head = [3, 2, 0, -4]`, `pos = 1` (where `pos` indicates the node at which the cycle starts).
- **Output**: `true` (since the node at index 1 points back to itself, forming a cycle).
  
- **Input**: `head = [1, 2]`, `pos = -1`.
- **Output**: `false` (no cycle).

### Approach

To detect a cycle in a singly linked list, we can use the **Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm**, also known as the **Tortoise and Hare Algorithm**. This algorithm uses two pointers:
1. A **slow pointer** that moves one step at a time.
2. A **fast pointer** that moves two steps at a time.

The idea is that if a cycle exists, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer because the fast pointer will complete laps within the cycle and meet the slow pointer somewhere inside the loop. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Two pointers**: The slow and fast pointers are initialized at the head of the list.
2. **Traversal**: In each iteration, the slow pointer moves one step ahead, while the fast pointer moves two steps ahead.
3. **Cycle Detection**: If the slow pointer and the fast pointer meet at any point, it means a cycle exists, and we return `true`.
4. **End of List**: If the fast pointer or its `next` pointer reaches `NULL`, it indicates that the list has no cycle, and we return `false`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let’s break down the code step by step to understand how it works.

#### Step 1: Function Definition and Initial Pointers
```cpp
bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
    ListNode* slow = head, *fast = head;
```
- The function `hasCycle` takes a `ListNode` pointer `head` as input, which points to the head of the linked list.
- We initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the `head` of the list. The `slow` pointer will move one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer will move two steps at a time.

#### Step 2: Traversing the List
```cpp
while(fast && fast->next) {
    slow = slow->next;
    fast = fast->next->next;
```
- The `while` loop checks if `fast` and `fast->next` are non-null. This is important because if the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, it means there is no cycle (since the `fast` pointer would have no further nodes to traverse).
- Inside the loop:
  - The `slow` pointer moves one step ahead (`slow = slow->next`).
  - The `fast` pointer moves two steps ahead (`fast = fast->next->next`).

#### Step 3: Checking for a Cycle
```cpp
if(slow == fast) return true;
```
- After moving the pointers, we check if the `slow` pointer and the `fast` pointer are pointing to the same node. If they are, it means there is a cycle because the fast pointer has caught up with the slow pointer within the cycle.
- If a cycle is detected, we return `true`.

#### Step 4: End of the List
```cpp
return false;
```
- If the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list (`fast` or `fast->next` is null), we return `false` because a cycle cannot exist if the list has no further nodes.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: In the worst case, the fast pointer will traverse the list twice: once moving at two steps per iteration and then meeting the slow pointer. This means that the time complexity is linear with respect to the number of nodes in the list. The time complexity is therefore O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The algorithm uses only two pointers (`slow` and `fast`), and does not require any extra space proportional to the size of the input. Therefore, the space complexity is constant, O(1).

### Conclusion

The solution efficiently detects whether a singly linked list contains a cycle using Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm, also known as the **Tortoise and Hare** algorithm. This approach has several key advantages:
1. **Time Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in linear time, O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is optimal for cycle detection, as each node in the worst case is visited only once.
2. **Space Efficiency**: It uses constant space, O(1), by using only two pointers, regardless of the size of the list.
3. **Simplicity**: The approach is simple to implement and avoids the need for extra space such as a hash set or modifying the list structure.

#### Key Insights:
- **Fast and Slow Pointers**: The crux of this algorithm lies in the two-pointer approach, where one pointer moves at a faster pace than the other. This makes it possible to detect cycles by leveraging the fact that the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer if a cycle exists.
- **Optimal Solution**: This solution is optimal in terms of both time and space complexity for detecting cycles in a singly linked list.

In conclusion, this algorithm is widely used in problems related to cycle detection in linked lists and is an efficient solution for the given problem.
