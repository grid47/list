### Problem Statement
Given a character array `s`, reverse the array in-place.

### Approach
To reverse the string in-place, we can use a two-pointer technique:
1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: One pointer (`i`) starts at the beginning of the array, and the other pointer (`j`) starts at the end.
2. **Swap Characters**: While the first pointer is less than or equal to the second pointer:
   - Swap the characters at the two pointers.
   - Move the first pointer forward (`i++`) and the second pointer backward (`j--`).
3. The process continues until the pointers meet or cross each other.

### Code Walk-through
- The function accepts a vector of characters.
- The while loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`, performing swaps and adjusting pointers accordingly.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string. Each character is swapped once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \), as the reversal is done in-place and no additional space is used.
