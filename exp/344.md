### Problem Statement

The problem asks you to reverse a string, where the string is represented as a vector of characters. Your task is to implement a function that modifies the given vector in-place, such that the characters are reversed. The input string is mutable, and you should reverse it without using additional space for another string (except for a few auxiliary variables).

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can utilize a two-pointer technique. The idea is to have one pointer at the beginning of the string and the other at the end, and then swap the characters at these two positions. After each swap, we move the pointers inward towards each other until they meet in the middle.

This technique is efficient because:
1. **In-place reversal**: We don't need extra space to store the reversed string. We directly modify the input vector.
2. **Constant time swaps**: Swapping two characters is a constant-time operation, so the algorithm is efficient.

The key observation here is that reversing a string is simply a process of swapping characters from both ends and moving toward the center.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize Two Pointers
```cpp
int i = 0, j = s.size() - 1;
```
- We initialize two pointers: `i` at the beginning of the string (`0`), and `j` at the last character (`s.size() - 1`).
- These pointers will help us traverse the string from both ends.

#### Step 2: Start the Reversal Loop
```cpp
while (i <= j) {
    swap(s[i++], s[j--]);
}
```
- The `while` loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`. This ensures that the pointers meet in the middle, effectively reversing the string.
- Inside the loop, we swap the characters at positions `i` and `j` using the `swap` function. After the swap:
  - `i++` moves the `i` pointer to the right (toward the middle).
  - `j--` moves the `j` pointer to the left (also toward the middle).
- The loop continues swapping characters until the pointers cross each other.

#### Step 3: End of Function
Once the loop finishes, the string has been reversed in-place. The function doesn't need to return anything because the reversal happens directly on the input vector.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of characters in the input string.
- In the worst case, we swap each character exactly once. Since there are `n/2` swaps, the total number of operations is proportional to `n`.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are reversing the string in-place without using any extra space except for a few variables (`i`, `j`).

### Conclusion

This solution provides an efficient way to reverse a string in-place using the two-pointer technique. By iterating over the string only once and swapping characters in-place, the solution achieves an optimal time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. The space complexity is constant (**O(1)**), as no extra space is used aside from a few variables.

This approach is ideal for problems where space efficiency is critical, and the solution leverages the simplicity of swapping characters from both ends to meet in the middle. The algorithm is easy to implement, highly efficient, and works seamlessly for reversing strings in real-time without the need for additional memory allocation.
