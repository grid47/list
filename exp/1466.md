### Problem Statement

The goal of the problem is to determine the minimum number of roads that need to be reversed in order to ensure that all paths lead from a given starting city (city `0`) to all other cities in a directed graph. The input consists of an integer `n`, representing the number of cities, and a list of connections, where each connection represents a bidirectional road between two cities. The problem can be visualized as a graph traversal challenge, where we must count how many edges need to be reversed to create a path from the starting city to every other city.

### Approach

The solution involves a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the graph from the starting city. Here's the high-level overview of the approach:

1. **Graph Representation**: The cities and their connections are represented using an adjacency list (`grid`). Additionally, a mapping (`mp`) is used to keep track of which connections are directed (i.e., which way they need to be reversed).

2. **BFS Traversal**: A BFS algorithm is initiated from city `0`. As we traverse through the cities, we keep track of visited cities and count how many roads would need to be reversed to reach each city.

3. **Counting Reversals**: While traversing, whenever we reach a city through a directed road (as per our mapping), we increment the count of roads that need to be reversed.

4. **Result**: Finally, the count of reversed roads is returned, representing the minimum number of roads to reverse in order to connect all cities back to city `0`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the code:

1. **Class Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
   ```

   - The solution is encapsulated within a class named `Solution`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   int minReorder(int n, vector<vector<int>>& conn) {
   ```

   - The `minReorder` function takes an integer `n` (the number of cities) and a vector of vectors `conn` (the connections between cities) as inputs and returns the minimum number of roads to reverse.

3. **Graph Representation**:
   ```cpp
   vector<vector<int>> grid(n);
   map<int, map<int, bool>> mp;
   ```

   - An adjacency list `grid` is created with `n` empty vectors, where each vector will hold the connected cities. A nested map `mp` is also initialized to track the directed roads.

4. **Building the Graph**:
   ```cpp
   for(auto it: conn) {
       grid[it[0]].push_back(it[1]);
       grid[it[1]].push_back(it[0]);
       mp[it[0]][it[1]] = true;
   }
   ```

   - For each connection in `conn`, we update the adjacency list and populate the mapping to indicate that there is a direct road from `it[0]` to `it[1]`.

5. **BFS Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int cnt = 0;
   queue<int> q;
   q.push(0);
   vector<int> vis(n, 0);
   vis[0] = true;
   ```

   - A counter `cnt` is initialized to count the number of roads that need to be reversed. A queue `q` is initialized for BFS, starting with city `0`. A `vis` vector keeps track of visited cities.

6. **BFS Traversal**:
   ```cpp
   while(!q.empty()) {
       int sz = q.size();
       while(sz--) {
           int tmp = q.front();
           q.pop();
           for(int it: grid[tmp]) {
               if(vis[it]) continue;
               vis[it] = true;
               if(mp.count(tmp) && mp[tmp].count(it)) cnt++;
               q.push(it);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   - The outer while loop continues until there are no more cities to explore. The inner while loop processes each city in the queue:
     - Each connected city is checked to see if it has already been visited.
     - If it has not been visited, it is marked as visited.
     - If there is a direct road leading to it (as per the `mp` mapping), the count of roads to reverse is incremented.
     - The city is then added to the queue for further exploration.

7. **Returning the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return cnt;
   ```

   - The function returns the count of roads that need to be reversed to ensure all paths lead back to city `0`.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n + e)\), where \(n\) is the number of cities and \(e\) is the number of roads (or connections). This is due to the BFS traversal through the graph.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n + e)\) as well, due to the storage of the graph in the adjacency list and the visited vector.

### Conclusion

The presented solution efficiently determines the minimum number of road reversals needed to ensure that all paths lead back to the starting city using a breadth-first search strategy. Key aspects of the solution include:

1. **Graph Traversal**: The use of BFS allows for efficient exploration of all connected cities from the starting point.

2. **Directed Connection Tracking**: By maintaining a mapping of connections, the solution effectively counts the necessary reversals, ensuring correctness.

3. **Clarity and Structure**: The structured approach of separating graph construction, traversal, and counting enhances the readability and maintainability of the code.

Overall, this solution demonstrates effective use of graph theory concepts and algorithmic design to solve a practical problem, making it a valuable reference for similar challenges in competitive programming and algorithm studies.
