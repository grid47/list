### 🌟 Problem Statement

The task is to calculate the **bitwise AND** of all numbers in the range from `left` to `right`, inclusive. For two given integers, `left` and `right`, we need to compute the bitwise AND of all numbers between them.

For example:
- **Input:** `left = 5`, `right = 7`
- **Output:** `4`

**Explanation:**
- The numbers in the range 5 to 7 are: `5, 6, 7`.
- The bitwise AND of these numbers is: `5 & 6 & 7 = 4`.

### 🔍 Approach

To understand how to approach this problem, let’s first understand what **bitwise AND** means. The **bitwise AND** of a set of numbers results in a number where each bit is `1` only if the corresponding bits of all input numbers are also `1`. 

In this case, directly calculating the bitwise AND for a large range of numbers could be inefficient. So, we need to come up with an optimized solution!

### Key Insight 💡
The result of the bitwise AND of all numbers between `left` and `right` only depends on the **common prefix** of their binary representations. If we keep shifting both numbers to the right, the differing bits will eventually disappear, and we’ll be left with the common part of the two numbers.

By shifting both numbers until they’re equal, we can calculate the result efficiently.

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Let’s break down how we can implement this idea in code:

#### Step 1: Initialize the Shift Counter
```cpp
int shift = 0;
```
- We start with a variable `shift` initialized to 0. This will track how many times we need to shift `left` and `right` to the right until they become equal.

#### Step 2: Right Shift Until `left` and `right` are Equal
```cpp
while(right != left)
{
    right >>= 1;
    left >>= 1;
    shift++;
}
```
- This `while` loop continues until `left` and `right` are the same.
- In each loop iteration, both numbers are right-shifted by one. This is like dividing them by 2 and moving their binary representation to the right.
- We increase the `shift` counter as we make these shifts.
- Once the loop ends, `left` and `right` will be equal, which means they now share a common prefix in their binary form.

#### Step 3: Shift Back to the Left
```cpp
return right << shift;
```
- After the loop, both `left` and `right` are equal, and we simply shift `right` back to the left by the number of shifts we counted. This restores the common binary prefix to its original position.
- The result of this operation will be the bitwise AND of all numbers between `left` and `right`.

### 📊 Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(log(max(left, right))):** The `while` loop runs while `left` and `right` are not equal, and in each iteration, we halve both `left` and `right` (right-shifting). The number of iterations is proportional to the number of bits in the larger of the two numbers, which is around `log(x)`, where `x` is the larger number.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** We use only a constant amount of extra space to store `shift`, `left`, and `right`. No additional data structures are required, so the space complexity is constant.

### 🎯 Conclusion

This solution leverages the power of **bitwise operations** to efficiently calculate the bitwise AND of all integers in the given range. By focusing on the **common binary prefix** of `left` and `right`, we avoid iterating over each number in the range, making the approach highly efficient.

#### Key Takeaways:
1. **Efficiency:** The algorithm runs in O(log(max(left, right))) time, making it ideal for large ranges.
2. **Space Optimization:** With O(1) space complexity, it’s great for memory-constrained environments.
3. **Bitwise Magic:** By using right and left shifts, we harness low-level operations to get an optimal solution.

This approach is perfect for large input sizes where iterating through each number would be too slow. With a bit of clever thinking, you’ve got a solution that’s both **simple** and **efficient**. Keep it up! 🙌
