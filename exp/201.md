### Problem Statement
Given two integers `left` and `right`, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range `[left, right]`.

### Approach
1. **Finding the Common Prefix**:
   - The bitwise AND of a range of numbers can be derived from their common prefix.
   - The key observation is that any differing bits between `left` and `right` will contribute `0` to the result.

2. **Right Shift**:
   - Continuously right shift both `left` and `right` until they are equal. This process effectively discards the differing least significant bits.
   - Count the number of shifts performed, which indicates how many bits will be `0` in the final result.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After the loop, shift the `right` value back to the left by the number of shifts to restore the common prefix.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the class `Solution`.
- **Line 2**: Define the `rangeBitwiseAnd` function that takes two integers, `left` and `right`.
- **Line 3**: Initialize a variable `shift` to count the number of right shifts.
- **Lines 5-9**: 
  - While `left` is not equal to `right`, right shift both numbers and increment the `shift` counter.
- **Line 11**: Return the value of `right` left-shifted by `shift`, which represents the result of the bitwise AND for the range.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\log(\text{max}(left, right)))\) because the number of shifts is proportional to the number of bits in the larger number.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
