### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to compute the **bitwise AND** of all the numbers in the range from `left` to `right`, inclusive. Given two integers `left` and `right`, we are to calculate the bitwise AND of all integers between these two values.

For example:
- **Input:** `left = 5`, `right = 7`
- **Output:** `4`
  
Explanation:
- The numbers from 5 to 7 are: `5, 6, 7`. 
- The bitwise AND of these numbers: `5 & 6 & 7 = 4`.

### Approach

The **bitwise AND** operation between a group of numbers results in a number where each bit is set to `1` only if all corresponding bits of the input numbers are `1`. To compute the result of the **bitwise AND** over a large range, a direct approach could involve iterating through every number in the range, which would be inefficient for large values of `left` and `right`.

However, we can optimize this approach based on the following observations:
1. **Identifying Common Prefix:** The bitwise AND of all numbers between `left` and `right` depends only on the **common prefix** of the binary representations of `left` and `right`. As we shift both numbers to the right, their common prefix remains intact, while the varying bits will eventually disappear as `left` and `right` become equal.
2. **Bitwise Shifting:** As we continue to shift `left` and `right` to the right (by dividing them by 2), they will eventually become equal when the non-matching bits are discarded. The number of shifts required to make `left` and `right` equal corresponds to the position where the bits stop differing. This gives us the result when we shift the final value of `right` back to its original position.

Thus, the key idea is to keep shifting `left` and `right` to the right until they are equal, counting the number of shifts, and then shifting `right` back to its original position. This approach avoids the need to iterate through every number in the range, making it much more efficient.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize the Shift Counter
```cpp
int shift = 0;
```
- A variable `shift` is initialized to 0. This will track how many times we need to shift the numbers `left` and `right` to the right until they become equal.

#### Step 2: Right Shift Until `left` and `right` are Equal
```cpp
while(right != left)
{
    right >>= 1;
    left >>= 1;
    shift++;
}
```
- The `while` loop continues as long as `left` and `right` are not equal.
- In each iteration of the loop, both `right` and `left` are right-shifted by 1. Right shifting a number by 1 bit is equivalent to dividing it by 2.
- The shift counter (`shift`) is incremented after each iteration, as we are effectively moving both numbers to the right.
- Once the loop ends, `left` and `right` will be equal, meaning they now share the same common prefix in their binary representation.

#### Step 3: Shift Back to the Left
```cpp
return right << shift;
```
- Once `left` and `right` are equal, we need to shift `right` back to the left by the number of shifts counted in `shift`. This restores the common prefix to its original position.
- The result of this operation is the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range from `left` to `right`, as all bits after the common prefix are `0` in the result.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(log(max(left, right))):** The while loop runs while `left` and `right` are not equal, and in each iteration, both `left` and `right` are halved (right-shifted). The number of iterations required to make `left` and `right` equal is proportional to the number of bits in the larger of the two numbers. Since the number of bits in a number `x` is approximately `log(x)`, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(max(left, right))).

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space for the variables `shift`, `left`, and `right`. There are no additional data structures used, so the space complexity is O(1).

### Conclusion

The provided solution efficiently calculates the bitwise AND of all integers in the range from `left` to `right` using bitwise operations. By focusing on the common prefix of the binary representations of `left` and `right`, we avoid the need to iterate over each number in the range, which would be inefficient for large ranges.

Key points:
1. **Efficiency:** The approach runs in O(log(max(left, right))) time, which is very efficient for large values of `left` and `right`.
2. **Space Optimization:** The space complexity is O(1), making it suitable for environments with limited memory.
3. **Bitwise Operations:** By leveraging bitwise operations (right-shifting and left-shifting), the algorithm takes advantage of low-level optimizations, making it both time and space efficient.

This solution is ideal for scenarios where the range between `left` and `right` is large, as it avoids the need for costly iteration through each number in the range. The algorithm's simplicity and elegance make it a great choice for solving the **bitwise AND** problem in an optimal way.
