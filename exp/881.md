### Problem Statement
You are given an array `people` where each element represents the weight of a person, and an integer `limit` representing the weight limit of a boat. Each boat can carry at most two people. Your task is to determine the minimum number of boats required to rescue all the people.

### Approach
The solution uses a greedy two-pointer technique:

1. **Sorting**: First, sort the `people` array to facilitate pairing the lightest and heaviest individuals.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use two pointers, `lo` (starting from the lightest person) and `hi` (starting from the heaviest person):
   - If the sum of the weights of the people at these two pointers is less than or equal to the `limit`, it means both can share a boat. In this case, increment the `lo` pointer and decrement the `hi` pointer.
   - If they cannot share a boat, only decrement the `hi` pointer (the heavier person goes alone).
   - Regardless of whether one or two people are placed in a boat, increment the `boats` counter.

3. **Termination**: Continue this process until all people have been assigned to boats.

### Code Walk-through
- Sort the array of weights.
- Initialize pointers and the `boats` counter.
- Iterate while `lo` is less than or equal to `hi`, checking if the current lightest and heaviest can share a boat or not, and update the counters accordingly.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n \log n) \), where \( n \) is the number of people, due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \), as no additional space proportional to the input size is used.
