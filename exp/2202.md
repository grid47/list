### Problem Statement

The task is to find the maximum element from a given array `nums` of integers after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation consists of removing the top element from the array, but the top element can either be discarded or pushed back into the array. The objective is to determine the maximum element that can be obtained after performing these operations under the constraint of exactly `k` operations.

Given:
- An array `nums` of integers.
- An integer `k` representing the number of operations to perform.

We are to return the maximum value achievable after performing exactly `k` operations.

### Approach

To solve this problem, the algorithm needs to account for several edge cases and strategically choose how to handle the array after performing up to `k` operations. The approach is broken down as follows:

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `k == 0`, no operations can be performed, and thus the maximum element is the first element of the array (if the array is non-empty).
   - If `k == 1`, only one operation can be performed, so if there's only one element, the answer is `-1` (since the only element is discarded).
   - If the array contains only one element and `k` is odd, the element is discarded, and the result is `-1`. If `k` is even, the single element remains intact.

2. **When `k > 1`**:
   - If `k` is less than or equal to the length of the array, we can look at the first `k-1` elements to determine the maximum value that can remain after some operations. Specifically, we consider removing and potentially returning the first `k-1` elements, and the maximum element among those should be the result.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, we can consider the possibility of also including the element at index `k` (if the array is long enough).

3. **Efficient Maximum Calculation**:
   - To find the maximum efficiently, we can compute the maximum of the first `k-1` elements, and if `k` is smaller than the length of the array, also compare the element at index `k` itself.

4. **Optimization**:
   - The algorithm avoids unnecessary iterations by limiting the scope of the array elements to be considered, thereby ensuring that the solution is efficient even for larger input sizes.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
int maximumTop(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int ans = 0;  // Initialize the answer variable.
    int n = nums.size();  // Get the size of the nums array.

    // Edge case 1: If no operations are performed.
    if (k == 0) return (n >= 1) ? nums[0] : -1;

    // Edge case 2: If only one operation can be performed.
    if (k == 1) return (n == 1) ? -1 : nums[1];

    // Edge case 3: If the array contains only one element.
    if (n == 1) return (k % 2 == 1) ? -1 : nums[0];

    // Case when we have more than one element and k > 1
    int mx = *max_element(begin(nums), begin(nums) + min(n, k - 1));
    
    // If there are more elements and the array's length is greater than k, consider nums[k].
    if (k < n) mx = max(mx, nums[k]);
    
    return mx;
}
```

**Step 1: Initialize Answer and Array Size**
```cpp
int ans = 0;
int n = nums.size();
```
- `ans` will store the maximum value that can be obtained after performing `k` operations.
- `n` stores the size of the `nums` array.

**Step 2: Handle Special Cases**
- **Case when `k == 0`**:
```cpp
if (k == 0) return (n >= 1) ? nums[0] : -1;
```
If no operations can be performed (`k == 0`), simply return the first element of the array (if the array is non-empty). If the array is empty, return `-1`.

- **Case when `k == 1`**:
```cpp
if (k == 1) return (n == 1) ? -1 : nums[1];
```
If exactly one operation is allowed, then we discard the first element and return the second element, unless the array only contains one element, in which case the answer is `-1`.

- **Case when `n == 1`**:
```cpp
if (n == 1) return (k % 2 == 1) ? -1 : nums[0];
```
If there is only one element, the behavior depends on whether `k` is odd or even. If `k` is odd, the single element is discarded; if `k` is even, the single element remains.

**Step 3: Case for General Scenarios (k > 1)**
```cpp
int mx = *max_element(begin(nums), begin(nums) + min(n, k - 1));
```
- For the general case where `k > 1`, find the maximum value from the first `k-1` elements of the array. We use `min(n, k-1)` to ensure that we do not go beyond the bounds of the array.

**Step 4: Handle Case when `k` Exceeds Array Length**
```cpp
if (k < n) mx = max(mx, nums[k]);
```
- If `k` is less than the size of the array, we need to consider the element at index `k` since it could still be part of the result.

**Step 5: Return the Maximum**
```cpp
return mx;
```
- Finally, return the maximum value obtained after performing up to `k` operations.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(k)** for calculating the maximum over the first `k-1` elements using `max_element`.
- The final solution thus runs in **O(k)** time, which is optimal for this problem.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**, as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space (excluding the input).

### Conclusion

The algorithm efficiently solves the problem of finding the maximum element obtainable after performing exactly `k` operations on the array. It handles edge cases such as no operations, a single element in the array, and scenarios where `k` is larger than the array's length. The solution ensures optimal performance with a time complexity of **O(k)** and space complexity of **O(1)**, making it suitable for large inputs.

This approach can be useful for problems that involve selecting elements based on specific operations or constraints and demonstrates the importance of handling edge cases correctly.
