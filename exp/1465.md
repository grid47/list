### Problem Statement

The task is to find the maximum area of a rectangle that can be formed in a grid defined by its height \( h \) and width \( w \). This rectangle is constrained by vertical and horizontal cuts, represented by two arrays: `hr` (horizontal cuts) and `vt` (vertical cuts). The objective is to calculate the maximum possible area of a rectangle formed between these cuts, considering that cuts can be made at specific heights and widths.

### Approach

To determine the maximum area, we can break down the solution into a few key steps:

1. **Sorting Cuts**: First, we sort both the horizontal and vertical cuts. This will help in easily calculating the distances between successive cuts.

2. **Calculating Maximum Heights**:
   - After sorting, the maximum height available between cuts is found by considering the gaps between successive horizontal cuts as well as the gaps from the last cut to the height of the grid.

3. **Calculating Maximum Widths**:
   - Similarly, for vertical cuts, we calculate the maximum width by evaluating the gaps between vertical cuts and from the last cut to the width of the grid.

4. **Computing the Maximum Area**: Finally, the area of the rectangle is computed by multiplying the maximum height and maximum width. The result is then returned modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to avoid overflow.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the provided code:

1. **Class Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
   ```

   - The solution is encapsulated within a class named `Solution`, which is standard in competitive programming contexts.

2. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   int maxArea(int h, int w, vector<int>& hr, vector<int>& vt) {
   ```

   - The `maxArea` function takes the height `h`, width `w`, and two vectors `hr` and `vt` representing the horizontal and vertical cuts, respectively. It returns the maximum area as an integer.

3. **Variable Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int mx1 = 0, mx2 = 0;
   ```

   - Two variables `mx1` and `mx2` are initialized to hold the maximum height and width, respectively.

4. **Sorting Cuts**:
   ```cpp
   sort(hr.begin(), hr.end());
   sort(vt.begin(), vt.end());
   ```

   - Both the horizontal and vertical cuts are sorted in ascending order. This is crucial for calculating the gaps between the cuts.

5. **Calculating Maximum Height**:
   ```cpp
   mx1 = h - hr.back();
   ```

   - Initially, `mx1` is set to the height of the grid minus the last horizontal cut. This represents the area above the highest cut.

   ```cpp
   int prv = 0;
   for(int i = 0; i < hr.size(); i++) {
       mx1 = max(mx1, hr[i] - prv);
       prv = hr[i];
   }
   ```

   - A loop iterates through the sorted horizontal cuts. For each cut, the gap between the current cut and the previous one is calculated, and `mx1` is updated if this gap is larger than the previously recorded maximum height.

6. **Calculating Maximum Width**:
   ```cpp
   prv = 0;
   for(int i = 0; i < vt.size(); i++) {
       mx2 = max(mx2, vt[i] - prv);
       prv = vt[i];
   }
   ```

   - A similar approach is used for vertical cuts. The maximum width is computed by iterating through the sorted vertical cuts, recording the gaps between them, and updating `mx2` accordingly.

7. **Computing the Maximum Area**:
   ```cpp
   long long mxa = mx1, mxb = mx2;
   return (mxa * mxb) % 1000000007;
   ```

   - The maximum height and width are converted to `long long` to prevent overflow during multiplication. The area is then calculated as \( mxa \times mxb \) and returned modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \(O(n \log n + m \log m)\), where \(n\) is the number of horizontal cuts and \(m\) is the number of vertical cuts. This accounts for the sorting of the cuts and the linear traversal to calculate the maximum height and width.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as the algorithm uses a fixed amount of additional space for variables and does not require any extra data structures that grow with the input size.

### Conclusion

This solution effectively computes the maximum area of a rectangle formed between specified cuts in a grid. The approach combines sorting and linear traversal, which are efficient strategies for this problem. 

Key takeaways from the implementation include:

1. **Efficiency**: The use of sorting and direct calculations ensures the solution is efficient, making it suitable for larger inputs.

2. **Modular Arithmetic**: The area calculation includes a modulus operation to handle large numbers and prevent overflow, which is important in competitive programming.

3. **Clarity**: The step-by-step logical progression from sorting to area calculation makes the algorithm easy to follow and understand.

Overall, this approach demonstrates effective use of basic data structures and algorithms to solve a geometrical problem efficiently.
