### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest product and return that product.

### Approach
1. **Tracking Maximum and Minimum Products**:
   - Use two variables `mx` and `mn` to keep track of the maximum and minimum products at each position. The minimum is needed because a negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product when multiplied.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - For each element in `nums`:
     - If the current number is negative, swap `mx` and `mn`.
     - Update `mx` to be the maximum of the current number or the product of `mx` and the current number.
     - Update `mn` to be the minimum of the current number or the product of `mn` and the current number.
     - Update `res` to keep track of the maximum product found so far.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return the maximum product found after processing all elements.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the `maxProduct` function, accepting a vector of integers as input.
- **Line 2**: Initialize `mx` and `mn` to 1, and `res` to the smallest possible integer.
- **Line 3-12**: Iterate over each number in `nums`:
  - **Line 4**: If the number is negative, swap `mx` and `mn` to handle the effect of multiplication.
  - **Line 5-6**: Update `mx` and `mn` based on the current number.
  - **Line 8**: Update `res` to be the maximum of itself and `mx`.
- **Line 13**: Return `res`, which contains the maximum product.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in `nums`, since each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) as only a fixed amount of extra space is used regardless of the input size.
