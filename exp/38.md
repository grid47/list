### Problem Statement
The "Count and Say" sequence is a sequence of integers where each term is derived from the previous term. The first term is "1". To generate the next term, read the digits of the current term, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit. For example:
- The term "1" is read as "one 1" or "11".
- The term "11" is read as "two 1s" or "21".
- The term "21" is read as "one 2, then one 1" or "1211".

The task is to generate the \(n^{th}\) term of this sequence.

### Approach
1. **Base Case**: If \(n\) is 1, return "1" since that's the first term.
2. **Recursion**: For other values of \(n\), recursively call the function to get the \((n-1)^{th}\) term.
3. **Count and Say Logic**:
   - Initialize an empty string `ans` to construct the result.
   - Traverse the previous term `tmp`:
     - Count consecutive characters (digits) and store their counts.
     - Append the count and the digit to `ans`.
4. **Return the Result**: After constructing the \(n^{th}\) term, return `ans`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Base Case Check**: If \(n\) is 1, return "1".
2. **Recursive Call**: Call `countAndSay(n-1)` to get the previous term.
3. **Counting Logic**:
   - Use a loop to traverse `tmp`, counting occurrences of each digit.
   - For each unique digit, append the count and the digit to `ans`.
4. **Return Value**: After processing all digits, return `ans`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(2^n)\) in the worst case due to the recursive calls and string manipulations for larger \(n\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the recursion stack and storing the result strings.
