### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to determine the maximum network rank among all pairs of cities in a given network of roads. Each city can be represented as a node, and each road connecting two cities can be represented as an undirected edge between two nodes. The network rank for a pair of cities \( A \) and \( B \) is defined as the total number of roads connected to either city, minus one if there is a direct road between them. The task is to find the maximum network rank among all possible pairs of distinct cities.

### Approach

The solution involves the following steps:

1. **Data Structures**: We will use an array to count the number of roads connected to each city, and a map (or unordered set) to keep track of direct connections between cities.
2. **Building Connections**: We will iterate through the list of roads to populate our data structures, updating the counts and the direct connections.
3. **Calculating Maximum Rank**: Finally, we will compute the network rank for each pair of cities, applying the defined conditions to ensure we do not double count direct roads.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Letâ€™s break down the provided code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximalNetworkRank(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
```
- This defines the `Solution` class and a public method `maximalNetworkRank` which takes the number of cities \( n \) and a vector of roads as input.

```cpp
        vector<int> inward(n, 0);
        map<int, set<int>> mp;
```
- We declare a vector `inward` of size \( n \) initialized to zero, which will keep track of the number of roads connected to each city.
- A map `mp` is used to store the connections, where each city points to a set of connected cities. Using a set helps ensure that each connection is unique.

```cpp
        for(auto it: roads) {
            inward[it[0]]++;
            inward[it[1]]++;
            mp[it[0]].insert(it[1]);
            mp[it[1]].insert(it[0]);
        }
```
- This loop processes each road in the `roads` vector:
  - For each road connecting cities `it[0]` and `it[1]`, we increment the count for both cities in the `inward` vector.
  - We also add the connection to the map `mp` to keep track of direct connections.

```cpp
        int mx = 0;
```
- A variable `mx` is initialized to zero, which will eventually hold the maximum network rank found.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if(i == j) continue;
```
- Two nested loops iterate over all pairs of cities \( (i, j) \). The condition `if(i == j)` ensures that we only consider distinct pairs.

```cpp
                mx = max(mx, inward[i] + inward[j] - (mp.count(i) && mp[i].count(j)? 1: 0));
            }
        }
```
- For each pair of cities \( (i, j) \), we calculate the network rank:
  - The sum of roads connected to both cities is `inward[i] + inward[j]`.
  - If there is a direct road between them, we subtract 1 from this sum using the expression `(mp.count(i) && mp[i].count(j) ? 1 : 0)`.
  - We update `mx` to store the maximum value encountered.

```cpp
        return mx;
    }
};
```
- Finally, the maximum network rank is returned.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \( O(n^2) \) due to the nested loops that check every pair of cities. The preprocessing step where roads are counted is \( O(m) \), where \( m \) is the number of roads. Therefore, the overall time complexity can be approximated to \( O(n^2 + m) \).
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \( O(n + m) \) due to the `inward` vector and the map `mp`, which stores connections for each city.

### Conclusion

The provided solution efficiently calculates the maximum network rank among pairs of cities in a given network of roads by leveraging a combination of array and map data structures. By processing the roads to build counts and direct connections, the solution ensures accurate and quick computation of the required network ranks.

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **Data Structures**: Using vectors and maps enables efficient counting and lookup of connections.
2. **Efficiency**: The nested loop approach is straightforward but can be costly for large \( n \). However, it simplifies the calculation of network ranks without unnecessary complexity.
3. **Application**: This problem exemplifies how graph theory concepts can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as urban planning or network design, where connections and accessibility are crucial.

This algorithm can be particularly useful in scenarios involving urban networks, road connectivity, and other applications where understanding the relationships between entities is important.
