### Problem Statement
You are given an array `answers`, where each element represents the number of rabbits that have the same color as a particular rabbit, and the value indicates how many other rabbits of that color are present. The task is to determine the minimum number of rabbits that could be present based on the answers provided.

### Approach
1. **Counting Responses**:
   - Use an unordered map to count how many times each answer appears. This gives insight into how many rabbits reported the same color.

2. **Calculating Minimum Rabbits**:
   - For each unique answer, calculate the minimum number of rabbits that must exist:
     - If `i.first` is the answer (indicating that the rabbit says there are `i.first` other rabbits of the same color), then:
       - The total number of rabbits for that color would be the ceiling of the number of responses divided by the group size (i.e., `i.first + 1`), multiplied by the group size.

3. **Summing Up**:
   - Accumulate the results from all unique answers to get the total minimum number of rabbits.

### Code Walk-through
- **Methods**:
  - `int numRabbits(vector<int>& answers)`: The main function that processes the input `answers` to compute the minimum number of rabbits.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `answers` array, since we traverse the array and the map of counts.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of unique answers stored in the map.
