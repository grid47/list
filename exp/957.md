### Problem Statement
Given an array representing the state of prison cells, where each cell can either be occupied (1) or unoccupied (0), the goal is to determine the state of the cells after `n` days. The state of a cell on the next day is determined by its neighboring cells: a cell becomes occupied if both neighboring cells are occupied or both are unoccupied.

### Approach
1. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The function uses a set to track previously seen configurations of the cells to identify cycles in the state transitions.
   - By storing each state, the algorithm can determine when the states begin to repeat, which allows it to skip redundant calculations.

2. **State Transition**:
   - The state of the cells is updated daily by applying the rules defined for the next day's state using the `getNext` helper function.
   - If a previously seen state is encountered, the algorithm computes how many days remain and applies the transitions for the remaining days using modulo arithmetic.

3. **Helper Function**:
   - The `getNext` function calculates the state of the cells for the next day based on the current state, following the specified rules.

### Code Walk-through
- The main function initializes a set to store seen states and iterates through the number of days.
- If a new state is generated, it updates the current state; if a state repeats, it uses the modulo of the remaining days to determine the final state after `n` days.
- The final state of the cells is returned.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of days until a repeated state is detected, and transitions are computed accordingly.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the states in the set to detect cycles.
