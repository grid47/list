### Problem Statement
The task is to implement a wildcard matching function that determines if a given string `s` matches a pattern `p` which may contain wildcard characters:
- `?` matches any single character.
- `*` matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Initialization**:
   - Create a memoization table `memo` to store results of subproblems.
   - Use two indices `i` and `j` to track positions in the strings `s` and `p`, respectively.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If both `i` and `j` reach the end of their respective strings, return true (full match).
   - If only `j` reaches the end but `i` does not, return false (remaining characters in `s`).

3. **Memoization Check**:
   - If the result for the current indices `i` and `j` is already computed, return that result.

4. **Recursive Matching Logic**:
   - If characters match (i.e., `s[i] == p[j]`), proceed to the next characters in both strings.
   - If `p[j]` is a `?`, move to the next character in both strings, treating `?` as a match.
   - If `p[j]` is a `*`, two scenarios are possible:
     - Treat `*` as matching one or more characters (advance `i`).
     - Treat `*` as matching zero characters (advance `j`).

5. **Store Result**:
   - Save the computed result in the `memo` table to avoid redundant calculations.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Class Definition and Member Variables**:
   - The `Solution` class contains the input strings `s` and `p`, and a memoization table `memo`.

2. **DP Function**:
   - The `dp` function implements the recursive logic for matching `s` and `p` using the indices `i` and `j`.

3. **isMatch Function**:
   - The main function that initializes the variables and calls the `dp` function starting from the beginning of both strings.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the length of `s` and \(n\) is the length of `p`, due to the nested calls for each character.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) for the memoization table that stores results of subproblems.
