### Problem Statement

The given problem requires solving a sequence of numbers, where we need to repeatedly process the array to reduce it to a single element. Specifically, for every adjacent pair of numbers in the array, you compute the minimum for even indices and the maximum for odd indices. After this step, the array is halved, and the process is repeated until one number remains.

Given an array of integers, the objective is to repeatedly apply this transformation until we are left with a single value, which is the result.

### Approach

The approach is recursive and works by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. **Base Case**: 
   - When the length of the input array is 1, we simply return the only element, as no further processing is needed.

2. **Transform the Array**:
   - For each pair of adjacent elements in the array:
     - At even indices, take the minimum of the two adjacent elements.
     - At odd indices, take the maximum of the two adjacent elements.
   - This transformation reduces the size of the array by half after each step.

3. **Recursive Call**:
   - After transforming the array, we make a recursive call on the new, reduced array. This process repeats until the array size becomes 1, at which point the last remaining element is the answer.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The final result is the number left after repeated transformations.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

The following code implements the approach outlined above:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMaxGame(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size(); 
        if (n == 1) return nums[0];  // Base case: if only one element is left, return it

        vector<int> newNum(n / 2); // Array to hold the transformed values

        // Process the array in pairs
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) { 
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                // For even indices, take the minimum of the adjacent pair
                newNum[i] = min(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]); 
            } else {
                // For odd indices, take the maximum of the adjacent pair
                newNum[i] = max(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]); 
            }
        }

        // Recursively call the function on the reduced array
        return minMaxGame(newNum);
    }
};
```

#### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Base Case**:
   - The function first checks if the size of the array `nums` is 1. If so, it directly returns the single element, since no further operations are needed. This is the base case of the recursion.

   ```cpp
   if (n == 1) return nums[0];
   ```

2. **Creating a New Array**:
   - The array `newNum` is created, which will hold the transformed values. The size of `newNum` is half the size of the original array (`n / 2`), as the number of elements will reduce after one transformation step.

   ```cpp
   vector<int> newNum(n / 2);
   ```

3. **Transforming the Array**:
   - The loop runs through the original array in steps of 2. For each index `i`, it processes a pair of adjacent elements:
     - If `i` is even, the minimum of the two adjacent numbers is stored at index `i` in `newNum`.
     - If `i` is odd, the maximum of the two adjacent numbers is stored at index `i` in `newNum`.

   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) { 
       if (i % 2 == 0) {
           newNum[i] = min(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]);
       } else {
           newNum[i] = max(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]);
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Recursive Call**:
   - After transforming the array, the function calls itself recursively on the newly formed array `newNum` to repeat the transformation. This continues until the array size becomes 1.

   ```cpp
   return minMaxGame(newNum);
   ```

5. **Returning the Final Result**:
   - The recursion will continue reducing the array size until it reaches the base case where only one element is left, and that element is returned as the result.

### Example Walkthrough

Letâ€™s walk through the algorithm with an example to clarify how it works:

#### Example 1:
Input: 
```cpp
vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 7, 6, 8};
```
Steps:

1. The first call processes the array of size 8:
   - For `i = 0`: `min(1, 3) = 1`
   - For `i = 1`: `max(2, 4) = 4`
   - For `i = 2`: `min(5, 7) = 5`
   - For `i = 3`: `max(6, 8) = 8`
   - So, the new array becomes `[1, 4, 5, 8]`.

2. The second call processes the array of size 4:
   - For `i = 0`: `min(1, 4) = 1`
   - For `i = 1`: `max(5, 8) = 8`
   - The new array becomes `[1, 8]`.

3. The third call processes the array of size 2:
   - For `i = 0`: `min(1, 8) = 1`
   - The new array becomes `[1]`.

4. The base case is reached, and the function returns `1`.

Final Result: `1`

#### Example 2:
Input: 
```cpp
vector<int> nums = {4, 7, 9, 10};
```
Steps:

1. The first call processes the array of size 4:
   - For `i = 0`: `min(4, 7) = 4`
   - For `i = 1`: `max(9, 10) = 10`
   - The new array becomes `[4, 10]`.

2. The second call processes the array of size 2:
   - For `i = 0`: `min(4, 10) = 4`
   - The new array becomes `[4]`.

3. The base case is reached, and the function returns `4`.

Final Result: `4`

### Time Complexity

Let `n` be the size of the input array.

1. Each recursive call reduces the size of the array by half.
2. At each level, the algorithm processes every element once, which takes `O(n)` time.
3. The number of recursive calls is logarithmic, i.e., `O(log n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is determined by the storage required for the recursive calls and the new array at each step.

- In each recursive call, a new array of size `n / 2` is created. The maximum depth of the recursion is `log n`.
- Thus, the space complexity is **O(n)** due to the space used for the recursive call stack and the array at each level.

### Conclusion

The provided solution implements a recursive approach to reduce the given array by applying a sequence of transformations. The algorithm effectively handles arrays of any size, repeatedly applying the transformation until a single element remains. With a time complexity of **O(n)** and space complexity of **O(n)**, this solution is efficient and scalable for large arrays.
