### Problem Statement
The objective is to compute the sum of distances from each node to all other nodes in a tree. Given the number of nodes `n` and a list of edges that define the tree structure, the solution must efficiently calculate the sum of distances for each node.

### Approach
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the tree, where each node points to its connected nodes.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - **First DFS (`dfs1`)**:
     - Traverse the tree to calculate the count of nodes in the subtree rooted at each node and the total distance sum for the subtree.
     - For each node, accumulate the count of nodes from its children and compute the distance contribution from each child to the parent.
   - **Second DFS (`dfs2`)**:
     - Adjust the distance sums for each node based on the parent's distance sum. 
     - This is done by transferring the distance contribution from the parent to the child, while accounting for the number of nodes in the entire tree.

### Code Walk-through
- **Graph Construction**: Create the adjacency list using the provided edges.
- **Distance Calculation**:
  - The first DFS populates `cnt` (number of nodes in each subtree) and `res` (sum of distances for each node).
  - The second DFS adjusts these distances for all nodes based on their parent values.
  
### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes. Both DFS traversals go through each node and edge once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the adjacency list and the result arrays.
