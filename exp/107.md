### Problem Statement
Perform a level-order traversal on a binary tree, but return the result in bottom-up order (starting from the deepest level).

### Approach
1. Use a queue to perform a level-order traversal, storing each levelâ€™s nodes in a temporary vector.
2. After processing each level, push the vector onto a stack.
3. Once the entire tree is traversed, pop each level from the stack (which gives bottom-up order) and add it to the final result.

### Code Walk-through
- **Lines 5-6**: Initialize a queue `q` and a stack `stk`. If the root is `NULL`, return an empty result.
- **Line 8**: Push the root node onto the queue.
- **Lines 10-18**: While the queue is not empty:
  - Create a vector `ans` for the current level.
  - For each node in the current level, add its value to `ans` and enqueue its left and right children if they exist.
  - Push `ans` onto the stack after completing the level.
- **Lines 20-24**: Pop each level from `stk` and add it to the result list `ans` to achieve the bottom-up order.
- **Line 26**: Return `ans`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes, as each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\), due to storage required for the queue, stack, and result list.
