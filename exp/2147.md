### Problem Statement

In this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to pair students represented by 'S' in a corridor string. The corridor is a sequence of characters where each 'S' denotes a student, and we are required to form pairs of students such that each pair is separated by an even number of empty spaces. If it is not possible to pair all students according to the given rules, we return `0`.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Positions of Students**: First, we need to traverse the corridor string to find the indices of all the 'S' characters, as they represent students.

2. **Check for Valid Pairing**: We must ensure that the total number of students is even. If it is odd or zero, pairing all students is impossible, so we return `0`.

3. **Calculate the Number of Ways to Pair**: For each pair of students, we need to calculate the number of ways we can pair them based on the number of empty spaces between the pairs. This can be calculated as follows:
   - For each consecutive pair of students, compute the distance (number of empty spaces) between them.
   - The number of ways to choose a student from the available empty spaces increases with the distance.

4. **Return the Result**: Multiply the number of ways for each pair to get the total number of valid pairings. Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow and adhere to problem constraints.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
   ```
   - We define a constant `mod` which will be used to return the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   int numberOfWays(string corridor) {
   ```
   - The function `numberOfWays` takes a string `corridor` as an argument.

3. **Determine the Length of the Corridor**:
   ```cpp
   int n = corridor.size();
   ```
   - Here, we store the size of the corridor string in variable `n`.

4. **Collect Positions of Students**:
   ```cpp
   vector<int> itr;
   for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
       if(corridor[i] == 'S') 
           itr.push_back(i);
   ```
   - We create a vector `itr` to store the indices of 'S'. We iterate over the string and push the indices of 'S' into this vector.

5. **Check for Even Number of Students**:
   ```cpp
   if((itr.size() % 2) || (itr.size() == 0)) return 0;
   ```
   - If the number of 'S' is odd or zero, we return `0` since we cannot form pairs.

6. **Initialization for Result Calculation**:
   ```cpp
   long long res = 1;
   int prv = itr[1];
   ```
   - We initialize `res` to `1`, which will hold the final count of ways. `prv` is set to the second studentâ€™s index to calculate gaps from the first pair.

7. **Iterate Over Student Pairs**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 2; i < itr.size(); i += 2) {
       int len = itr[i] - prv;
       res = (res * len) % mod;
       prv = itr[i + 1];
   }
   ```
   - The loop increments by `2` to get each pair of students. Inside the loop:
     - We calculate the number of empty spaces between the current student and the previous student in the pair (`len = itr[i] - prv`).
     - We update `res` by multiplying it with `len`, using modulo to keep it within bounds.
     - `prv` is updated to the index of the current student to prepare for the next iteration.

8. **Return the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return res;
   }
   ```
   - Finally, the function returns the calculated result.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - We traverse the corridor string once to collect the indices of 'S', and another iteration occurs to compute the distances between pairs. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the length of the corridor.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(k)\)
  - The space complexity is determined by the vector that stores the indices of 'S'. In the worst case, all characters in the string could be 'S', resulting in \(O(n)\) space used for storing the indices. However, since 'S' can only occur a maximum of \(n\) times, it is more accurately represented as \(O(k)\) where \(k\) is the number of 'S'.

### Conclusion

The `numberOfWays` function efficiently counts the ways to pair students represented by 'S' in a corridor while adhering to specified pairing rules. By utilizing a straightforward counting mechanism based on the distances between students, this solution captures the essence of combinatorial logic in a clean and concise manner.

This approach not only highlights fundamental algorithm design techniques like linear traversal and modulus operations but also emphasizes the importance of validating conditions early in the algorithm to prevent unnecessary calculations. Understanding this method enhances the ability to solve similar combinatorial pairing problems in various contexts, making it a valuable technique in algorithmic problem-solving.
