### Problem Statement
Given two strings `o` and `s`, sort the characters of `s` such that the characters that appear in `o` come first in the order they appear in `o`, followed by the characters that do not appear in `o`, sorted in ascending order.

### Approach
1. **Mapping Order**:
   - Create a mapping from characters in string `o` to their respective indices to represent their order.

2. **Custom Sorting**:
   - Use the `sort` function with a custom comparator, which utilizes the mapping to determine the order of characters in `s`.
   - Characters in `o` are sorted according to their indices in the mapping, while characters not in `o` are sorted based on their natural order.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to sort the characters of string `s` based on string `o`.
    - `string customSortString(string o, string s)`: Main function that performs the custom sorting.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `o`: String defining the custom order for sorting.
        - `s`: String to be sorted based on the order defined in `o`.
      - **Returns**: The sorted string.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m log m), where \(m\) is the length of string `s`, due to the sorting operation.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where \(n\) is the size of the mapping used to store the order of characters from string `o`.
