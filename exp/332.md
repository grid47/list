### Problem Statement
You are given a list of flight tickets represented as pairs of departure and arrival airports. Each ticket is used exactly once, and you need to reconstruct the itinerary in order to visit all airports exactly once, starting from "JFK". The itinerary should be in lexical order.

### Approach
The approach to solving this problem involves using Depth-First Search (DFS) combined with a priority queue to ensure that we always visit the next airport in lexical order.

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Use a `map` to create a graph (`gph`) where the key is the departure airport and the value is a priority queue containing all possible arrival airports sorted in ascending order.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Start the DFS from "JFK".
   - While there are airports available to visit from the current airport, pop the next airport from the priority queue and recursively call DFS on that airport.
   - After all reachable airports have been visited, prepend the current airport to the result list (`res`). This ensures that the airports are added in reverse order of their visits.

3. **Constructing the Result**:
   - Convert the result list to a vector of strings for the final output.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A vector of flight tickets `tcks`, where each ticket is a pair of strings `[departure, arrival]`.
- **Output**: A vector of strings representing the itinerary starting from "JFK".

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(E \log E)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges (tickets). This accounts for the time taken to maintain the priority queue for each airport.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of unique airports and \(E\) is the number of tickets. This includes space for the graph and the result list.
