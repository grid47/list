### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find the **itinerary** of a journey, where the itinerary is a path that uses all available tickets exactly once. Each ticket represents a directed flight between two airports. You are given a list of tickets (where each ticket is a pair of airports) and must return the itinerary in **lexicographically smallest order**. The starting airport is always `"JFK"`, and you need to form the full travel route from the available tickets.

### Approach

To solve the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest itinerary, we can employ a **Depth First Search (DFS)** strategy along with a **priority queue** to ensure we always visit the lexicographically smallest airport at each step.

#### Key Insights:
1. **Graph Representation**: 
   - We can represent the airports and their connections as a **directed graph**, where each airport points to a set of destination airports.
   - To ensure that we always choose the lexicographically smallest airport, we use a **priority queue** for each airport, so the next airport to visit is always the smallest one.
   
2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - Starting from `"JFK"`, we recursively explore each destination airport, visiting the smallest available one first, and marking it as visited.
   - As we visit each airport, we push the airport to the front of the result list to ensure that the final order is correct (since the journey is constructed in reverse order from end to start).

3. **Using a Map**:
   - A map (`gph`) is used to store each airport’s list of destinations in the form of a **priority queue**. This allows efficient lexicographical ordering of destinations.
   
4. **Backtracking**:
   - The DFS is performed by recursively visiting each airport from the current airport, removing visited destinations until no more destinations are left for that airport, and then backtracking to previous airports.

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The case when no tickets are provided is implicitly handled since we initialize the graph and simply return an empty list if no tickets exist.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let’s break down the code to understand how the approach is implemented:

#### Step 1: Map Initialization
```cpp
map<string, priority_queue<string, vector<string>, greater<string>>> gph;
```
- A `map` named `gph` is declared to represent the graph, where the key is the airport code (a string), and the value is a **priority queue** containing all destination airports. The priority queue is initialized to order the airports lexicographically (smallest first).

#### Step 2: Building the Graph
```cpp
for(auto it: tcks) {
    gph[it[0]].push(it[1]);
}
```
- Here, we iterate over each ticket (a vector of two strings: origin and destination airport). For each ticket, we add the destination airport to the priority queue of the corresponding origin airport in the `gph` map. This helps in building the graph where each airport points to a set of possible destinations, sorted lexicographically.

#### Step 3: DFS Traversal and Itinerary Construction
```cpp
dfs("JFK");
```
- The DFS function is called with `"JFK"` as the starting point. This will begin the process of recursively visiting each airport starting from `"JFK"`.

#### Step 4: Depth First Search Function (`dfs`)
```cpp
void dfs(string from) {
    while(gph.count(from) && !gph[from].empty()) {
        string x = gph[from].top();
        gph[from].pop();
        dfs(x);
    }
    res.push_front(from);
}
```
- The DFS function explores all reachable airports starting from the current airport `from`:
  - It checks if there are any remaining destinations for the current airport (`gph[from]`).
  - If there are, it takes the lexicographically smallest destination (using the `top()` of the priority queue), removes it from the queue (`pop()`), and recursively calls `dfs()` on that destination airport.
  - Once all destinations for a particular airport are visited, the airport is added to the front of the result list `res` using `push_front()`, so that we can build the itinerary in reverse order.

#### Step 5: Final Result Construction
```cpp
vector<string> ans;
for(auto it: res)
    ans.push_back(it);
return ans;
```
- After the DFS traversal is completed, the result list `res` contains the itinerary in reverse order. We convert the list to a vector `ans` and return it as the final result.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(E log E)**: The main time complexity is dominated by the operations on the priority queues, where `E` is the number of edges (tickets). For each airport, we might need to insert and remove from the priority queue, which takes **O(log E)** time. Since there are `E` tickets, the overall time complexity is **O(E log E)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(E)**: The space complexity is mainly due to the storage required for the graph representation and the recursion stack used by the DFS. The graph uses a map of size **O(E)** to store the priority queues, and the recursion stack in the DFS can have a depth of **O(E)** in the worst case (when all airports are directly or indirectly connected in a chain).

### Conclusion

This approach efficiently constructs the lexicographically smallest itinerary using a depth-first search (DFS) combined with priority queues. The key insight is the use of a **priority queue** to ensure we always explore the smallest airport first, while backtracking and constructing the itinerary in reverse order. 

- **Greedy Nature**: The use of the priority queue ensures that we follow a greedy strategy of always picking the lexicographically smallest destination at each step, ensuring an optimal solution.
- **DFS**: The DFS traversal ensures that we explore the entire journey path from start to finish, while respecting the order of the tickets.
- **Optimal Time Complexity**: The solution performs efficiently with a time complexity of **O(E log E)**, where `E` is the number of tickets, which is the best possible given the need to manage and sort the destinations lexicographically.

This algorithm is both time-efficient and easy to understand, and it works effectively even for large input sizes due to its greedy and backtracking approach.
