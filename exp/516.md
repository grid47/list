### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in `s`.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a 2D array `memo` to store the lengths of the longest palindromic subsequences for different substrings of `s`.
   - The dimensions of the array will be `n x n`, where `n` is the length of the string.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Implement a recursive function `dp(i, j)` that computes the longest palindromic subsequence length for the substring `s[i..j]`.
   - Base cases:
     - If `i == j`, it means the substring is a single character, which is a palindrome of length 1.
     - If `i == j - 1`, check if the two characters are the same:
       - If they are, return 2 (both characters form a palindrome).
       - If not, return 1 (either character can form a palindrome).

3. **Memoization**:
   - If the value for `memo[i][j]` has already been computed, return that value to avoid redundant calculations.

4. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - If `s[i] == s[j]`, the characters can contribute to a palindromic subsequence, so add 2 to the result of `dp(i + 1, j - 1)`.
   - If they are not equal, take the maximum of the results from the two possible options: excluding the character at the beginning or the end of the substring.

5. **Result Computation**:
   - Call the `dp(0, n - 1)` function, which considers the entire string, to get the final result.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `longestPalindromeSubseq` function initializes the string and the memoization table.

2. **Recursive DP Call**:
   - The function `dp(i, j)` is called with the entire range of the string.

3. **Memoization Check**:
   - The function checks if the result for the current substring has been computed and stored in `memo`.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - Handle the single character and two-character cases directly.

5. **Recursion and Memoization**:
   - Calculate the result based on the conditions and store it in `memo` before returning.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the length of the string, since each substring is computed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2), due to the memoization table used for storing results of computed subproblems.
