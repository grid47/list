### Problem Statement

The task is to find the **longest palindromic subsequence** (LPS) in a given string. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. A palindromic subsequence is one that reads the same backward as forward.

For example:
- In the string `"bbbab"`, the longest palindromic subsequence is `"bbbb"`.
- In the string `"cbbd"`, the longest palindromic subsequence is `"bb"`.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we use **dynamic programming (DP)**. The idea is to break the problem into smaller subproblems, each solving a subpart of the string and storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

The basic idea behind the DP solution is to compute the longest palindromic subsequence for substrings of the input string. If the characters at the two ends of a substring match, they can be part of the palindrome. If not, the solution is the maximum value obtained by excluding either the left or the right character and computing the LPS for the remaining substring.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Base Case**: A string of length 1 is always a palindrome, so `dp(i, i) = 1`.
2. **Pair Matching**: If the characters at the two ends of the substring match (`str[i] == str[j]`), the length of the palindromic subsequence can be extended by 2, i.e., `dp(i, j) = 2 + dp(i + 1, j - 1)`.
3. **Maximize by Excluding Characters**: If the characters don't match, the longest subsequence can be obtained by excluding either the left or right character. Thus, `dp(i, j) = max(dp(i + 1, j), dp(i, j - 1))`.

This approach uses memoization (caching the results of subproblems) to optimize the time complexity. Memoization helps avoid recalculating the same subproblem multiple times.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's break down the code into its components and explain each part:

1. **Class Definition and Member Variables**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
       string str;
       vector<vector<int>> memo;
   ```
   - The `str` variable holds the input string.
   - `memo` is a 2D vector used to store the results of subproblems, where `memo[i][j]` represents the longest palindromic subsequence between indices `i` and `j` in the string `str`. Initially, it is filled with `-1` to indicate that no subproblem has been solved yet.

2. **DP Function (Recursive)**:
   ```cpp
   int dp(int i, int j) {
       if(i == j) return 1;
       if(i == j - 1) return str[i] == str[j]? 2 : 1;
       
       if(memo[i][j] != -1) return memo[i][j];
       
       int ans = 0;
       if(str[i] == str[j]) {
           ans = 2 + dp(i + 1, j - 1);
       } else {
           ans = max(dp(i + 1, j), dp(i, j - 1));
       }
       return memo[i][j] = ans;
   }
   ```
   - **Base Cases**:
     - If `i == j`, it means we are considering a single character, which is always a palindrome of length 1.
     - If `i == j - 1`, we are looking at two adjacent characters. If they are equal, the palindromic subsequence is of length 2; otherwise, it is 1 (each character alone).
   - **Memoization Check**: If `memo[i][j]` is not `-1`, it means the subproblem has already been solved, and we can return the cached result.
   - **Recursive Computation**:
     - If `str[i] == str[j]`, then these two characters can be part of the palindrome, so we add 2 to the result of `dp(i + 1, j - 1)`.
     - If `str[i] != str[j]`, we compute the LPS by excluding either the left or right character: `max(dp(i + 1, j), dp(i, j - 1))`.
   - The result is stored in `memo[i][j]` to be reused later.

3. **Main Function to Initialize and Call the DP**:
   ```cpp
   int longestPalindromeSubseq(string s) {
       str = s;
       int n = s.size();
       memo.resize(n, vector<int>(n, -1));
       return dp(0, n - 1);
   }
   ```
   - The `longestPalindromeSubseq` function initializes the `str` variable with the input string `s` and the `memo` table to store the results of subproblems.
   - It then calls the `dp(0, n - 1)` function, which starts the recursive calculation for the entire string.
   - Finally, it returns the result, which is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the string.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^2)**: The time complexity of this solution is quadratic because we are solving each subproblem for all pairs `(i, j)` where `i <= j`, resulting in `O(n^2)` subproblems. For each subproblem, we perform constant-time operations (comparison and recursion).
  
#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n^2)**: We use a 2D memoization table `memo` of size `n x n` to store the results of subproblems. Therefore, the space complexity is also quadratic.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string using dynamic programming with memoization. By breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems and reusing previously computed results, the solution avoids redundant calculations and achieves optimal performance. The time and space complexity of O(n^2) make this approach feasible for relatively large input sizes.

This technique is applicable to other string manipulation problems that require finding subsequences, such as the longest common subsequence (LCS) and edit distance, making it a versatile tool for solving a wide range of dynamic programming problems.
