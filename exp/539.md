### Problem Statement
Given a list of 24-hour clock time strings, find the minimum difference in minutes between any two times in the list.

### Approach
1. **Sorting the Times**:
   - First, sort the time strings in ascending order. This helps in calculating the differences easily since the closest times will be adjacent in the sorted list.

2. **Calculating Differences**:
   - Loop through the sorted time strings and calculate the absolute time difference between each time and its predecessor. Use modulo arithmetic to wrap around the list and calculate the difference between the last and first times as well.

3. **Handling Wrap-around Cases**:
   - Since the time is on a 24-hour clock, ensure to consider the wrap-around difference between the last time and the first time in the sorted list. This is done by subtracting the time difference from 1440 (the total number of minutes in a day).

4. **Finding Minimum Difference**:
   - Track the minimum difference encountered during the iterations.

### Code Walk-through
- **Sorting**: The times are sorted to allow easy calculation of differences.
- **Difference Calculation**: The `timeDiff` function calculates the difference in minutes between two time strings:
  - Convert hours and minutes from the strings to integers and calculate the difference.
- **Main Loop**: Iterate through the sorted list, calculate differences, and update the minimum difference.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of time strings due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since only a few integer variables are used and the input list is modified in-place.
