### Problem Statement
In a game with an array of integers, two players take turns to choose an integer and remove it from the array. The player who is unable to make a move (because the array is empty) loses. The goal is to determine if the first player can guarantee a win given the initial array.

### Approach
1. **XOR Calculation**:
   - Calculate the XOR of all the elements in the array.
   - This value determines the game's outcome based on its properties.

2. **Winning Conditions**:
   - If the XOR of all elements (`net`) is zero, the first player will always win if both play optimally. This is because a zero XOR implies that the current player can always respond in a way to maintain a zero XOR state.
   - If the array size is even, the first player can always pair numbers to ensure they can match the second player's moves, allowing them to win regardless of the XOR.
   - If the XOR is non-zero and the array size is odd, the first player may not have a guaranteed strategy for winning.

3. **Return Result**:
   - The function returns `true` if the first player can guarantee a win (when `net` is zero or the array size is even), otherwise returns `false`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains methods to determine the winner of the game.
    - `bool xorGame(vector<int>& nums)`: The main function to determine if the first player can guarantee a win.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `nums`: A vector of integers representing the array of numbers.
      - **Returns**: A boolean indicating whether the first player can guarantee a win.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array, since we iterate through the array once to compute the XOR.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only a few integer variables are used for calculation and no additional space is allocated.
