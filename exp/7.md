### 💡 **Reverse Integer Problem** – Let's Reverse It!

The **Reverse Integer** problem is a great exercise to enhance your understanding of integer manipulation and overflow handling. The task is simple: reverse the digits of a 32-bit signed integer `x`, but be mindful of the edge cases where the reversal may cause an overflow. Let’s break it down step by step and explore the best approach.

### 📝 **Problem Statement**

You are given a **32-bit signed integer `x`** and asked to reverse its digits. The catch? If the reversed integer overflows, or the result isn't a valid 32-bit integer, you should return `0`.

### **Constraints**:
- The reversed integer must be within the valid range for a 32-bit signed integer: **`[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`**, i.e., from `-2147483648` to `2147483647`.

### Example:
- **Input**: `x = 123`  
  **Output**: `321`

- **Input**: `x = -123`  
  **Output**: `-321`

- **Input**: `x = 120`  
  **Output**: `21`

- **Input**: `x = 0`  
  **Output**: `0`

### 🚨 **Overflow Alert**:  
Reversing large numbers may cause an overflow. For instance, reversing `1534236469` would cause an overflow, and the output should be `0`.

### 🔍 **Approach: Reversing with Care**

To solve this problem, we need to reverse the digits of `x` and check for overflow cases. The algorithm is straightforward but requires careful handling of potential overflows.

1. **Reverse the Digits**: Extract the last digit of `x` using `x % 10`, append it to the reversed number, and divide `x` by `10` to remove the last digit.
2. **Handle Overflow**: Ensure that the reversed number doesn’t exceed the 32-bit signed integer limits:
   - **Overflow**: If the result goes beyond `INT_MAX` (`2147483647`), or below `INT_MIN` (`-2147483648`), return `0`.
3. **Edge Case**: If `x` is `0`, simply return `0`.

### **Code Breakdown (Step-by-Step)**

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

```cpp
int rev = 0, pop;
```

- `rev`: Holds the reversed number as we build it.
- `pop`: Temporarily stores the last digit of `x` in each iteration.

#### Step 2: Loop to Reverse the Number

```cpp
while(x != 0)
{
    pop  = x % 10;
    x   /= 10;
```

- The loop continues as long as `x` is not `0`.
- `pop = x % 10` extracts the last digit of `x`.
- `x /= 10` removes the last digit by performing integer division.

#### Step 3: Check for Overflow Conditions

```cpp
if( (rev > INT_MAX/10 || (rev == INT_MAX/10 && pop > 7)) || 
    (rev < INT_MIN/10 || (rev == INT_MIN/10 && pop < -8)) )
    return 0;
```

- **Overflow for Positive Numbers**: If `rev` exceeds `INT_MAX / 10`, multiplying by 10 will overflow. If `rev == INT_MAX / 10`, adding `pop` could exceed `INT_MAX` if `pop > 7`.
  
- **Overflow for Negative Numbers**: Similarly, if `rev < INT_MIN / 10`, it would underflow. If `rev == INT_MIN / 10`, adding `pop` could cause underflow if `pop < -8`.

If any of these conditions are met, the function returns `0` to indicate an overflow.

#### Step 4: Update the Reversed Number

```cpp
rev = rev * 10 + pop;
```

- The reversed number is built by multiplying `rev` by `10` (shifting its digits left) and adding `pop` (the extracted digit).

#### Step 5: Return the Result

```cpp
return rev;
```

- Once `x` becomes `0`, the loop finishes and returns the reversed number.

### ⏱️ **Time and Space Complexity**

#### Time Complexity: **O(log(x))**
- The time complexity depends on the number of digits in `x`. Since each iteration removes one digit, the loop runs approximately `log(x)` times, where `x` is the absolute value of the number.

#### Space Complexity: **O(1)**
- We are using only a constant amount of space (`rev` and `pop`), so the space complexity is constant.

### 🎯 **Conclusion: Reverse with Precision**

This approach efficiently reverses the digits of an integer while ensuring we handle potential overflow cases. The key takeaway? **Overflow checks** are crucial when working with large integers.

- **Pro Tip**: Always ensure the result stays within the valid 32-bit range to avoid unexpected behaviors.
- **Practice Makes Perfect**: This problem is an excellent exercise in integer manipulation and overflow handling, so try solving similar problems to sharpen your skills further.
