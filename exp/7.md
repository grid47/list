### Problem Statement
Given a 32-bit signed integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If the reversed integer overflows, return 0.

### Approach
Iteratively extract the last digit of `x` and build the reversed number. Before updating the reversed number, check for overflow conditions to ensure the result remains within the 32-bit signed integer range.

### Code Walk-through
1. Initialize `rev` to 0, which will hold the reversed number, and `pop` to store the last digit of `x`.
2. Use a while loop to iterate until `x` becomes 0:
   - Extract the last digit (`pop`) using `x % 10`.
   - Reduce `x` by removing the last digit (`x /= 10`).
   - Check for overflow conditions before updating `rev`:
     - If `rev` is greater than `INT_MAX/10` or equal to `INT_MAX/10` and `pop` is greater than 7, it will overflow.
     - If `rev` is less than `INT_MIN/10` or equal to `INT_MIN/10` and `pop` is less than -8, it will underflow.
   - Update `rev` by multiplying it by 10 and adding `pop`.
3. Return the final value of `rev`. If an overflow was detected, return 0.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(\log_{10}(n))\) - where \(n\) is the absolute value of `x`, since we are processing each digit.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) - no additional space is used aside from a few variables.
