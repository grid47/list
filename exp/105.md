### Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays, `preorder` and `inorder`, representing the preorder and inorder traversals of a binary tree, construct and return the binary tree.

### Approach
1. The first element in the `preorder` array is always the root of the tree or subtree.
2. Use the `inorder` array to determine the boundary between left and right subtrees.
3. Recursively build the tree:
   - For each subtree, determine the root using the next element in `preorder`.
   - Find the root index in `inorder` using a hash map for O(1) lookups.
   - Split the `inorder` list around the root to define left and right subtrees.
   - Recursively apply the same logic to build both left and right subtrees.

### Code Walk-through
- **Lines 4-7**: Store `preorder` and `inorder` arrays as class members and create a map `mp` to store indices of `inorder` elements for fast lookup.
- **Lines 9-12**: The function `helper` constructs the tree recursively:
  - **Base Case**: If `ps` (preorder start index) exceeds bounds or `is > ie` (inorder start and end indices are out of range), return `NULL`.
  - **Recursive Case**: Set `root` as the node with the current `preorder[ps]` value. Use `mp[root->val]` to split `inorder` and recursively build left and right subtrees.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes, as each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\), for the hash map and recursion stack.
