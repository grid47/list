### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find the minimum number of operations required to reduce a given integer `n` to 1 using the following operations:
1. If `n` is even, divide `n` by 2.
2. If `n` is odd, either increment or decrement `n` by 1.

The goal is to return the minimum number of operations needed to reach `1`.

### Approach

The problem can be approached using a greedy strategy. At each step, we aim to reduce the number `n` as efficiently as possible. Specifically:
- If `n` is even, we can simply divide `n` by 2, which is the most efficient operation.
- If `n` is odd, we have two possible choices: increment or decrement `n`. To minimize the number of operations, we can make a decision based on the structure of `n`:
  - If `n + 1` is divisible by 4, it might be more optimal to increment `n` (since it will result in a faster halving in the next steps).
  - Otherwise, decrement `n` to make it even and prepare for division by 2.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let’s break down the code in detail:

#### Step 1: Handle the edge case for `INT_MAX`
```cpp
if(n == INT_MAX) return 32;
```
- The problem specifies that `n` could be very large, and one special case is `INT_MAX`, which is `2^31 - 1`. We know from the structure of the number that it will always require 32 steps to reach 1 (because of its binary form). Thus, we immediately return 32 for this case.

#### Step 2: Initialize the counter
```cpp
int cnt = 0;
```
- A counter `cnt` is initialized to 0. This counter will track the number of operations needed to reduce `n` to 1.

#### Step 3: Main loop to reduce `n`
```cpp
while(n > 1) {
    if(n % 2 == 0) n /= 2;
    else {
        if((n + 1) % 4 == 0 && (n - 1) != 2) n++;
        else n--;
    }
    cnt++;
}
```
- The loop continues until `n` becomes 1.
- If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), we divide `n` by 2. This is the most efficient operation because halving reduces the number the fastest.
- If `n` is odd, we have two choices:
  - **Increment `n`**: This happens if `(n + 1) % 4 == 0` and `(n - 1) != 2`. The condition `(n + 1) % 4 == 0` suggests that incrementing `n` will lead to a faster reduction in future steps by making `n` divisible by 4.
  - **Decrement `n`**: If the condition is not met, we decrement `n` to make it even. This allows us to use the division operation in the next step.
- After each operation, we increment the counter `cnt` to record that we have performed one operation.

#### Step 4: Return the result
```cpp
return cnt;
```
- After `n` is reduced to 1, the function returns `cnt`, which holds the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to 1.

### Example Walkthrough

Let’s walk through an example to understand the behavior of the algorithm:

#### Example 1:
```cpp
integerReplacement(8);
```
1. **Initial value of `n` = 8**:
   - `n` is even, so divide by 2: `n = 8 / 2 = 4`
   - `cnt = 1`
   
2. **`n` = 4**:
   - `n` is even, so divide by 2: `n = 4 / 2 = 2`
   - `cnt = 2`
   
3. **`n` = 2**:
   - `n` is even, so divide by 2: `n = 2 / 2 = 1`
   - `cnt = 3`
   
The function returns `cnt = 3`, meaning it took 3 operations to reduce `n = 8` to 1.

#### Example 2:
```cpp
integerReplacement(7);
```
1. **Initial value of `n` = 7**:
   - `n` is odd, and `(n + 1) % 4 == 0` (since 8 is divisible by 4), so increment `n`: `n = 7 + 1 = 8`
   - `cnt = 1`
   
2. **`n` = 8**:
   - `n` is even, so divide by 2: `n = 8 / 2 = 4`
   - `cnt = 2`
   
3. **`n` = 4**:
   - `n` is even, so divide by 2: `n = 4 / 2 = 2`
   - `cnt = 3`
   
4. **`n` = 2**:
   - `n` is even, so divide by 2: `n = 2 / 2 = 1`
   - `cnt = 4`
   
The function returns `cnt = 4`, meaning it took 4 operations to reduce `n = 7` to 1.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)`. In each iteration, `n` is halved (for even numbers), or adjusted by 1 and then halved in the next step (for odd numbers). This logarithmic reduction continues until `n` becomes 1. Therefore, the time complexity is proportional to the logarithm of `n`, i.e., `O(log n)`.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`. The solution uses a constant amount of space, as we are only storing a few variables like `cnt`, `n`, and a few temporary variables. No additional data structures are used that grow with input size.

### Conclusion

This approach efficiently reduces the given integer `n` to 1 using a greedy strategy that minimizes the number of operations. By choosing the most optimal operation (either increment or decrement) for odd values and dividing even values by 2, the solution ensures that the number of operations is minimized. The time complexity of `O(log n)` and space complexity of `O(1)` make this solution both time-efficient and space-efficient, even for large values of `n`.
