### Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer `n`. You can perform the following operations on `n`:

1. If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
2. If `n` is odd, you can either:
   - Increment `n` by 1, or
   - Decrement `n` by 1.

Your goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to 1.

### Approach
1. **Check for Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is `INT_MAX`, return `32` directly, as reducing `INT_MAX` to `1` requires `32` operations.

2. **Loop Until `n` Equals 1**:
   - Use a loop that continues until `n` becomes `1`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `n` is even, perform the operation `n /= 2`.
     - If `n` is odd:
       - Check if incrementing `n` leads to a number that can be halved down to `1` in fewer steps:
         - If `(n + 1) % 4 == 0` and `(n - 1) != 2`, increment `n` (to take advantage of more even divisions).
         - Otherwise, decrement `n`.

3. **Count Operations**:
   - Keep a counter that tracks the number of operations performed and increment it after each operation.

### Code Walk-through
- The function initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
- It uses a while loop to modify `n` according to the even or odd condition and tracks the number of operations until `n` equals `1`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), as each operation effectively reduces the value of `n` significantly, especially when dividing by 2.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since no additional data structures are used that scale with input size.
