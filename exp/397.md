### 🚀 Problem Statement

The problem asks us to determine the **minimum number of operations** required to reduce a given integer `n` to 1 using the following operations:

1. If `n` is **even**, divide `n` by 2.
2. If `n` is **odd**, either increment or decrement `n` by 1.

Our goal is to return the minimum number of operations needed to reach `1` from `n`. Let's dive into the approach to tackle this problem efficiently! 😎

### 🧠 Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a **greedy strategy** that aims to reduce the number `n` as efficiently as possible:

- If `n` is **even**, we divide `n` by 2, as it's the most efficient operation.
- If `n` is **odd**, we have two options:
  - **Increment `n`**: If `(n + 1) % 4 == 0` (i.e., `n + 1` is divisible by 4), this will potentially allow us to reach a number that can be halved more quickly in the next steps.
  - **Decrement `n`**: If the condition is not met, we decrement `n` to make it even, allowing us to use the division operation.

By making these decisions, we aim to minimize the number of steps to reach 1. Let's break it down! 💡

### 🔨 Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Let’s walk through the code and understand how it works:

#### Step 1: Handle the Edge Case for `INT_MAX`
```cpp
if(n == INT_MAX) return 32;
```
- If `n` is equal to **`INT_MAX`** (i.e., `2^31 - 1`), we can directly return `32`, since we know from its binary structure that it will always take exactly 32 steps to reach 1. This is a shortcut for efficiency. 🚀

---

#### Step 2: Initialize the Counter
```cpp
int cnt = 0;
```
- We initialize a counter `cnt` to **track** the number of operations we perform. Every time we modify `n`, we increase this counter.

---

#### Step 3: Main Loop to Reduce `n`
```cpp
while(n > 1) {
    if(n % 2 == 0) n /= 2;
    else {
        if((n + 1) % 4 == 0 && (n - 1) != 2) n++;
        else n--;
    }
    cnt++;
}
```
- We enter a loop that continues **until `n` becomes 1**.
- If `n` is **even**, we simply divide it by 2. This operation drastically reduces the value of `n`. 📉
- If `n` is **odd**, we decide whether to increment or decrement:
  - **Increment** `n` if `(n + 1) % 4 == 0` and `(n - 1) != 2`, because making `n + 1` divisible by 4 can potentially lead to faster halving.
  - **Decrement** `n` otherwise, so it becomes even and we can divide it in the next step. 🔄
- After each operation, we increment `cnt` to keep track of the number of steps taken. ⏳

#### Step 4: Return the Result
```cpp
return cnt;
```
- Once `n` becomes 1, we return `cnt`, which holds the **minimum number of operations** required to reduce `n` to 1. 🏁

### 📈 Example Walkthrough

Let's go through a couple of examples to see how the algorithm works in action! 🎬

#### Example 1: `n = 8`
```cpp
integerReplacement(8);
```
1. **Initial value of `n = 8`**:
   - `n` is **even**, so divide by 2: `n = 8 / 2 = 4` (1 operation)
   - `cnt = 1`
   
2. **`n = 4`**:
   - `n` is **even**, so divide by 2: `n = 4 / 2 = 2` (1 operation)
   - `cnt = 2`
   
3. **`n = 2`**:
   - `n` is **even**, so divide by 2: `n = 2 / 2 = 1` (1 operation)
   - `cnt = 3`
   
**Result**: The function returns `cnt = 3`, meaning it took **3 operations** to reduce `n = 8` to 1. 🏆

---

#### Example 2: `n = 7`
```cpp
integerReplacement(7);
```
1. **Initial value of `n = 7`**:
   - `n` is **odd**, and `(n + 1) % 4 == 0` (because 8 is divisible by 4), so **increment** `n`: `n = 7 + 1 = 8` (1 operation)
   - `cnt = 1`
   
2. **`n = 8`**:
   - `n` is **even**, so divide by 2: `n = 8 / 2 = 4` (1 operation)
   - `cnt = 2`
   
3. **`n = 4`**:
   - `n` is **even**, so divide by 2: `n = 4 / 2 = 2` (1 operation)
   - `cnt = 3`
   
4. **`n = 2`**:
   - `n` is **even**, so divide by 2: `n = 2 / 2 = 1` (1 operation)
   - `cnt = 4`
   
**Result**: The function returns `cnt = 4`, meaning it took **4 operations** to reduce `n = 7` to 1. 🏅

### 📊 Complexity Analysis

Let’s analyze the time and space complexity of this solution:

#### ⏱️ Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)`. In each iteration, `n` is halved (for even numbers) or adjusted by 1 and halved in the next step (for odd numbers). This logarithmic reduction continues until `n` becomes 1, so the time complexity is proportional to the logarithm of `n`, i.e., `O(log n)`. 📉

#### 🧠 Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`. The solution uses a constant amount of space because we only store a few variables like `cnt`, `n`, and a few temporary values. No additional data structures are used. 🧳

### 🏁 Conclusion

In conclusion, this approach provides an **efficient way** to reduce a given integer `n` to 1 by using a greedy strategy. By deciding whether to increment or decrement `n` based on the structure of the number, we minimize the number of operations. With a time complexity of `O(log n)` and space complexity of `O(1)`, this solution is both **time-efficient** and **space-efficient**! 🚀

So, no matter how large `n` is, you can now reduce it to 1 in a minimal number of operations. Keep coding, and don’t forget to challenge yourself with new problems! 💪
