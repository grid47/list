### Problem Statement

The task is to count the number of valid palindrome substrings in a given string `s` that satisfy the following conditions:
- The string `s` consists of digits, each between '0' and '9'.
- A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.
- We need to count all valid palindrome substrings in `s` where the string length is at least 4 and at most 6.

### Approach

The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming and prefix/suffix counting techniques. The key observation is that for a palindrome, the first half of the palindrome determines the second half. By breaking down the problem into counting certain types of substrings, we can efficiently solve it.

The strategy involves:
1. **Using a dynamic programming approach to count occurrences of two-digit pairs**: We count how often a pair of digits occurs in the prefix and suffix of the string.
2. **Prefix and Suffix Counting**: As we iterate through the string, we maintain two arrays (`pre` and `suf`) that store the cumulative counts of all two-digit pairs.
3. **Efficient Counting**: After processing the string with prefix and suffix counts, we then compute the number of palindromes by considering every possible position for the middle of the palindrome and counting how many valid palindromes can be formed.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's break down the code into manageable steps to understand how it solves the problem:

#### 1. **Variable Initialization**

```cpp
int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
int pre[10001][10][10], suf[10001][10][10], cnt[10] = {};
memset(pre, 0, sizeof(pre));
```

- `mod` is used for the modulo operation, ensuring the result stays within integer limits by using `1e9 + 7`.
- Arrays `pre` and `suf` are initialized to store the prefix and suffix counts of two-digit pairs. `pre[i][j][k]` represents the number of occurrences of the pair (j, k) in the prefix of the string up to index `i`.
- `cnt` is a temporary array that helps in counting individual digits as we process the string.

#### 2. **Processing the Prefix Array**

```cpp
int n = s.size();
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int c = s[i] - '0';
    if(i)
        for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
            for(int k = 0; k < 10; k++) {
                pre[i][j][k] = pre[i - 1][j][k];
                if(k == c) pre[i][j][k] += cnt[j];
            }
    cnt[c]++;
}
```

- The loop iterates through the string `s` and processes each character.
- For each character, it computes its numeric value `c` (the digit in the string).
- The nested loops update the `pre` array. It copies the previous counts from `pre[i - 1]`, then updates it by adding counts where the second digit of the pair matches the current character `c`. This keeps track of how many pairs `(j, c)` have occurred up to index `i`.
- `cnt[c]` is used to count how many times the current digit `c` has appeared up to index `i`.

#### 3. **Processing the Suffix Array**

```cpp
memset(suf, 0, sizeof(suf));
memset(cnt, 0, sizeof(cnt));        
for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int c = s[i] - '0';
    if(i < n - 1)
        for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
            for(int k = 0; k < 10; k++) {
                suf[i][j][k] = suf[i + 1][j][k];
                if(k == c) suf[i][j][k] += cnt[j];
            }
    cnt[c]++;
}
```

- The `suf` array is initialized to store the suffix counts. `suf[i][j][k]` represents the number of occurrences of the pair `(j, k)` in the suffix starting from index `i`.
- The second loop processes the string from right to left. For each character, it computes its numeric value `c` and updates the `suf` array similarly to how the `pre` array was updated. It uses `cnt[c]` to count how many times the current digit `c` has appeared in the suffix.

#### 4. **Counting Valid Palindromes**

```cpp
long long ans = 0;
for(int i = 2; i < n - 2; i++)
    for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
        for(int k = 0; k < 10; k++)
            ans = (ans + 1LL * pre[i - 1][j][k] * suf[i + 1][j][k]) % mod;
```

- This section calculates the number of valid palindromes using the `pre` and `suf` arrays.
- We iterate through each possible position `i` (from 2 to `n - 2`) which represents the middle of the palindrome.
- For each possible digit pair `(j, k)`, we compute the number of palindromes where the first half is formed by the pair `(j, k)` in the prefix, and the second half is formed by the same pair `(j, k)` in the suffix. This is calculated by multiplying the corresponding values in `pre[i - 1][j][k]` and `suf[i + 1][j][k]`.
- The result is accumulated in `ans`, and modulo `1e9 + 7` is applied to prevent overflow.

#### 5. **Returning the Final Result**

```cpp
return ans;
```

- Finally, the total count of valid palindromes is returned.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **Prefix and Suffix Processing**: Each of these loops runs over the string `s` once, and for each character, we perform operations on a constant number of pairs (at most 100 pairs, since each pair consists of two digits, and there are 10 possible digits). Therefore, the time complexity of processing the `pre` and `suf` arrays is **O(n * 100)**, where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Counting Palindromes**: In the final loop, we iterate over the possible palindrome centers and the digit pairs, performing a constant amount of work for each combination. This also takes **O(n * 100)** time.
- Thus, the total time complexity is **O(n * 100) = O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is dominated by the `pre`, `suf`, and `cnt` arrays, which all use **O(n * 100)** space. This leads to a total space complexity of **O(n * 100) = O(n)**.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently counts the number of valid palindrome substrings of length 4 to 6 using dynamic programming and prefix/suffix counting techniques. By maintaining and updating the `pre` and `suf` arrays as we process the string, we avoid recomputing counts for every possible substring, leading to a linear time complexity solution.
