### Problem Statement

The problem requires determining if a given list of integers represents valid UTF-8 encoded data. UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding scheme used to encode all possible characters, or code points, in Unicode. In UTF-8 encoding:
- A 1-byte character (ASCII) is represented by 0xxxxxxx.
- A 2-byte character is represented by 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx.
- A 3-byte character is represented by 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx.
- A 4-byte character is represented by 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx.

The task is to verify if a given sequence of bytes is a valid UTF-8 encoded string.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to parse the list of integers representing the UTF-8 encoded bytes and ensure each byte is valid according to the UTF-8 specification. The approach will involve:
1. Iterating through the array of bytes.
2. Using bitwise operations to identify the number of continuation bytes (those that begin with `10`).
3. Checking the validity of each byte and ensuring the correct number of continuation bytes follow the leading byte.

We can break the process into the following steps:

1. **First byte validation**: The leading byte determines the number of continuation bytes. If the leading byte starts with:
   - `0xxxxxxx` (ASCII character), there are no continuation bytes.
   - `110xxxxx` (2-byte character), it must be followed by a byte starting with `10xxxxxx`.
   - `1110xxxx` (3-byte character), it must be followed by two bytes starting with `10xxxxxx`.
   - `11110xxx` (4-byte character), it must be followed by three bytes starting with `10xxxxxx`.
   
2. **Continuation byte validation**: Every continuation byte must start with `10`, meaning the first two bits of each continuation byte must be `10xxxxxx`.

3. **End of sequence validation**: After processing all the bytes, if we have encountered an incomplete character (i.e., `count != 0`), it means the sequence is invalid.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize the Count of Continuation Bytes

```cpp
int count = 0;
```

- The variable `count` will keep track of how many continuation bytes are expected for the current character. Initially, `count` is set to 0 because no continuation bytes are expected at the beginning.

#### Step 2: Iterate Over the Data

```cpp
for(auto c : data) {
```

- We iterate over each byte `c` in the input vector `data`. Each byte is checked to ensure it adheres to the UTF-8 format.

#### Step 3: Handle the First Byte of a Character

```cpp
if(count == 0) {
    if((c >> 5) == 0b110) count = 1;  // 2-byte character
    else if ((c >> 4) == 0b1110) count = 2;  // 3-byte character
    else if ((c >> 3) == 0b11110) count = 3;  // 4-byte character
    else if (c >> 7) return false;  // Invalid starting byte
}
```

- If `count == 0`, we are starting a new character:
  - We check the first three bits of `c` using bitwise shifts (`c >> 5`, `c >> 4`, `c >> 3`).
  - If the first byte starts with `110` (binary), it indicates the beginning of a 2-byte character, so we set `count = 1` (expecting 1 continuation byte).
  - If the first byte starts with `1110`, it indicates a 3-byte character, so we set `count = 2`.
  - If the first byte starts with `11110`, it indicates a 4-byte character, so we set `count = 3`.
  - If the first byte does not match any of these valid patterns or starts with `0` (i.e., `c >> 7`), the sequence is invalid, and we return `false`.

#### Step 4: Handle Continuation Bytes

```cpp
else {
    if ((c >> 6) != 0b10) return false;  // Continuation byte should start with 10
    count--;
}
```

- If `count` is greater than 0, it means we're expecting a continuation byte. A continuation byte must start with the binary prefix `10` (i.e., its first two bits should be `10`).
- We use the bitwise operation `(c >> 6)` to check if the first two bits are `10`. If this condition is not met, we return `false` because the byte does not comply with the UTF-8 standard.
- After validating the continuation byte, we decrement `count` to track that one continuation byte has been successfully processed.

#### Step 5: Check for Unfinished Characters

```cpp
return count == 0;
```

- After processing all bytes, if `count` is 0, it means we have successfully processed all characters, and each character had the correct number of continuation bytes.
- If `count` is not 0, it means there was an incomplete character (e.g., a character started but did not have the required number of continuation bytes), so we return `false`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

- **Time complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of bytes in the input vector `data`. We iterate through the list of bytes once, performing constant-time bitwise operations for each byte. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear in the size of the input.

#### Space Complexity:

- **Space complexity**: `O(1)`. We only use a constant amount of extra space (`count`), which does not depend on the size of the input. Therefore, the space complexity is constant.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently verifies if a sequence of bytes represents valid UTF-8 encoding by using bitwise operations to check the structure of each byte and ensure that the number of continuation bytes is correct. The algorithm runs in linear time (`O(n)`) and uses constant space (`O(1)`), making it optimal for large inputs. The use of bitwise operations ensures that the solution is both time-efficient and easy to implement, allowing it to handle all valid and invalid UTF-8 sequences as specified by the standard.

By iterating through the byte sequence and verifying the first byte and subsequent continuation bytes, this solution accurately checks the validity of UTF-8 encoded data in a minimal and effective manner.
