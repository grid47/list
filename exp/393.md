### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers representing byte values, determine if the data represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. A valid UTF-8 encoding follows specific rules based on the leading bits of the byte sequences.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Count**: Use a counter to track how many additional bytes are expected for a multi-byte character.

2. **Iterate Through Bytes**: Loop through each byte in the `data` vector:
   - **Starting New Character**: If `count` is zero:
     - Check the first three bits to determine the number of bytes in the character:
       - If the byte starts with `110`, expect 1 additional byte (2 bytes total).
       - If it starts with `1110`, expect 2 additional bytes (3 bytes total).
       - If it starts with `11110`, expect 3 additional bytes (4 bytes total).
       - If it starts with `0`, it's a single-byte character; no additional bytes are expected.
       - If none of these conditions are met, return false (invalid leading byte).
   - **Continuation of Character**: If `count` is greater than zero:
     - Check if the byte starts with `10` (indicating a continuation byte). If not, return false.
     - Decrement the `count` since one continuation byte has been processed.

3. **Final Check**: After processing all bytes, check if `count` is zero. If it is, the encoding is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.

### Code Walk-through
- The solution employs bit manipulation to analyze the leading bits of each byte, determining if they conform to UTF-8 standards.
- By managing the `count` variable effectively, the algorithm ensures that the right number of continuation bytes are present for multi-byte characters.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of bytes in the input data, as each byte is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional data structures are used beyond a few integer variables.
