### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `amount` and an array of integers `coins`, where each integer represents a coin denomination. Your goal is to determine how many combinations of coins you can use to make up the given amount. You can use each coin denomination an unlimited number of times.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
   - Use a recursive function with memoization to keep track of the number of ways to make a specific amount using coins from a given index onward.
   - Define a 2D array `memo` where `memo[amnt][idx]` stores the number of ways to make `amnt` using coins starting from index `idx`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If all coins have been considered (`idx == nums.size()`), return 1 if `amnt` is zero (meaning a valid combination was found), or 0 otherwise.

3. **Recursion**:
   - For each coin at index `idx`, explore two scenarios:
     - **Exclude the current coin**: Recursively call the function to compute combinations without the current coin.
     - **Include the current coin**: If `amnt` is greater than or equal to the value of the coin, recursively call the function with the reduced amount (`amnt - nums[idx]`).

4. **Memoization**:
   - Store results in the `memo` array to avoid redundant calculations.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `change` function initializes the coin denominations and prepares the memoization array.

2. **Sorting Coins**:
   - Sort the coins in descending order to optimize the recursive calls (not strictly necessary but can help in some cases).

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - The `dp` function is defined to calculate the number of ways to make change for the specified amount.

4. **Return Result**:
   - The final result from the `dp` function is returned as the answer.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(amount * n), where `amount` is the target amount and `n` is the number of coin denominations. This accounts for the recursive calls and the memoization.
- **Space Complexity**: O(amount * n) for the `memo` array used for storing results.
