### Problem Statement

The problem involves determining the winner in a game based on a series of comparisons between elements in an array. Given an array of integers, we need to find the winning number after a sequence of comparisons defined by the following rules:

1. Start with the first element as the current winner.
2. Compare the current winner with the next element in the array.
3. If the next element is greater than the current winner, the next element becomes the new winner, and the comparison count resets.
4. If the next element is less than or equal to the current winner, the current winner remains the same, and the count of consecutive wins for the current winner increases.
5. If the current winner wins `k` consecutive comparisons, that winner is declared the overall winner.
6. If the loop completes and no one has won `k` consecutive comparisons, the last standing winner is declared the overall winner.

### Approach

To efficiently solve this problem, we will iterate through the array while maintaining a counter for consecutive wins. The strategy involves:

- Initializing the first element of the array as the current winner.
- Using a counter to track how many times the current winner has won consecutively against subsequent elements.
- As we iterate through the array, we check each element against the current winner:
  - If the next element is greater, we update the winner and reset the counter.
  - If the next element is less than or equal, we increment the counter.
- If the counter reaches `k`, we return the current winner immediately.
- If we reach the end of the array without any winner achieving `k` consecutive wins, we return the last known winner.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the provided code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getWinner(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.size(); // Get the size of the array
```
- We start by defining the class `Solution` and declaring the function `getWinner`, which takes in an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`.
- We retrieve the size of the array and store it in `n`.

```cpp
        int cnt = 0; // Counter for consecutive wins
        int j = 0; // Index of the current winner
```
- We initialize `cnt` to count how many times the current winner has won consecutively.
- We set `j` to the index of the current winner, initially starting with the first element at index `0`.

```cpp
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if(arr[i] < arr[j]) {
                cnt++; // Increment the win count for the current winner
            } else {
                cnt = 1; // Reset count and update the winner index
                j = i; // Update the winner to the current element
            }
```
- We iterate through the array starting from the second element (index `1`).
- If the current element is less than the current winner (`arr[j]`), we increment the win count for the current winner.
- If the current element is greater than the current winner, we reset the count to `1` (indicating the new winner has won) and update the winner's index to the current element's index.

```cpp
            if(cnt == k) return arr[j]; // Return the winner if it wins k times
        }
```
- After updating the counts, we check if the count of consecutive wins has reached `k`. If so, we return the current winner (`arr[j]`).

```cpp
        return arr[j]; // If no winner achieved k wins, return the last known winner
    }
};
```
- If we finish the loop and no element has reached `k` wins, we return the last known winner, which is the element at `arr[j]`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. We traverse the array once, making a constant amount of work for each element.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are using a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size (only a few integer variables are used).

### Conclusion

The solution to the problem efficiently determines the winner of the game based on the specified rules. By maintaining a simple count of consecutive wins and updating the current winner accordingly, we achieve an optimal solution.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Iterative Comparison**: The algorithm leverages an iterative approach to handle comparisons and updates in a single pass through the array.
- **Early Exit**: The early return mechanism allows for quick results as soon as a winner achieves the required number of consecutive wins.
- **Simplicity and Efficiency**: The overall simplicity of the approach, combined with its efficiency, makes it a suitable solution for problems involving sequential comparisons in arrays.

This method serves as an excellent example of applying straightforward logic to solve a competitive programming problem, showcasing the ability to track and compare values efficiently within a linear time frame.
