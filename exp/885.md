### Problem Statement
Given a grid of dimensions `rows x cols` and a starting position `(rStart, cStart)`, you need to return all the coordinates of the cells in the grid in a spiral order starting from the given position.

### Approach
The solution uses a simulation of the spiral traversal:

1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a result vector with the starting coordinates. Define movement directions (`dx`, `dy`) to control the spiral traversal.

2. **Spiral Expansion**:
   - Use a loop that expands the spiral outward. The length of each directional movement is determined by the current layer of the spiral (`n`).
   - For each layer:
     - Move in the current direction for `n / 2 + 1` steps, updating the current position `(rStart, cStart)`.
     - After moving, check if the new position is within the bounds of the grid. If it is, add it to the result.
   - After completing the moves in one direction, update the movement direction to simulate a turn in the spiral (using a clockwise rotation).

3. **Termination**: The process continues until the size of the result matches the total number of cells in the grid.

### Code Walk-through
- Start from the initial position and direction.
- Continue moving in the current direction until the spiral expands sufficiently.
- Rotate the direction after completing a full sweep of the current layer.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(rows \times cols) \), as you visit each cell exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(rows \times cols) \), to store the coordinates of each cell.
