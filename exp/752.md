### Problem Statement
You are given a lock with four wheels, each displaying a digit from `0` to `9`. The lock starts at `0000`, and your goal is to reach a target configuration by turning the wheels. Some configurations are "dead ends" and cannot be reached. The task is to determine the minimum number of turns required to reach the target configuration from the starting configuration, avoiding any dead ends.

### Approach
1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use an `unordered_set` to store the dead-end configurations for quick lookups.
   - Use a `queue` for BFS (Breadth-First Search) to explore all possible configurations starting from `0000`.

2. **BFS Initialization**:
   - If `0000` is a dead end, return `-1`.
   - Initialize the queue with the starting configuration `0000`.

3. **BFS Execution**:
   - For each turn, process all configurations currently in the queue.
   - If the current configuration matches the target, return the number of turns taken.
   - Generate all possible neighboring configurations by turning each wheel up or down.
   - Skip dead-end configurations, mark valid neighbors as visited (by inserting into the dead set), and add them to the queue.

4. **Return Result**:
   - If the queue is empty and the target hasn't been reached, return `-1`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains methods to solve the lock problem.

- **Method**:
  - `int openLock(vector<string>& deadends, string target)`: Implements the BFS logic to find the minimum number of turns to reach the target.

- **Helper Method**:
  - `vector<string> neighbours(const string &code)`: Generates all valid neighboring configurations by turning each wheel one step up or down.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as there are a limited number of configurations (10,000 possible combinations).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the BFS queue and the dead set, considering the constant size of the lock configuration space.
