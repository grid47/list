### Problem Statement
You are given an array `nums` of 4 numbers, and you need to determine if you can use each of the numbers exactly once along with the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to compute the value 24. The order of operations follows the standard precedence rules.

### Approach
The approach involves generating all permutations of the input numbers and evaluating every combination of arithmetic operations to see if any yields the value 24. The steps are as follows:

1. **Sort the Numbers**: Start by sorting the input numbers to ensure that all permutations are considered in a systematic way.
  
2. **Generate Permutations**: Use `next_permutation` to generate all possible orders of the numbers.

3. **Evaluate Each Combination**: For each permutation of numbers, evaluate all possible combinations of operations. The evaluation is done recursively to check various groupings and operations of the numbers.

4. **Check Validity**: A helper function recursively checks if it's possible to achieve the target value (24) using the provided numbers and operations.

### Code Walk-through
- The `judgePoint24` function generates all permutations of the input numbers and checks each permutation for validity using the `valid` function.
- The `valid` function performs the arithmetic operations and recursively checks whether combining the current numbers can lead to the target value.
- The base `valid` function checks if the final result is close to 24 using a small epsilon (0.001) for floating-point precision.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n!), where n is the number of numbers (4 in this case), due to the generation of permutations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for recursion and storing intermediate results during evaluations.

This method is efficient given that the size of the input is fixed (only 4 numbers), making exhaustive searching feasible.
