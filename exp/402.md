### Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer represented as a string `num`, remove `k` digits from the number to create the smallest possible number. The resulting number must not have leading zeros and should be returned as a string. If removing `k` digits results in an empty string, return "0".

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: Create an empty string `ans` to build the resulting number. If the length of `num` is less than or equal to `k`, return "0".
2. **Iterate through digits**: For each character `c` in `num`:
   - While `ans` is not empty, the last character in `ans` is greater than `c`, and there are still digits to remove (`k`), pop the last character from `ans`.
   - If `ans` is not empty or `c` is not '0', add `c` to `ans`.
3. **Finalize the result**: After processing all characters, if there are still digits to remove, pop from `ans`. If `ans` is empty, return "0".
4. **Construct the result**: Reverse the order of `ans` to get the final number and return it as a substring of `num` starting from index `n` (where `n` is the original length of `num`).

### Code Walk-through
1. **Edge Case**: If `num`'s size is less than or equal to `k`, return "0".
2. **Loop through digits**: Use a for loop to iterate through each digit:
   - If conditions are met (last digit in `ans` is larger than `c` and `k` is still available), remove the last digit from `ans`.
   - Push `c` into `ans` unless it results in leading zeros.
3. **Post-loop processing**: Remove any remaining digits from `ans` if `k` is still greater than 0.
4. **Return the result**: Check if `ans` is empty; if so, return "0". Otherwise, extract and return the final number from `num`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `num`. Each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the storage of the resulting string `ans`.
