### Problem Statement

The problem asks to determine how to distribute a given number of money (denoted as `num`) among a specified number of kids (denoted as `kid`) such that each child gets as much as possible under certain constraints. The distribution must follow specific rules to maximize fairness while avoiding giving certain amounts.

The main goal is to calculate how many kids receive exactly 8 units, and then handle any remaining units optimally. The rules for distribution depend on whether the average amount each child should receive is above 8, 4, or below 4, and whether there is a remainder when dividing the money among the kids.

### Approach

The approach to solving the problem involves calculating how many full amounts of money each child can receive, then adjusting based on remainders and specific constraints to ensure fairness. The solution requires multiple conditional checks to ensure the correct allocation.

Here is a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Check for Impossible Distribution**:
   - If the total money `num` is less than the number of kids `kid`, it's impossible to distribute the money at all, and the function should return -1.

2. **Calculate the Average Distribution**:
   - Divide the total money `num` by the number of kids `kid` to calculate the average amount each child would receive if the money were distributed evenly. Based on this, decide how to allocate the money in the following steps.

3. **Handle the Case where the Average is Greater than 8**:
   - If each child would receive more than 8 units (i.e., `avg > 8`), then the maximum number of kids that can receive 8 units each is `kid - 1`, because one child would receive the remaining amount.

4. **Handle the Case where the Average is Exactly 8**:
   - If the average amount per child is exactly 8, further checks are required. If the total money can be evenly divided by the number of kids, then all kids receive exactly 8 units. Otherwise, one less kid receives 8 units.

5. **Handle the Case where the Average is Between 5 and 8**:
   - If the average is between 4 and 8, we need to check how many kids can receive the maximum possible amount of 7 units each, and account for any remainder money left.

6. **Handle the Case where the Average is Exactly 4**:
   - If the average is exactly 4, similar checks are performed, but in this case, the remaining money is handled in a specific way by looking at the remainder of money when dividing by 7.

7. **Handle the Case where the Average is Less than 4**:
   - If the average is less than 4, we still need to handle how the money can be distributed optimally, ensuring that as many kids as possible receive 7 units each, with adjustments made based on the remainder.

### Code Breakdown

1. **Initial Check for Impossibility**:
   ```cpp
   if(num < kid) return -1;
   ```
   - The first condition checks if the total amount of money is less than the number of kids. If so, it is impossible to distribute the money, so the function immediately returns `-1`.

2. **Calculate Average Distribution**:
   ```cpp
   int avg = num / kid;
   ```
   - We calculate the average amount each kid should receive by dividing the total amount of money by the number of kids.

3. **Handle Case Where Average is Greater than 8**:
   ```cpp
   if(avg > 8) return kid - 1;
   ```
   - If the average exceeds 8, the maximum number of kids who can receive 8 units each is `kid - 1`. Therefore, the function returns `kid - 1`.

4. **Handle Case Where Average is Exactly 8**:
   ```cpp
   if(avg == 8) {
       if(num % kid == 0) return kid;
       return kid - 1;
   }
   ```
   - If the average is exactly 8, we check if the total money can be evenly divided among the kids. If `num % kid == 0`, all kids can receive 8 units, so we return `kid`. Otherwise, we return `kid - 1` because one kid would not receive exactly 8 units.

5. **Handle Case Where Average is Between 5 and 8**:
   ```cpp
   if(avg > 4) {
       num -= kid;
       int sol = num / 7;
       if(num % 7 == 3 && sol == kid - 1) sol--;
       return sol;
   }
   ```
   - If the average is between 4 and 8, we first reduce the total amount of money by the number of kids (as each kid gets at least 1 unit). Then, we calculate how many kids can receive 7 units each (`num / 7`). We handle the special case where the remainder is 3 and the number of kids is one less than the total (`sol == kid - 1`), in which case we subtract 1 from the solution.

6. **Handle Case Where Average is Exactly 4**:
   ```cpp
   if(avg == 4) {
       num -= kid;
       int sol = num / 7;
       if(num % 7 == 3 && sol == kid - 1) sol--;
       return sol;
   }
   ```
   - If the average is exactly 4, we again reduce the total amount of money by the number of kids. Then, we check how many kids can receive 7 units each. We account for the special case where the remainder is 3 and the number of kids is `kid - 1`, and adjust the solution accordingly.

7. **Handle Case Where Average is Less Than 4**:
   ```cpp
   if(avg < 4) {
       num -= kid;
       int sol = num / 7;
       if(num % 7 == 3 && sol == kid - 1) sol--;
       return sol;
   }
   ```
   - If the average is less than 4, we perform the same steps as in the previous cases, reducing the total amount of money by the number of kids and then calculating how many kids can receive 7 units each.

8. **Return -1 if No Other Condition is Met**:
   ```cpp
   return -1;
   ```
   - If none of the conditions above were satisfied, return `-1` indicating an invalid scenario.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - The function consists of only a few constant-time operations: basic arithmetic operations, comparisons, and modulus calculations. Since there are no loops or recursive calls, the time complexity is constant.

### Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - The space complexity is constant, as the function only uses a few integer variables to store intermediate results. There is no use of additional data structures or recursive calls.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Input:
```cpp
int num = 100, kid = 7;
```

- **Step 1**: Calculate average:
  - `avg = num / kid = 100 / 7 = 14`.

- **Step 2**: Check if average is greater than 8:
  - Since `avg > 8`, the function returns `kid - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6`.

#### Output:
```cpp
6
```

### Conclusion

The `distMoney` function provides a highly efficient solution for distributing money among kids, based on a series of checks for various ranges of average money per kid. By sorting out the cases where the average amount is greater than 8, exactly 8, between 4 and 8, or less than 4, the solution ensures that the distribution is as fair as possible under the given constraints. The function runs in constant time and uses constant space, making it optimal for this problem.
