### Problem Statement

The problem asks to compute the maximum achievable value of `x` after performing a set number of operations on an integer `num`. The operations consist of adding `2` to `num` for a total of `t` times. Your goal is to return the final value of `num` after performing these operations.

The challenge is to compute the result of this transformation, given the initial value of `num` and the number of allowed operations `t`.

### Approach

This problem is very straightforward, as it boils down to simple arithmetic. The problem's approach involves adding a value of `2` to the integer `num`, `t` times. Each operation adds `2`, so the total increase in `num` will be `2 * t`.

### Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Let's break down the code to understand the operations:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int theMaximumAchievableX(int num, int t) {
        return num + 2 * t;
    }
};
```

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `theMaximumAchievableX` is defined to accept two arguments: `num` and `t`. 
     - `num` is the starting integer.
     - `t` is the number of operations to perform.
   
2. **Arithmetic Operation:**
   - The core of the function is the expression `num + 2 * t`. This computes the maximum achievable value of `x` after performing `t` operations.
     - For each operation, we add `2` to the value of `num`. Thus, after `t` operations, the value of `num` will have increased by `2 * t`.
   
3. **Return Statement:**
   - The result is directly returned by the function. This is the final value of `num` after adding `2 * t` to it.

Since the operations and computations are straightforward and involve only a single arithmetic operation, the code executes efficiently with a constant time complexity.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is constant, i.e., \( O(1) \). This is because the function only performs a simple arithmetic calculation (`num + 2 * t`), and there are no loops or recursive calls involved. The operation takes the same amount of time regardless of the values of `num` or `t`.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is also constant, i.e., \( O(1) \). The function uses a fixed amount of memory to store the input arguments (`num` and `t`) and the result. No additional data structures (such as arrays, lists, or hash maps) are used, so the space used by the function does not scale with the size of the inputs.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the maximum achievable value of `x` after applying the allowed operations. The time and space complexities are both \( O(1) \), making it an optimal solution for this problem.

The problem itself is straightforward, requiring just the addition of `2 * t` to the initial number. There are no complex loops, recursive calls, or additional data structures needed, making this an elegant and simple solution for the task at hand.

This solution is ideal for situations where the problem involves a fixed number of operations that can be computed directly via arithmetic. Since the logic is simple and executes in constant time, it is well-suited for competitive programming, coding interviews, and applications that need to process large numbers of test cases efficiently.
