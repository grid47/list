### Problem Statement
Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Carry**: Start with a carry variable initialized to 0.
2. **Process Bits**: Loop through both strings until both are empty and there is no carry left.
   - If there are remaining bits in string `a`, add the last bit to the carry and remove it from `a`.
   - If there are remaining bits in string `b`, add the last bit to the carry and remove it from `b`.
3. **Calculate Result Bit**: The result bit is determined by `carry % 2`, which gives the current bit of the binary sum.
4. **Update Carry**: Update the carry for the next iteration by dividing it by 2 (`carry /= 2`).
5. **Build Result**: Prepend the calculated result bit to the result string.
6. **Return Result**: Once the loop ends, return the resulting binary string.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty result string and a carry of 0.
2. **Loop**: Use a while loop that continues until both input strings are empty and there is no carry left.
3. **Extract Bits**: Inside the loop, check if each string is non-empty. If so, convert the last character to an integer and add it to the carry, then pop the last character.
4. **Compute Result**: Calculate the result bit using `carry % 2` and prepend it to the result string.
5. **Update Carry**: Adjust the carry for the next iteration by performing integer division by 2.
6. **Final Output**: Return the accumulated result string.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(\max(L_1, L_2)) \), where \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) are the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b`, as we may need to iterate through all bits.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(L) \), where \( L \) is the length of the resulting binary string, which in the worst case could be one bit longer than the longest input string.
