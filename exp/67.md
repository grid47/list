### Problem Statement

The task is to add two binary strings, `a` and `b`, and return their sum as a binary string. In binary addition, `1 + 1` results in `10`, carrying `1` to the next bit position. This problem requires managing the binary addition of digits from the two strings, taking care of carry values between bit positions.

### Approach

The solution performs binary addition by working from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost) in each string. This approach ensures that all bits are added accurately with the correct carry. The algorithm maintains a carry (`cr`) initialized to zero and iterates through both strings until all bits are processed and thereâ€™s no carry left. The resulting binary string is built by appending each computed binary digit at the start of a result string.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   ```cpp
   int cr = 0;
   string res = "";
   ```
   - `cr` (carry) is set to 0, representing the initial carry for binary addition.
   - `res` is an empty string to accumulate the binary result.

2. **Loop Until Both Strings Are Exhausted and No Carry Left**:
   ```cpp
   while(!a.empty() || !b.empty() || cr) {
   ```
   - Continues until both strings are empty and there is no carry left.
   - This ensures that all bits and any remaining carry are fully processed.

3. **Extract and Add Bits from the End of Each String**:
   ```cpp
   if(!a.empty()) {
       cr += a.back() - '0';
       a.pop_back();
   }
   if(!b.empty()) {
       cr += b.back() - '0';
       b.pop_back();
   }
   ```
   - If `a` is not empty, extracts the last character (rightmost bit), converts it to an integer, and adds it to `cr`.
   - If `b` is not empty, does the same for `b`.
   - The use of `pop_back()` removes the processed bit from the string, making it shorter for the next iteration.

4. **Calculate the Current Bit and Update Carry**:
   ```cpp
   res = to_string(cr % 2) + res;
   cr /= 2;
   ```
   - Calculates the current bit by taking `cr % 2` and appends this to the beginning of `res`.
   - Updates `cr` by integer division (`cr /= 2`), which sets it to 0 if no carry is left or to 1 if the result of the addition generated a carry.

5. **Return the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```
   - Returns the completed binary addition result as a string.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity
- **O(max(m, n))**: The algorithm processes each bit in both strings, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of strings `a` and `b`.

#### Space Complexity
- **O(max(m, n))**: The space needed for the result string `res` is proportional to the length of the longer input string plus one for potential carry.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently handles binary addition with carry management by iterating through each bit from right to left. It combines both strings bit-by-bit, ensuring accurate calculation with minimal space overhead. The approach is optimal for binary addition, providing a solution that scales well with input size, and produces a correctly formatted binary output string even for cases where one string is significantly longer than the other. This code exemplifies efficient handling of bit manipulation and carry propagation in binary arithmetic.
