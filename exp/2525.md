### Problem Statement

The problem requires categorizing a box based on its dimensions and mass. We need to determine whether the box is classified as "Bulky," "Heavy," "Both," or "Neither." 

The classification is determined by the following conditions:
- **Bulky**: The box is considered bulky if any of its dimensions (length, width, or height) is at least 10,000 units, or if its volume exceeds 1 billion cubic units.
- **Heavy**: The box is considered heavy if its mass is at least 100 units.
- **Both**: The box is categorized as both bulky and heavy if it satisfies both the conditions for bulky and heavy.
- **Neither**: If the box does not satisfy either the condition for being bulky or heavy, it is categorized as neither.

The input to the function consists of the dimensions (length, width, height) of the box, along with its mass. The function needs to return the appropriate category as a string.

### Approach

1. **Initial Setup**:
   We first define two boolean variables, `bulky` and `heavy`, which will be used to store whether the box is considered bulky or heavy based on the given conditions.

2. **Determine if the Box is Bulky**:
   To check if the box is bulky, we calculate the volume of the box by multiplying its length, width, and height. If any of the dimensions (length, width, or height) is greater than or equal to 10,000 or the volume exceeds 1 billion (1,000,000,000), we set the `bulky` flag to true.

3. **Determine if the Box is Heavy**:
   To check if the box is heavy, we compare its mass with 100. If the mass is greater than or equal to 100, we set the `heavy` flag to true.

4. **Categorize the Box**:
   Using the `bulky` and `heavy` flags, we classify the box into one of four categories:
   - If both flags are true, the box is classified as "Both."
   - If neither flag is true, the box is classified as "Neither."
   - If only the `bulky` flag is true, the box is classified as "Bulky."
   - If only the `heavy` flag is true, the box is classified as "Heavy."

5. **Return the Result**:
   Finally, the function returns the appropriate category based on the values of `bulky` and `heavy`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. Function Definition

```cpp
public:
    string categorizeBox(int length, int width, int height, int mass) {
```

- The function `categorizeBox` is defined to take four integers as inputs: `length`, `width`, `height`, and `mass`. These represent the dimensions and mass of the box.

#### 2. Initialize the Flags

```cpp
    bool bulky = false, heavy = false;
```

- Two boolean flags, `bulky` and `heavy`, are initialized to `false`. These flags will be used to track whether the box meets the criteria for being bulky or heavy.

#### 3. Calculate Volume and Check for Bulky

```cpp
    double v = (double) length * width * height;
    if(length >= 10000 || width >= 10000 || 
       height >= 10000 || v >= 1000000000)
        bulky = true;
```

- We calculate the volume `v` of the box by multiplying its `length`, `width`, and `height`. Since the volume can be a large number, it is cast to a `double` to avoid overflow.
- We then check if any of the dimensions is greater than or equal to 10,000 or if the volume exceeds 1 billion (1,000,000,000). If any of these conditions are met, we set the `bulky` flag to `true`.

#### 4. Check for Heavy

```cpp
    if(mass >= 100)
        heavy = true;
```

- We check if the mass of the box is greater than or equal to 100. If this condition is true, we set the `heavy` flag to `true`.

#### 5. Determine the Category

```cpp
    string category;
    if(bulky && heavy)
        category = "Both";
    else if (!bulky && !heavy)
        category = "Neither";
    else if (bulky)
        category = "Bulky";
    else if (heavy)
        category = "Heavy";
```

- We use a series of `if-else` conditions to determine the category of the box based on the values of the `bulky` and `heavy` flags.
  - If both flags are `true`, the box is classified as "Both."
  - If neither flag is `true`, the box is classified as "Neither."
  - If only the `bulky` flag is `true`, the box is classified as "Bulky."
  - If only the `heavy` flag is `true`, the box is classified as "Heavy."

#### 6. Return the Result

```cpp
    return category;
}
```

- Finally, the function returns the `category` string, which holds the classification of the box.

### Time Complexity

- **Volume Calculation**: The volume calculation involves a simple multiplication of three integers (`length`, `width`, and `height`), which takes constant time, i.e., \( O(1) \).
  
- **Comparison Operations**: Each comparison operation (e.g., checking if the dimensions exceed 10,000 or if the volume exceeds 1 billion) is a constant-time operation, i.e., \( O(1) \).

- **Overall Complexity**: Since all operations in the function involve only constant-time operations, the overall time complexity is \( O(1) \), meaning the function runs in constant time regardless of the input values.

### Space Complexity

- **Space Usage**: The function uses only a few integer variables (`bulky`, `heavy`, `v`, `category`), and no large data structures are created. Therefore, the space complexity is \( O(1) \), indicating constant space usage.

### Conclusion

This solution is highly efficient, with constant time and space complexity. The logic is straightforward: by checking the dimensions and mass of the box, we can quickly determine its category. The use of boolean flags for `bulky` and `heavy` simplifies the categorization process. This approach ensures that the function runs in optimal time, regardless of the size or specific values of the input.
