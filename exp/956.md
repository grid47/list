### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers representing the lengths of rods, the goal is to form two billboards of equal height by balancing the rods, maximizing the height of the billboards.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
   - The function uses recursion and memoization to efficiently calculate the maximum height of the billboards.
   - It tracks the index of the current rod and the difference in height between the two sides of the billboard.

2. **Recursive Function** (`dp`):
   - **Base Case**: 
     - If all rods are considered (`idx == rods.size()`), return 0 if the height difference is zero; otherwise, return `INT_MIN` (indicating an impossible state).
   - **Memoization Check**:
     - If the result for the current `idx` and `diff` is already computed, return that result.
   - **Recursion**:
     - The recursive function explores three possibilities:
       1. **Skip the current rod**: Call `dp(idx + 1, diff)`.
       2. **Add the current rod to the first billboard**: Call `dp(idx + 1, diff + rods[idx])` and add the current rod's length to the result.
       3. **Add the current rod to the second billboard**: Call `dp(idx + 1, abs(diff - rods[idx]))` and calculate the new height difference.
   - The maximum of these three values is stored in the memoization table for the current `idx` and `diff`.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The initial call to `dp` starts with the first rod and a difference of zero. The result is the maximum height of the balanced billboards.

### Code Walk-through
- The class maintains a vector of rods and a memoization structure to store intermediate results.
- The `tallestBillboard` function initializes the data structures and calls the recursive `dp` function.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * d), where `n` is the number of rods and `d` is the maximum possible difference in height. The function processes each rod and each possible height difference.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * d) for the memoization table used to store results of subproblems.
