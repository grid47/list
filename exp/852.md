### Problem Statement
You are given an array that represents a mountain, meaning it is strictly increasing up to a peak and then strictly decreasing. Your task is to find the index of the peak element in the mountain array.

### Approach
1. **Binary Search**:
   - Since the mountain array has a unique peak, we can efficiently find the peak using a binary search approach.
   - Initialize two pointers: `l` (left) starting at index 1 and `r` (right) starting at `n - 2`, where `n` is the size of the array. This avoids the boundaries, ensuring we can always access `arr[mid - 1]` and `arr[mid + 1]`.

2. **Midpoint Evaluation**:
   - Calculate the middle index `mid` using the formula `l + (r - l + 1) / 2`. The addition of 1 ensures that we favor the upper half in case of a tie.
   - Check if `arr[mid]` is greater than both `arr[mid - 1]` and `arr[mid + 1]`. If it is, we have found the peak, so return `mid`.

3. **Adjust Search Range**:
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than `arr[mid + 1]`, it means we are in the descending part of the array. Update `r` to `mid - 1` to search the left side.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than `arr[mid - 1]`, it means we are in the ascending part. Update `l` to `mid + 1` to search the right side.

4. **Continue Until Found**:
   - Repeat the process until the peak is found. The search space will narrow down to the peak.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log N), where N is the number of elements in the array due to the binary search.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space proportional to input size is used.
