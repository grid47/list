### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the kth largest element in the array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

### Approach
1. **Use of Priority Queue**: A max-heap (priority queue) can be utilized to efficiently retrieve the largest elements.
   
2. **Process**:
   - Insert all elements of the array into the priority queue.
   - Pop the top element from the queue `k` times. The top element after the k pops will be the kth largest element.

### Code Walk-through
- **findKthLargest**: The main function that finds the kth largest element:
  - Iterate through each element in `nums` and push it into the priority queue.
  - Pop the top element from the priority queue `k` times.
  - After popping `k` elements, the top of the queue will be the kth largest element.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n + k \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. The initial insertion of all elements into the priority queue takes \(O(n \log n)\), and popping \(k\) elements takes \(O(k \log n)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for storing the elements in the priority queue.
