### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` representing a message encoded as digits. Each digit can represent a letter ('1' -> 'A', '2' -> 'B', ..., '26' -> 'Z'). The string may also contain the wildcard character '*', which can represent any digit from '1' to '9' or '10' to '26' when paired with another digit. The goal is to determine the total number of ways to decode the given string.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
   - Use an array (`memo`) to cache the results for specific indices in the string to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The function `numDecodings` initializes the memoization array and calls a helper function `ways`.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - The function `ways(int i, string &s)` calculates the number of ways to decode the substring starting from index `i`.
   - Base case: If `i` reaches the end of the string, return 1 (indicating a valid decoding).
   - If the character at `i` is '0', return 0 (no valid decoding).
   - If the value is already cached, return it.

3. **Handling Wildcards and Decodings**:
   - For the character at `i`, if it's a '*', consider all valid single digits (1-9) and possible two-digit combinations with the next character.
   - If it's '1' or '2', check for valid two-digit combinations with the next character (considering both digits and wildcards).
   - Update the result based on the number of ways obtained from recursive calls, ensuring to apply modulo `10^9 + 7` to prevent overflow.

4. **Return Result**:
   - The total number of decoding ways is returned after processing the entire string.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: The memoization array is initialized to -1, and the decoding process begins.
2. **Base Cases**: Check for valid characters and end of the string.
3. **Recursive Exploration**: The recursive function explores possible decodings, caching results for efficiency.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Ensure results are within the specified limits.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since each index is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the memoization array that stores intermediate results.
