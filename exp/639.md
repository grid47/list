### Problem Statement

In this problem, we are tasked with decoding a string `s` where each character represents an encoded message. The message can consist of numeric characters (1-9) or wildcard characters (`*`). The goal is to determine how many ways the string `s` can be decoded into valid sequences. 

For example, if the string is `"12"`, it can be decoded as:
- `"AB"` (where 1 = A and 2 = B)

If the string is `"1*"` or `"*2"`, it can be decoded in multiple ways because the wildcard `*` can represent any digit from 1 to 9. The challenge involves counting the number of possible decodings for a given input string considering such wildcard behavior.

### Approach

The key to solving this problem is dynamic programming. We'll use memoization to optimize our recursive solution and avoid recomputation of subproblems. Here’s the approach:

1. **Recursive Decomposition**: 
   - Start from the first index and recursively check if the current character can be decoded (either as a single digit or two digits). 
   - For `*`, the possible digit representations are all numbers from 1 to 9.
   - For digits `1` and `2`, we can check if they form valid two-digit numbers (i.e., `10-19` for `1` and `20-26` for `2`).
   
2. **Memoization**: 
   - We maintain an array `memo[]` where each element stores the number of ways to decode the substring starting from that index. If the value is already computed, we return it to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Wildcard Handling**:
   - The wildcard `*` can represent any digit from `1` to `9` and thus requires special handling in the recursive step.

4. **Base Case**:
   - If we’ve reached the end of the string, it represents a valid decoding (1 way to decode).
   - If we encounter a `0` or invalid encoding, return 0.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let’s break down the solution and explain each part in detail.

#### 1. **Class Definition and Initialization**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> memo;
    int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
```
- `memo`: This vector stores the number of decodings for each substring starting at index `i`.
- `mod`: This constant ensures that the result fits within the bounds of a typical 32-bit integer, as the number of ways to decode can be large.

#### 2. **Main Function**
```cpp
    int numDecodings(string s) {
        memo.resize(s.size(), -1);
        return !s.size() ? 0 : ways(0, s);
    }
```
- The function `numDecodings` initializes the memoization array and starts the recursive calculation from index `0`. 
- If the string is empty (`!s.size()`), return `0` since there are no valid decodings.

#### 3. **Recursive Function `ways`**
```cpp
    long long ways(int i, string &s) {
        if(i >= s.size()) return 1;
        if(s[i] == '0') return memo[i] = 0; // no valid decoding for '0'
        
        if(memo[i] != -1) return memo[i];
        
        long long res = ways(i + 1, s);
```
- `ways(i, s)` is a recursive function that calculates the number of valid decodings starting at index `i`.
- If `i >= s.size()`, we’ve reached the end of the string, and we return 1 because the empty string can always be decoded in one way.
- If the character at `i` is `'0'`, it is invalid since no letter can be decoded from `'0'`, so return `0`.
- If the result for this index has already been computed (`memo[i] != -1`), return the stored result to avoid redundant calculations.
- `res` starts by assuming the current position `i` contributes one way to decode (the single-character decoding).

#### 4. **Handling `*` (Wildcard)**
```cpp
        if(s[i] == '*') {
            res *= 9; // 9 possible digits for '*'
            
            if(i < s.size() - 1 && s[i + 1] >= '0' && s[i+1] <= '9') {
                res += ways(i + 2, s);
            }
            
            if(i < s.size() - 1 && s[i + 1] == '*') {
                res += 9 * ways(i + 2, s);
            }
            
            if(i < s.size() - 1 && s[i + 1] >= '0' && s[i+1] <= '6') {
                res += ways(i + 2, s);
            }
            
            if(i < s.size() - 1 && s[i + 1] == '*') {
                res += 6 * ways(i + 2, s);
            }            
        }
```
- If the current character is `*`, we multiply the result by `9` because `*` can represent any digit from `1` to `9`.
- We then check for possible valid two-character decodings starting at index `i`. For example, if the next character is a digit between `0` and `9`, we recursively calculate the number of ways to decode the substring starting at `i + 2`.
- Similarly, for `*` followed by another `*`, we handle it as 9 options (digits 1 to 9 for the first `*` and digits 1 to 6 for a valid two-digit number).

#### 5. **Handling `1` and `2`**
```cpp
        else if(s[i] == '1' && i < s.size() - 1) {
            if(s[i+1] >= '0' && s[i+1] <= '9')
                res += ways(i + 2, s);
            
            if(s[i+1] == '*')
                res += 9 * ways(i + 2, s);
        } else if(s[i] == '2' && i < s.size() - 1) {
            if(s[i+1] >= '0' && s[i+1] <= '6')
                res += ways(i + 2, s);
            
            if(s[i+1] == '*')
                res += 6 * ways(i + 2, s);
        }
```
- If the character at index `i` is `1`, we check if the next character is a valid digit between `0` and `9`. If so, we recursively calculate the number of ways to decode the substring starting at `i + 2`.
- If the next character is a `*`, it can represent any digit, so we multiply the result by `9` and recursively calculate the number of ways.
- Similarly, for the character `2`, the next character must be between `0` and `6` for valid two-digit decodings (i.e., `20-26`).

#### 6. **Modulo Operation**
```cpp
        res = res % mod;
        return memo[i] = res;
    }
```
- The result for each position is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to ensure that the result fits within the 32-bit integer range.
- The result is stored in `memo[i]` so that it can be reused if needed.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string. The recursion visits each index of the string once, and the memoization ensures that each index is only processed once.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)** for the memoization array `memo[]`, which stores the results for each index in the string.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently calculates the number of ways to decode a given string `s` using dynamic programming and memoization. It handles the special cases of wildcard characters (`*`) and ensures that the solution is computed optimally by avoiding redundant calculations. With its modular arithmetic, the solution is both time-efficient and space-efficient, making it suitable for larger input sizes.
