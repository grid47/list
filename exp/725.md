### Problem Statement
Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer `k`, split the linked list into `k` consecutive parts. The length of each part should be as equal as possible. The parts should be returned as an array of ListNode pointers. If the linked list has fewer nodes than `k`, some parts should be `NULL`.

### Approach
1. **Calculate Length**:
   - Traverse the linked list to determine its total length `len`.

2. **Determine Size of Each Part**:
   - Calculate the number of nodes in each part as `numNodes = len / k`.
   - Calculate the number of extra nodes as `ext = len % k`.

3. **Split the List**:
   - Iterate through the linked list:
     - For each part, store the starting node in the result vector.
     - Traverse `numNodes` times to find the end of the current part.
     - If there are remaining extra nodes (`ext > 0`), include one more node in the current part and decrement `ext`.
     - Disconnect the current part from the rest of the list by setting the `next` pointer to `NULL`.

4. **Handle Insufficient Nodes**:
   - If the total length of the linked list is less than `k`, fill the remaining parts with `NULL`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function**:
  - `vector<ListNode*> splitListToParts(ListNode* head, int k)`: Splits the linked list into `k` parts.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list, since we traverse the list to calculate its length and then again to split it.
- **Space Complexity**: O(K), where K is the number of parts, as we store the parts in a vector.
