### Problem Statement
Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be \(O(\log(\min(m, n)))\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are the lengths of the two arrays.

### Approach
Use a binary search technique to partition both arrays into two halves such that the maximum of the left halves is less than or equal to the minimum of the right halves. This allows us to find the median directly.

### Code Walk-through
1. Determine the sizes of `nums1` and `nums2`. Assign the smaller array to `A` and the larger one to `B` to minimize the binary search range.
2. Initialize pointers `imin`, `imax`, and variables `i` and `j` to represent the partition indices.
3. Perform binary search:
   - Calculate the partition index `i` for array `A` and `j` for array `B`.
   - Adjust `imin` and `imax` based on the comparison of elements around the partitions:
     - If `B[j - 1] > A[i]`, move `imin` up to `i + 1`.
     - If `A[i - 1] > B[j]`, move `imax` down to `i - 1`.
   - If the correct partition is found:
     - Calculate `lmax`, the maximum of the left partitions.
     - If the combined length of the arrays is odd, return `lmax` as the median.
     - If even, calculate `rmin`, the minimum of the right partitions, and return the average of `lmax` and `rmin`.
4. Return 0 if no median is found (should not reach here if inputs are valid).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(\log(\min(m, n)))\) - due to the binary search on the smaller array.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) - no additional space is used beyond a few variables.
