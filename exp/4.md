### üìå **Median of Two Sorted Arrays**

This problem challenges us to find the median of two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` without explicitly merging them. For a sorted array, the median is the middle value if it has an odd length or the average of the two middle values if it has an even length.

### üéØ **Objective**: Solve in **O(log(min(m, n)))** Time Complexity

Using binary search on the smaller array lets us find the median efficiently, instead of merging, which would take **O(m + n)** time.

### üí° **Key Insight**

By dividing both arrays into left and right partitions:
- The left partition holds the smaller half of all elements.
- The right partition holds the larger half.

If this partitioning is done correctly:
- For an odd-length combined array, the median is the largest element in the left partition.
- For an even-length combined array, the median is the average of the largest element in the left partition and the smallest element in the right partition.

### üöÄ **Approach**

1. **Identify the Smaller Array**:
   - Start by ensuring the binary search is performed on the smaller array, reducing iterations.

2. **Binary Search Partitioning**:
   - Partition the smaller array with binary search to find an index `i` in `A` and compute the corresponding partition index `j` in `B`.
   - The partition indices are chosen to balance the left and right sides of both arrays.

3. **Check Partition Validity**:
   - At each binary search step, verify if the partition is valid by checking whether the largest element on the left side is less than or equal to the smallest element on the right.
   - If not, adjust the binary search range and recheck until a valid partition is found.

4. **Median Calculation**:
   - If the combined length is odd, return the largest element in the left partition.
   - If even, return the average of the largest element on the left and the smallest element on the right.

### ‚úèÔ∏è **Code Breakdown**

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

```cpp
int m = nums1.size();
int n = nums2.size();

vector<int> A = (m < n) ? nums1 : nums2;
vector<int> B = (m < n) ? nums2 : nums1;
m = (nums1.size() < nums2.size()) ? nums1.size() : nums2.size();
n = (nums1.size() < nums2.size()) ? nums2.size() : nums1.size();
```

- Determine the sizes of the arrays.
- Assign `A` to be the smaller array and `B` to be the larger one, allowing binary search on the smaller array.
- Update `m` and `n` to reflect the sizes of `A` and `B`.

#### Step 2: Initialize Binary Search Range

```cpp
int imin = 0, imax = m, i, j;
```

- `imin` and `imax` mark the search range on the smaller array `A`.
- `i` represents the partition index in `A`, and `j` represents the corresponding index in `B`.

#### Step 3: Perform Binary Search

```cpp
while (imin <= imax) {
    i = (imin + imax) / 2;
    j = (m + n + 1) / 2 - i;

    if (i < m && B[j - 1] > A[i]) 
        imin = i + 1;
    else if (i > 0 && A[i - 1] > B[j])
        imax = i - 1;
    else {
        int lmax;
        if (i == 0) lmax = B[j - 1];
        else if (j == 0) lmax = A[i - 1];
        else lmax = max(A[i - 1], B[j - 1]);

        if ((m + n) % 2 == 1) return lmax;

        int rmin;
        if (i == m) rmin = B[j];
        else if (j == n) rmin = A[i];
        else rmin = min(A[i], B[j]);

        return (double)(lmax + rmin) / 2;
    }
}
```

- Calculate `i` (partition in `A`) and `j` (partition in `B`).
- Adjust binary search based on the conditions:
  - If `i` is too far left, move `imin` right.
  - If `i` is too far right, move `imax` left.
- Once the correct partition is found:
  - Calculate `lmax` (largest element in the left partition).
  - If odd, return `lmax`.
  - Otherwise, calculate `rmin` and return `(lmax + rmin) / 2`.

#### Step 4: Return the Result

- Return `lmax` or `(lmax + rmin) / 2`, depending on whether the total number of elements is odd or even.

### üìà **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: **O(log(min(m, n)))**, due to binary search on the smaller array.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**, only constant space for variables (`imin`, `imax`, `i`, `j`, etc.).

### üéì **Takeaways**

This solution uses binary search and partitioning for a highly efficient approach to find the median without merging. This method leverages the sorted nature of the arrays, offering a powerful strategy for solving similar problems with minimal overhead.

### üí≠ **Practice Makes Perfect!**

When working on binary search-based problems, practice breaking down partition logic, ensuring valid conditions, and calculating required values to hone intuition. This approach can be applied to a range of partition-based search problems on sorted data!
