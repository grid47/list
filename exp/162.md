### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `arr`, find a peak element in the array. A peak element is defined as an element that is greater than its neighbors. For corner elements, only one neighbor is considered.

### Approach
1. **Binary Search**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to represent the bounds of the search space.
   - While `l` is less than or equal to `r`, calculate the midpoint `mid`.
   - Check the conditions:
     - If the current element at `mid` is greater than its left neighbor (or if `mid` is the first element) and greater than its right neighbor (or if `mid` is the last element), then `mid` is a peak.
     - If the left neighbor is greater than the current element, move the right pointer `r` to `mid - 1` to search the left half.
     - If the right neighbor is greater, move the left pointer `l` to `mid + 1` to search the right half.
   - If no peak is found during the iterations, return `l`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Lines 1-4**: Define the function and initialize the size of the array and pointers `l` and `r`.
- **Lines 6-14**: Implement the binary search logic to find the peak element based on neighbor comparisons.
- **Line 15**: Return the index of the peak element.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\log N)\) due to the binary search approach.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) as no additional space proportional to the input size is used.
