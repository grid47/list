### Problem Statement
Implement the flood fill algorithm, which replaces the color of a pixel (and any adjacent pixels with the same color) in a 2D image with a new color.

### Approach
1. **Initial Check**:
   - If the new color is the same as the original color of the pixel at the starting position, return the image immediately to avoid unnecessary processing.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Use a recursive DFS function to explore all connected pixels of the same color.
   - Change the color of the current pixel and recursively call the DFS function for adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right).

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains methods for flood fill.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `vector<vector<int>> floodFill(...)`: Main method that initializes the process.
  - `void dfs(...)`: Recursive helper function that performs the flood fill operation.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(M * N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the image. In the worst case, all pixels are colored.
- **Space Complexity**: O(M * N) for the recursion stack in the worst case (entire image is one connected component).
