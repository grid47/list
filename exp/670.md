### Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `num`, you need to find the maximum number you can obtain by swapping two digits in the number. If no swap can make a larger number, return the original number.

### Approach
1. **Digit Tracking**:
   - Convert the number to a string for easier manipulation.
   - Create an array `idx` of size 10 to track the last occurrence index of each digit (0-9).

2. **Populate Last Occurrence**:
   - Iterate through each digit of the number and update the `idx` array with the index of the last occurrence of each digit.

3. **Finding the Swap**:
   - Traverse the number again:
     - For each digit, check if there exists a larger digit (from 9 down to the current digit) that appears later in the number (using the `idx` array).
     - If such a digit is found, swap the current digit with that larger digit to maximize the number.
     - Immediately convert the modified string back to an integer and return it.

4. **Return Original Number**:
   - If no beneficial swap is found, return the original number.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Input**: The function takes an integer `num`.
2. **Index Tracking**: 
   - A vector `idx` is initialized to track the last occurrence of each digit.
   - The number is converted to a string for manipulation.
3. **Last Occurrence Population**:
   - Loop through the digits of `nm`, updating `idx` with the latest index of each digit.
4. **Swap Logic**:
   - Nested loops check for a larger digit to swap with the current digit.
   - If a larger digit is found, perform the swap and convert back to integer.
5. **Final Return**: If no swaps improve the number, return `num`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of digits in the number. Each digit is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the `idx` array has a fixed size (10) regardless of input size.
