### Problem Statement

The problem is to group anagrams from a given list of strings. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. The goal is to return a list of lists, where each list contains words that are anagrams of each other.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to group words that are anagrams. A fundamental observation is that two words are anagrams if and only if they have the exact same character frequency. Therefore, we can use a frequency-based signature (or "mask") to represent each word, which allows us to group words with the same mask together.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Generate a Signature for Each Word:**
   For each word in the input list, we generate a string that uniquely represents the frequency of each character in the word. This string will serve as the signature (or "mask") for that word. For example, the word "eat" and the word "tea" both share the same frequency distribution (both contain 1 'e', 1 'a', and 1 't'), so they will have the same mask.

2. **Use a Map to Group Words:**
   We use a `map<string, vector<string>>` to store the anagrams. The key is the signature (mask) of the word, and the value is a list of words that share that signature. If two words have the same mask, they are anagrams and are added to the same vector in the map.

3. **Return the Grouped Anagrams:**
   After processing all words, the map contains keys that are the masks and values that are lists of anagrams. We convert these values into a list of lists and return the result.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Creating the Mask for a Word

```cpp
string code(string x) {
    vector<int> q(26, 0);  // Initialize a vector to store the frequency of each letter in the word.
    for(int i = 0; i < x.size(); i++) {
        q[x[i] - 'a']++;  // Increment the count of the character.
    }
    stringstream ss;  // Use a stringstream to construct the string representation of the frequency array.
    for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if(i != 0) ss << ',';  // Separate counts by commas.
        ss << q[i];  // Append the count of the current character to the stringstream.
    }
    return ss.str();  // Return the generated mask as a string.
}
```

1. **Initialize Frequency Array:**
   The function `code` starts by creating a vector `q` of size 26 (for each letter of the alphabet) initialized to zero. This array will store the frequency of each character in the input string `x`.

2. **Count Character Frequencies:**
   For each character in the string `x`, we increment the corresponding index in the frequency array `q`. The index is determined by subtracting `'a'` from the character, which gives us a number between 0 and 25 corresponding to the letters 'a' through 'z'.

3. **Build the Mask:**
   Using a `stringstream`, we construct a string representation of the frequency array `q`. The string is created by concatenating the counts of each character separated by commas.

4. **Return the Mask:**
   Finally, the function returns the string representation of the frequency array, which serves as the "signature" for the input string `x`.

#### Step 2: Grouping Words by Their Masks

```cpp
vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
    map<string, vector<string>> ma;  // Map to store groups of anagrams, using the mask as the key.
    for(string x: strs) {
        string mask = code(x);  // Get the mask for the current word.
        ma[mask].push_back(x);  // Group the word by its mask.
    }
    vector<vector<string>> ans;  // Vector to store the final result.
    for(auto [key, val]: ma)
        ans.push_back(val);  // Add all groups of anagrams to the result vector.
    
    return ans;  // Return the list of anagram groups.
}
```

1. **Initialize the Map:**
   We initialize a `map<string, vector<string>> ma` to store the anagram groups. The key of the map is the mask (i.e., the signature of a word), and the value is a vector of strings containing words that share the same mask.

2. **Process Each Word:**
   We iterate over each word `x` in the input list `strs`. For each word, we generate its mask using the `code` function. We then insert the word into the vector corresponding to its mask in the map.

3. **Build the Final Result:**
   After processing all words, the map `ma` contains keys representing different masks and values representing lists of anagrams. We iterate over each key-value pair in the map and add the list of anagrams (`val`) to the result vector `ans`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   Finally, we return the result vector `ans`, which contains the grouped anagrams as lists of strings.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Generating the Mask:** For each word in the input, we need to process each character to compute its frequency. The time complexity for this is `O(k)` where `k` is the length of the word. If the total number of characters across all words is `n`, the total time for generating masks is `O(n)`.
- **Grouping Words:** For each word, we use the map to insert the mask and the word. Insertion and lookup operations in a `map` are logarithmic in time, i.e., `O(log m)` where `m` is the number of distinct masks. If there are `n` words, the total complexity for grouping is `O(n log m)`, where `m` is the number of distinct groups (which in the worst case can be as large as `n`).
- **Final Grouping:** The final step involves iterating through the map and adding the values to the result. This operation is `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the `O(n log m)` for grouping the words, where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the number of distinct masks. In the worst case, `m` can be equal to `n`, so the time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space for Masks:** The space required to store the masks for all words is proportional to the total number of characters, i.e., `O(n)`.
- **Space for Map and Result:** The map stores each word in one of the anagram groups, and the final result contains all the words. Therefore, the total space complexity is `O(n)`.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently groups anagrams using a frequency-based signature (mask) for each word. By leveraging a map to store groups of words with the same mask, we can group anagrams in an optimized way. The algorithm runs in `O(n log n)` time and uses `O(n)` space, making it suitable for large inputs. The key insight that allows us to solve the problem is the use of character frequency distributions, which ensures that anagrams can be identified and grouped quickly. This solution is both time-efficient and easy to understand, making it an excellent approach to the problem.
