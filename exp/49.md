### Problem Statement
The goal is to group a list of strings into anagrams. An anagram is formed by rearranging the letters of a string to create another string using all the original letters exactly once.

### Approach
1. **Character Count as a Key**:
   - For each string, create a "mask" that represents the count of each character (a-z). This count will serve as a unique identifier for anagrams.

2. **Using a Map to Group Anagrams**:
   - Use a map to associate each unique mask with a list of strings (anagrams) that share that mask.

3. **Constructing the Result**:
   - Iterate through the map and extract the grouped anagrams into the result vector.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function `code`**:
   - This helper function takes a string `x` and constructs a mask as a string.
   - It initializes a vector `q` of size 26 to count occurrences of each character.
   - For each character in the string, it increments the respective index in the vector.
   - It then converts the count vector into a comma-separated string and returns it.

2. **Function `groupAnagrams`**:
   - This function initializes a map `ma` where the key is the anagram mask and the value is a vector of strings.
   - For each string in the input `strs`, it calls the `code` function to get the mask and inserts the string into the corresponding vector in the map.
   - Finally, it constructs the result vector `ans` by extracting the values from the map.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n \cdot k) \), where \( n \) is the number of strings and \( k \) is the maximum length of a string. Each string is processed to count characters.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n \cdot k) \) for storing the grouped anagrams and the character counts.
