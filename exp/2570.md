### Problem Statement

Given two 2D arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, each containing pairs of integers where the first element of each pair is an identifier (e.g., an `ID`), and the second element is a value associated with that identifier, the goal is to merge the two arrays based on these identifiers. If the same identifier appears in both arrays, their values should be summed. The resulting array should list each unique identifier with its total value in sorted order.

### Approach

1. **Use a Map for Merging**:
   - A `map<int, int>` is ideal for merging because it automatically maintains sorted order by key and allows efficient access and modification of values by key.
   - The key of the map will be the identifier, and the value will be the accumulated total for that identifier.

2. **Populate the Map with Values from `nums1`**:
   - Iterate over each pair in `nums1`, where each pair is in the format `[ID, value]`.
   - For each pair, add the value to `m[ID]`. If the ID is already present in the map, the value is added to the existing value; otherwise, a new entry is created.

3. **Merge Values from `nums2` into the Map**:
   - Similarly, iterate over each pair in `nums2`. For each pair `[ID, value]`, add the value to `m[ID]`. If the ID is already present, it is summed with the existing value, effectively merging the values of common IDs from both arrays.

4. **Build the Result Array**:
   - After merging both arrays into the map, iterate over each entry in `m`. Since the map is automatically sorted by keys, we get the identifiers in ascending order.
   - For each entry in the map, create a new pair `[ID, total_value]` and add it to the result array `v`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the array `v`, which contains each unique identifier with its accumulated value, sorted in ascending order by identifier.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Initialize the Map and Populate with Values from `nums1`**:
   ```cpp
   map<int, int> m;
   for(auto& itr : nums1) {
       m[itr[0]] += itr[1];
   }
   ```
   - We declare a map `m` to store identifiers and their total values.
   - For each pair `itr` in `nums1`, add `itr[1]` (the value) to `m[itr[0]]` (the ID key). If the ID exists, the value is summed; otherwise, a new entry is created.

2. **Merge Values from `nums2` into the Map**:
   ```cpp
   for(auto& itr : nums2) {
       m[itr[0]] += itr[1];
   }
   ```
   - Similarly, iterate over `nums2`. For each pair in `nums2`, add the value to `m[ID]`, merging common IDs by summing their values.

3. **Build the Result Array**:
   ```cpp
   vector<vector<int>> v;
   for(auto& itr : m) {
       v.push_back({itr.first, itr.second});
   }
   ```
   - We declare an empty result array `v` to store the final merged pairs.
   - Iterate over each entry in `m`, creating a pair `[ID, total_value]` and adding it to `v`.

4. **Return the Result Array**:
   ```cpp
   return v;
   ```
   - Finally, return `v`, which contains the sorted merged array of identifiers and their corresponding total values.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
   - **Map Insertions**: Each insertion into the map has a logarithmic complexity, \(O(\log N)\), due to the mapâ€™s balanced tree structure.
   - **Total Time Complexity**: The entire merging process is \(O((n + m) \log (n + m))\), where \(n\) is the size of `nums1` and \(m\) is the size of `nums2`.

- **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is \(O(n + m)\) because we store all identifiers and their values in the map.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently merges two arrays by using a map to handle identifier uniqueness, automatically maintaining sorted order. By leveraging map properties, it ensures that the final result is sorted and accurate. This approach is optimal for merging two lists of pairs while minimizing time complexity and achieving concise, readable code.
