### Problem Statement
The problem is to find the longest path in a tree, where each node has a label (character), and we are tasked with finding the longest path where no two adjacent nodes have the same label. The tree structure is given through a parent array `par`, and each node's label is provided by the string `s`. The goal is to determine the length of the longest path that adheres to the condition that no two adjacent nodes in the path have the same character.

### Approach
To solve this problem efficiently, we need to model the tree structure and traverse it in a manner that ensures we respect the adjacency conditions. The solution employs the following key ideas:

1. **Tree Representation**: The tree is represented by the parent array `par` where `par[i]` indicates the parent of node `i`. The string `s` holds the labels of each node.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: A queue is used for a BFS-like traversal, ensuring that we process the nodes in an order that respects the parent-child relationships.
3. **Dynamic Programming (Memoization)**: For each node, we keep track of the longest path from that node, avoiding revisiting already processed nodes. The memoization table `memo` stores the length of the longest path from each node.
4. **Label Comparison**: During traversal, we compare the labels of a node and its parent. If they are different, we update the longest path, otherwise, the path does not extend.
5. **Efficient Path Calculation**: We continually update the longest path found (`mx`) and push nodes into the queue when all their children have been processed.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)
1. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int mx = 1;
   int n = s.size();
   vector<int> memo(n, -1), in(n, 0);
   queue<int> q;
   ```
   - `mx` is initialized to 1 because a single node is always a valid path.
   - `memo` array is used for storing the longest path for each node. Initially, all values are set to `-1` to indicate unprocessed nodes.
   - `in` is an array representing the in-degree (number of incoming edges) of each node.
   - `q` is the queue used for BFS traversal.

2. **Populate In-Degree Array**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       if(par[i] != -1) {
           in[par[i]]++;
       }
   }
   ```
   - This loop updates the in-degree of each node. If a node has a parent (`par[i] != -1`), the parent’s in-degree is incremented.

3. **Queue Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       if(in[i] == 0) {
           q.push(i);
           memo[i] = 1;
       }
   }
   ```
   - Nodes with no incoming edges (in-degree 0) are added to the queue, as they are the starting points of the BFS. These nodes have an initial path length of 1.

4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Path Calculation**:
   ```cpp
   while(!q.empty()) {
       int idx = q.front();
       q.pop();
       if(idx == 0) continue;
       if(s[idx] != s[par[idx]]) {
           if(memo[par[idx]] != -1) {
               mx = max(mx, memo[par[idx]] + memo[idx]);                    
           }
           if(memo[par[idx]] == -1) {
               if(memo[idx] == -1) cout << "Yes";
               memo[par[idx]] = 1 + memo[idx];
           } else if(memo[par[idx]] < 1 + memo[idx]) {
               memo[par[idx]] = 1 + memo[idx];
           }
           mx = max(mx, memo[par[idx]]); 
       }
       in[par[idx]]--;
       if(in[par[idx]] == 0) {
           q.push(par[idx]);
           if(memo[par[idx]] == -1)
               memo[par[idx]] = 1;
       }
   }
   ```
   - The BFS proceeds by popping a node from the queue.
   - If the node is not the root (`idx != 0`), we check if its label differs from its parent's label (`s[idx] != s[par[idx]]`).
     - If they differ, we update the longest path from the parent to include the current node (`memo[par[idx]] = max(memo[par[idx]], memo[idx] + 1)`).
     - We also track the maximum path length found so far (`mx = max(mx, memo[par[idx]])`).
   - After processing a node, we decrement the in-degree of its parent. If the parent’s in-degree becomes 0, it means the parent has no more children to process, so we push it into the queue.
   - If the parent has not yet been processed (i.e., its `memo[par[idx]] == -1`), we initialize its memo value as 1.

5. **Return the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return mx;
   ```
   - After the BFS completes, the maximum path length `mx` is returned as the result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. The BFS traversal visits each node once, and each node’s parent-child relationships are processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. The space is used by the `memo` array, `in` array, and the queue for BFS.

### Conclusion
This algorithm efficiently finds the longest path in a tree where no two adjacent nodes share the same label by leveraging a BFS traversal and dynamic programming (memoization). By processing the tree in a level-wise manner, the algorithm ensures that each node is processed only once, yielding a linear time complexity of O(n), which is optimal for tree traversal problems. The use of BFS ensures that we process nodes in the correct order, and the memoization technique allows us to avoid redundant calculations, making the solution both time and space efficient.
