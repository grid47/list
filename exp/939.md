### Problem Statement
Given a set of points in a 2D plane, the task is to find the minimum area of a rectangle that can be formed using four of these points as vertices. If there is no such rectangle, return 0.

### Approach
1. **Data Structure**:
   - Use an unordered map to store the points. The map's keys are x-coordinates, and the values are sets of y-coordinates. This allows for quick lookups of points.

2. **Iterate Through Pairs**:
   - Loop through all pairs of points `(pts[i], pts[j])`. For each pair:
     - Extract the coordinates: `x1, y1` for the first point and `x2, y2` for the second point.
     - Check if the points can form a rectangle:
       - Ensure the x-coordinates are different (`x1 != x2`) and the y-coordinates are different (`y1 != y2`).
       - Check if the other two corners of the rectangle `(x1, y2)` and `(x2, y1)` exist in the map.

3. **Calculate Area**:
   - If the corners exist, calculate the area of the rectangle formed by the points and update the minimum area found.

### Code Walk-through
- The function initializes a map and populates it with the given points.
- It then checks all combinations of points to determine potential rectangles and calculates their areas.
- Finally, it returns the minimum area found, or 0 if no rectangle can be formed.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2), where N is the number of points. The nested loops check all pairs of points.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the points in the unordered map.
