### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to find the **length of the longest valid parentheses substring** in a given string `s`. A valid parentheses string is defined as a string where every opening parenthesis `'('` has a corresponding closing parenthesis `')'` and the parentheses are properly nested.

For example:
- The string `"(())"` is valid and has a length of 4.
- The string `"(()"` is not valid, and its longest valid substring is `"()"`, which has a length of 2.
- The string `")("` is not valid, and its longest valid substring is of length 0.

Your task is to write an efficient algorithm to determine the length of the longest valid parentheses substring.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we use a **stack** data structure. The idea is based on the following observations:

1. **Valid Parentheses Substrings:** A valid parentheses substring is always balanced, meaning that every opening parenthesis `'('` has a corresponding closing parenthesis `')'` and they are properly nested.
  
2. **Stack Data Structure:** We use a stack to keep track of indices of the characters in the string. The stack will help us determine where valid substrings start and end.

3. **Processing the String:**
   - We iterate through each character of the string. 
   - For each opening parenthesis `'('`, we push its index onto the stack.
   - For each closing parenthesis `')'`, we check if the stack’s top element corresponds to an opening parenthesis `'('` (by checking if the character at the index from the stack is `'('`).
   - If they match, we pop the top of the stack and calculate the length of the valid substring.
   - If they do not match or if the stack is empty, it means we have encountered an unmatched closing parenthesis, so we push the current index onto the stack.

4. **Maximum Length Calculation:** Every time we find a valid substring (i.e., a pair of matching parentheses), we calculate its length and update the maximum length found so far.

5. **Stack Initialization:** To handle edge cases like `"(())"` or `"()"` at the start, we initialize the stack with `-1`, which acts as a base to calculate lengths of valid substrings from the start.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
stack<int> stk;
stk.push(-1);
int maxL = 0;
```
- We initialize a stack and push `-1` onto it. This helps handle cases where the first character is part of a valid substring.
- We also initialize `maxL` to keep track of the maximum length of the valid parentheses substring found.

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
    int t = stk.top();
    if(t != -1 && s[i] == ')' && s[t] == '(') {
        stk.pop();
        maxL = max(maxL, i - stk.top());
    }
    else {
        stk.push(i);
    }
}
```
- **Iteration:** We loop through the string `s` from index `0` to `s.size() - 1`.
- **Stack Check:** For each character `s[i]`:
  - If the stack’s top (`t`) is not `-1` and the character is a closing parenthesis `')'` and the character at index `t` in `s` is an opening parenthesis `'('`, it means we have found a valid pair of parentheses.
  - We pop the top of the stack (removing the matching `'('`), and we calculate the length of the valid substring by subtracting the current top of the stack from `i`. We update `maxL` if this length is greater than the current `maxL`.
- **Push Index:** If the current character does not form a valid pair, we push the current index onto the stack.

```cpp
return maxL;
```
- After the loop finishes, `maxL` contains the length of the longest valid parentheses substring, which we return.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We traverse the string `s` once, and for each character, we perform a constant-time operation of either pushing or popping from the stack. Since we only push and pop each index once, the time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: In the worst case, all indices of the string could be pushed onto the stack. Thus, the space complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. This is due to the space required for the stack.

### Conclusion

The **longestValidParentheses** function efficiently finds the longest valid parentheses substring using a stack-based approach. The algorithm operates in linear time (**O(n)**) and requires linear space (**O(n)**), making it both time-efficient and space-efficient.

By processing each character of the string and maintaining a stack of indices, the algorithm can quickly determine the lengths of valid parentheses substrings and update the maximum length encountered. This approach is optimal and works well for large inputs, where performance is crucial.

This solution is highly applicable to various problems in computational theory and practical applications involving balanced data structures or string manipulations. The stack-based method is a standard approach for problems involving matching or nested parentheses, and this implementation provides an efficient and clean solution to the problem at hand.
