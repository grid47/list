### 🌟 **Longest Valid Parentheses**

This problem asks you to find the **length of the longest valid parentheses substring** in a given string `s`. A valid parentheses substring is defined as one where every opening parenthesis `'('` has a corresponding closing parenthesis `')'`, and the parentheses are properly nested.

For example:
- The string `"(())"` is valid and has a length of 4.
- The string `"(()"` is not valid, and its longest valid substring is `"()"`, which has a length of 2.
- The string `")("` is not valid, and its longest valid substring is of length 0.

### 🧠 **Approach**

To solve this problem efficiently, we use a **stack** data structure, which allows us to track indices of the parentheses in the string and compute the longest valid substring.

#### **Key Observations:**
1. **Valid Parentheses Substrings:** A valid substring must be balanced, meaning each opening parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding closing parenthesis `')'`.
2. **Stack Usage:** The stack helps us track the indices of the parentheses in the string. It is especially useful for identifying when a valid substring ends and for calculating its length.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Initialize Stack:** We start by initializing the stack with `-1`. This base value helps us compute the length of valid substrings that start from the very beginning.
2. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - For each opening parenthesis `'('`, we push its index onto the stack.
   - For each closing parenthesis `')'`, we check the stack to see if there's a matching opening parenthesis `'('` (i.e., if the top of the stack is an opening parenthesis index). If so, we pop the stack and calculate the length of the valid substring.
3. **Calculate Maximum Length:** We maintain a variable `maxL` to track the maximum length of the valid parentheses substring found during the iteration.

#### **Edge Cases:**
- Strings that are already balanced, like `"()"`, should return the correct length immediately.
- Strings with no valid parentheses, like `")("`, should return a length of 0.

### 👇 **Code Breakdown (Step by Step)**

#### **Step 1: Initialize Stack and Max Length**
```cpp
stack<int> stk;
stk.push(-1);  // base for calculating lengths from the start
int maxL = 0;  // variable to store the maximum length
```
- We initialize a stack and push `-1` to handle cases where the first character is part of a valid substring.
- `maxL` will keep track of the longest valid substring.

#### **Step 2: Iterate Through the String**
```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
    int t = stk.top();  // top of the stack
    
    // If the current character is ')' and we have a matching '(' at the stack's top
    if(t != -1 && s[i] == ')' && s[t] == '(') {
        stk.pop();  // pop the matching '('
        maxL = max(maxL, i - stk.top());  // calculate the valid substring length
    }
    else {
        stk.push(i);  // push the current index onto the stack if no match
    }
}
```
- **Loop through each character:**
  - If we encounter a closing parenthesis `')'` and the stack's top corresponds to an opening parenthesis `'('`, we pop the stack and calculate the length of the valid substring.
  - If there's no match or it's an unmatched opening parenthesis `'('`, we push the current index onto the stack.

#### **Step 3: Return Maximum Length**
```cpp
return maxL;  // return the maximum valid parentheses length
```
- After processing the entire string, we return the maximum length of valid parentheses substrings found.

### ⏳ **Time and Space Complexity**

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(n)**: We traverse the string once. For each character, we either push or pop an index from the stack, each of which is a constant-time operation. Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(n)**: In the worst case, all indices could be pushed onto the stack (e.g., if the string contains no valid parentheses). Thus, the space complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string, due to the stack.

### 💡 **Conclusion**

The **longestValidParentheses** function is an efficient solution to the problem, utilizing a stack-based approach to determine the longest valid parentheses substring in **O(n)** time. By processing each character of the string and leveraging the stack to track unmatched parentheses, the algorithm ensures that we find the longest valid substring quickly and efficiently.

This solution works well for large inputs, as it offers both time and space efficiency, with a linear time complexity of **O(n)** and a space complexity of **O(n)**. The stack-based approach is optimal for problems involving nested or matched structures, like parentheses, making it a robust solution for a wide range of similar problems.
