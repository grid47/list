### Problem Statement
Given a string containing just the characters `'('` and `')'`, find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

### Approach
1. **Using a Stack**:
   - Utilize a stack to keep track of indices of the characters in the string. This helps in determining the position of the last unmatched parenthesis.

2. **Initialize the Stack**:
   - Push `-1` onto the stack to handle the edge case of valid substrings starting from index `0`.

3. **Iterate through the String**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is `')'` and the top of the stack is not `-1`, check if the character at that index is `'('`.
       - If it is, a valid pair is found; pop the index from the stack and calculate the length of the valid substring by subtracting the new top of the stack from the current index `i`.
       - Update `maxL` if the new length is greater.
     - If no valid pair is found or the character is `'('`, push the current index onto the stack.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: A stack is initialized with `-1` to track the last unmatched parenthesis index.
2. **Traversal**: As the string is traversed:
   - When a valid pair is found, the top of the stack is popped, and the length of the valid substring is calculated.
   - If the character is `'('`, its index is simply pushed onto the stack.
3. **Result**: The maximum length of valid parentheses is stored in `maxL` and returned.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string since each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) in the worst case for the stack when all characters are `'('`.
