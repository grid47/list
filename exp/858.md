### Problem Statement
You are tasked with finding out which receiver will catch a light ray that starts at one corner of a rectangular room with dimensions `p` and `q`. The light ray reflects off the walls, and you need to determine which corner (0, 1, or 2) it will reach first after an infinite number of reflections.

### Approach
1. **Understanding Reflections**: The light ray will continue to reflect indefinitely in the room. If the dimensions of the room `p` and `q` are both even, you can simplify the problem by dividing both by 2 until at least one of them becomes odd. This is because each time the ray hits a wall, it can be thought of as passing into an adjacent room of the same dimensions.

2. **Determine the Receiver**:
   - If `p` is odd and `q` is even, the ray will reach the top edge and hit receiver 0.
   - If `p` is odd and `q` is odd, the ray will reach the opposite corner and hit receiver 1.
   - If `p` is even and `q` is odd, the ray will hit the bottom edge and hit receiver 2.

3. **Final Calculation**: After simplifying `p` and `q`, the result can be derived using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Result} = 1 - (p \% 2) + (q \% 2)
   \]

### Code Walk-through
- The while loop reduces both `p` and `q` by half whenever they are both even.
- The return statement uses the modulo operation to determine the final receiver based on the parity of `p` and `q`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log(max(p, q))) for reducing `p` and `q`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as only a constant amount of space is used for variables.
