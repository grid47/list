### Problem Statement
Given an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1`, and a list of edges that connect the nodes, find all the minimum height trees (MHTs). A minimum height tree is defined as a tree that has the minimum possible height when rooted at any of its nodes.

### Approach
The solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy to find the centers of the tree, which are the nodes that form the minimum height trees. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there is only one node (`n == 1`), return `[0]` since the single node itself is the only MHT.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - Create an adjacency list `adj` to represent the tree.
   - Maintain a `degree` array to track the number of edges connected to each node.

3. **Build the Graph**:
   - For each edge in `edges`, update the adjacency list and the degree of both connected nodes.

4. **Initialize the Queue**:
   - Push all leaf nodes (nodes with degree `1`) into a queue. These nodes are potential candidates for MHTs.

5. **BFS to Find MHTs**:
   - Perform BFS to gradually remove leaf nodes:
     - While the queue is not empty, clear the result vector and process all current leaf nodes.
     - For each leaf node, decrement the degree of its neighbors. If any neighbor's degree becomes `1`, it becomes a new leaf and is added to the queue.
   - The remaining nodes in the result vector at the end of this process are the roots of the MHTs.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: An integer `n` for the number of nodes, and a vector of edges connecting the nodes.
- **Output**: A vector of integers representing the labels of nodes that form the minimum height trees.

1. Initialize the adjacency list and degree array based on the edges provided.
2. Use a queue to start processing leaf nodes and iteratively find the centers of the tree.
3. Return the result containing the labels of the minimum height tree nodes.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes. Each edge and node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the adjacency list and degree storage.
