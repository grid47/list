### Problem Statement

The problem is to maximize the total value of attending at most `k` non-overlapping events. Each event is represented as an array containing three integers: the start time, the end time, and the value of the event. Given a list of such events and a limit `k`, the goal is to determine the maximum total value achievable by selecting non-overlapping events.

### Approach

The solution uses a dynamic programming approach combined with binary search to efficiently handle the overlapping constraints of events. Here’s the breakdown of the approach:

1. **Sorting Events**: Events are sorted based on their end times. This allows for easier management of overlapping events.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: A DP table is used to store the maximum value obtainable with a certain number of events (`k`). The recursive function checks for each event whether it can be included in the selection or not.

3. **Binary Search**: A helper function uses binary search to find the next non-overlapping event. This is crucial for reducing the time complexity when trying to find suitable events to attend.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here’s a detailed walkthrough of the code.

1. **Data Structures**:
   - `vector<vector<int>> e`: This stores the events.
   - `vector<vector<int>> mem`: This is a memoization table for the DP approach, initialized with `-1` to indicate uncomputed states.

   ```cpp
   vector<vector<int>> e, mem;
   ```

2. **Binary Search Function**:
   The `bs(int num)` function performs a binary search to find the first event that ends after the given number (`num`).

   ```cpp
   int bs(int num) {
       int ans = e.size();
       int l = 0, r = ans - 1;
       while(l <= r) {
           int mid = l + (r - l + 1) / 2;
           if(e[mid][0] > num) {
               ans = mid;
               r = mid - 1;
           } else {
               l = mid  + 1;
           }
       }
       return ans;
   }
   ```

3. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   The `dp(int idx, int k)` function computes the maximum value obtainable starting from event `idx` with `k` remaining events that can be selected.

   ```cpp
   int dp(int idx, int k) {
       if(k == 0 || idx >= e.size()) return 0;
       if(mem[idx][k] != -1) return mem[idx][k];
       
       int ans = dp(idx + 1, k);
       int nxt = bs(e[idx][1]);
       ans = max(ans, dp(nxt, k - 1) + e[idx][2]);
       
       return mem[idx][k] = ans;
   }
   ```

   - The base case checks if no events are left (`k == 0`) or if the index exceeds the event list. In both cases, the function returns `0` since no value can be obtained.
   - The memoization check prevents recalculating results for the same `idx` and `k`.
   - The recursive calls consider two scenarios: either skipping the current event or attending it, plus adding its value to the result of attending the next valid event.

4. **Main Function**:
   The `maxValue(vector<vector<int>>& events, int k)` function sets up the environment for the DP computation.

   ```cpp
   int maxValue(vector<vector<int>>& events, int k) {
       e = events;
       sort(e.begin(), e.end());
       mem.resize(e.size(), vector<int>(k + 1, -1));
       return dp(0, k);
   }
   ```

   - Events are sorted by their start time for easier handling.
   - The memoization table is initialized based on the number of events and allowed selections (`k`).
   - The function returns the result from the `dp` function starting from the first event and allowing up to `k` selections.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm sorts the events in \(O(n \log n)\) and processes each event through the dynamic programming and binary search, leading to a complexity of \(O(n \cdot k + n \log n)\) in total.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n \cdot k)\) due to the memoization table, plus \(O(n)\) for storing the events.

### Conclusion

This solution effectively utilizes a combination of sorting, dynamic programming, and binary search to maximize the total value of selected non-overlapping events. The approach is efficient and well-suited for handling the constraints posed by overlapping events, ensuring that the maximum value is obtained while adhering to the limit on the number of events that can be attended.
