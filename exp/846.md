### Problem Statement
You are given an array `hand` representing a set of cards, where each card is represented by an integer. You are also given an integer `groupSize`. The goal is to determine if you can rearrange the cards into groups of size `groupSize` such that each group consists of consecutive cards.

### Approach
1. **Count Card Frequencies**: Use a `map` to count the occurrences of each card in the `hand`. This allows for efficient access and modification of card counts.

2. **Iterate Through Cards**: For each unique card in the sorted `map`, check if it can start a new group:
   - If the count of the current card (`mp[it.first]`) is greater than zero, it means that there are still cards of that value left to be grouped.

3. **Form Groups**:
   - For each card value, attempt to form a group of consecutive cards:
     - For `i` from 1 to `groupSize - 1`, decrement the count of the next consecutive cards (`it.first + i`) by the count of the current card.
     - If the count of any required consecutive card becomes negative, return `false`, as it indicates that there are not enough cards to form a complete group.

4. **Mark Current Card as Used**: Once a group has been formed, set the count of the current card to 0, indicating that it has been used.

5. **Final Check**: If all groups can be formed, return `true`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N), where N is the number of cards in `hand`. The logarithmic factor comes from the operations on the `map` during insertion and access.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the frequencies of the cards in the `map`.
