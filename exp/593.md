### Problem Statement
Determine if four points in a 2D plane form a square.

### Approach
1. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Create a helper function `d` that calculates the squared distance between two points to avoid dealing with floating-point precision. The squared distance is calculated as:
     \[
     d(p, q) = (p[0] - q[0])^2 + (p[1] - q[1])^2
     \]
   - This function takes two vectors representing the coordinates of the points.

2. **Using a Set for Distances**:
   - Calculate the squared distances between all pairs of the four points. Store these distances in a set to automatically handle duplicates.
   - There should be no zero distance (indicating that points are not distinct), and the set should contain exactly two unique distances: one for the sides of the square and one for the diagonals.

3. **Validation**:
   - Check if the set has a size of 2 (indicating two unique distances).
   - Ensure that the zero distance is not present in the set (indicating that the points are distinct).

### Code Walk-through
- The function `validSquare` computes the squared distances for all combinations of the four points.
- It uses a set to keep track of the unique squared distances and checks the conditions outlined.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as the number of distance calculations is constant regardless of the input (always four points).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the set size is limited to at most 2 unique squared distances.
