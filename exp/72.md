### üí° **Edit Distance Problem (Levenshtein Distance)** ‚Äì Let's Solve It Together!

The **Edit Distance** problem is a classic challenge in string manipulation. The task is to find the **minimum number of operations** required to convert one string into another using three operations:
1. **Insert a character**
2. **Delete a character**
3. **Replace a character**

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, our goal is to return the minimum number of operations to transform `word1` into `word2`.

### üìù **Problem Breakdown**

You are given:
- **`word1`** and **`word2`** ‚Äî two strings that you need to transform.
  
The goal is to compute the **minimum number of operations** required to convert `word1` into `word2`.

### üîç **Approach: Dynamic Programming**

This problem can be efficiently solved using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. We will maintain a table (2D array) `dp`, where each entry `dp(i, j)` represents the minimum number of operations required to convert the substring `word1[0..i-1]` to `word2[0..j-1]`. This allows us to break the problem into smaller sub-problems and solve it recursively.

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **State Representation**:
   - Let `dp(i, j)` represent the minimum number of operations required to convert the substring `word1[0..i-1]` to `word2[0..j-1]`.
   - Our goal is to compute `dp(a.size(), b.size())`, where `a` and `b` are `word1` and `word2` respectively.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If either string is empty:
     - `dp(i, 0)` represents converting `word1[0..i-1]` to an empty string, requiring `i` deletions.
     - `dp(0, j)` represents converting an empty string to `word2[0..j-1]`, requiring `j` insertions.

3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - If `a[i]` equals `b[j]`, no operation is needed, so we move diagonally: `dp(i, j) = dp(i+1, j+1)`.
   - If the characters are different, we compute the minimum of the following:
     - **Insertion**: Insert `b[j]` into `word1`, giving `dp(i, j+1) + 1`.
     - **Deletion**: Delete `a[i]`, giving `dp(i+1, j) + 1`.
     - **Replacement**: Replace `a[i]` with `b[j]`, giving `dp(i+1, j+1) + 1`.
   - We take the minimum of these three options.

4. **Memoization**:
   - We use memoization to avoid redundant calculations, storing results of sub-problems in a 2D array `memo[i][j]`. If `memo[i][j]` is not `-1`, we return the stored value directly.

5. **Final Result**:
   - The final result will be stored in `memo[0][0]`, which gives the minimum number of operations to convert `word1` to `word2`.

### üßë‚Äçüíª **Let‚Äôs Look at the Code!**

Here‚Äôs how we can implement this approach in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int dp(int i, int j, const string& a, const string& b, vector<vector<int>>& memo) {
    if(i == a.size() && j == b.size()) return 0;  // Both strings are at the end
    if(i == a.size()) return b.size() - j;  // Insert remaining characters of b
    if(j == b.size()) return a.size() - i;  // Delete remaining characters of a
    if(memo[i][j] != -1) return memo[i][j];  // Return already computed result
    
    int ans = 0;
    if(a[i] != b[j]) {
        ans = min({dp(i+1, j, a, b, memo), dp(i, j+1, a, b, memo), dp(i+1, j+1, a, b, memo)}) + 1;  // Min of insert, delete, replace
    } else {
        ans = dp(i + 1, j + 1, a, b, memo);  // No operation needed if chars are equal
    }
    return memo[i][j] = ans;  // Store the result in memo table
}

int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
    vector<vector<int>> memo(word1.size() + 1, vector<int>(word2.size() + 1, -1));
    return dp(0, 0, word1, word2, memo);  // Start the recursive DP function
}
```

### üåü **Handling Edge Cases**

- If one of the strings is empty, the result is the length of the other string, as we would need to insert or delete all the characters.
- If both strings are identical, no operations are needed, and the result will be `0`.

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity**

- **Time Complexity**:  
  **O(m * n)** ‚Äî where `m` is the length of `word1` and `n` is the length of `word2`. The algorithm computes the result for every pair `(i, j)` in the `m x n` memoization table, and each computation takes constant time.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  **O(m * n)** ‚Äî The space complexity is also **O(m * n)** due to the memoization table storing results for all sub-problems.

### üí° **Why This Approach is Efficient**

By using **Dynamic Programming with memoization**, we avoid redundant calculations and efficiently solve the problem in **O(m * n)** time. This approach ensures that we only compute each sub-problem once, storing the results to be reused when needed.

### üèÅ **You Got This!**

The Edit Distance problem is a great example of how breaking a problem into smaller sub-problems can simplify the solution. By using Dynamic Programming, you can efficiently solve string transformation problems. Keep practicing, and soon you‚Äôll be mastering more complex challenges!
