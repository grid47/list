### Problem Statement
Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, find the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` into `word2`. The allowed operations are: 
1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a 2D DP table to store the minimum edit distance for all substrings of `word1` and `word2`.
2. **Base Cases**:
   - If one string is empty, the edit distance is the length of the other string (all insertions or deletions).
3. **State Transition**:
   - If the current characters of both strings are equal, continue to the next characters without any operation.
   - If they are not equal, consider the minimum of the following three operations:
     - **Insert**: Convert the substring up to `word1[i]` and `word2[j-1]` and add one for the insertion.
     - **Delete**: Convert the substring up to `word1[i-1]` and `word2[j]` and add one for the deletion.
     - **Replace**: Convert the substring up to `word1[i-1]` and `word2[j-1]` and add one for the replacement.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: Store the input strings `word1` and `word2` in member variables `a` and `b`. Initialize the `memo` table with size equal to the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, filled with `-1` to indicate uncomputed values.
2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Check for base cases (when either string is fully processed).
   - If characters match, move to the next characters.
   - If not, calculate the minimum edit distance considering the three operations and store the result in `memo`.
3. **Result**: The minimum edit distance from the first characters of both strings is returned.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(M \times N) \), where \( M \) and \( N \) are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, respectively. Each substring is computed once.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(M \times N) \) for the DP table to store computed results.
