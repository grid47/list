### Problem Statement

The problem is to find the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into another using the following operations:
1. **Insert a character**.
2. **Delete a character**.
3. **Replace a character**.

This is known as the **Edit Distance** problem or **Levenshtein Distance**. Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, the goal is to return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` into `word2`.

### Approach

This problem can be solved efficiently using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. The idea is to break the problem into smaller sub-problems, which can be solved recursively and stored for future use. Specifically, we will maintain a table (2D array) where each entry represents the minimum number of operations required to convert the first `i` characters of `word1` to the first `j` characters of `word2`.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **State Representation**:
   - Let `dp(i, j)` represent the minimum number of operations required to convert the substring `word1[0..i-1]` to `word2[0..j-1]`.
   - The goal is to compute `dp(a.size(), b.size())`, which gives the minimum number of operations required to convert the entire string `a` (word1) to the entire string `b` (word2).

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If either string is empty:
     - `dp(i, 0)` represents converting `word1[0..i-1]` to an empty string, which requires `i` deletions.
     - `dp(0, j)` represents converting an empty string to `word2[0..j-1]`, which requires `j` insertions.

3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - If the characters `a[i]` and `b[j]` are the same, no operation is needed, and we move diagonally: `dp(i, j) = dp(i+1, j+1)`.
   - If they are different, we consider all possible operations:
     - **Insertion**: Insert `b[j]` into `word1`, which results in the problem `dp(i, j+1) + 1`.
     - **Deletion**: Delete `a[i]`, which results in the problem `dp(i+1, j) + 1`.
     - **Replacement**: Replace `a[i]` with `b[j]`, which results in the problem `dp(i+1, j+1) + 1`.
   - We take the minimum of these three options.

4. **Memoization**:
   - To avoid redundant calculations, we use **memoization**, which stores already computed values in a 2D array `memo[i][j]`. If `memo[i][j]` is not `-1`, we return its value directly.

5. **Final Result**:
   - The result will be stored in `memo[0][0]`, representing the minimum number of operations to convert `word1` to `word2`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

```cpp
string a, b;
vector<vector<int>> memo;
```

- We define two strings `a` and `b` to store the input words.
- We define a 2D vector `memo` to store the results of sub-problems. Initially, it will be filled with `-1` to signify that a sub-problem has not been solved yet.

#### Step 2: Define the Recursive DP Function

```cpp
int dp(int i, int j) {
    if(i == a.size() && j == b.size()) return 0;
    if(i == a.size()) return b.size() - j;
    if(j == b.size()) return a.size() - i;
    if(memo[i][j] != -1) return memo[i][j];
    int ans = 0;
    if(a[i] != b[j]) {
        ans = min({dp(i+1,j), dp(i,j+1), dp(i+1,j+1)}) + 1;
    } else {
        ans = dp(i + 1, j+ 1);
    }
    return memo[i][j] = ans;
}
```

- The `dp` function computes the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1[0..i-1]` to `word2[0..j-1]`.
- The function first checks for base cases:
  - If both `i` and `j` are at the end of their respective strings, return `0`, as no operations are needed.
  - If one string is empty, return the number of characters remaining in the other string (this corresponds to insertions or deletions).
- The function then checks if the result for `dp(i, j)` has already been computed. If it has, return the value from `memo[i][j]`.
- If the characters `a[i]` and `b[j]` are different, the function computes the minimum number of operations by considering three possibilities: insertion, deletion, and replacement.
- If the characters are the same, no operation is needed, and the function simply moves diagonally.

#### Step 3: Initialize the DP Table and Start the Calculation

```cpp
int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
    this->a = word1;
    this->b = word2;
    memo.resize(a.size(), vector<int>(b.size(), -1));
    return dp(0, 0);
}
```

- We initialize the input strings `a` and `b` with `word1` and `word2`.
- We resize the `memo` table to be of size `a.size() + 1` by `b.size() + 1` to accommodate all sub-problems, and initialize all entries with `-1`.
- We start the recursive calculation by calling `dp(0, 0)`, which computes the minimum number of operations to convert `word1` to `word2`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the length of `word1` and `n` is the length of `word2`. This is because the algorithm computes the result for every pair `(i, j)` in the `m x n` memoization table, and each computation takes constant time.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also `O(m * n)`, as we need a 2D `memo` table of size `m x n` to store the results of the sub-problems.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into another using dynamic programming with memoization. By breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems and using previously computed results, the solution avoids redundant calculations and achieves an optimal time complexity of `O(m * n)`. This approach is a standard and effective solution for problems involving string transformation and edit distance.
