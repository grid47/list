### Problem Statement

The task is to generate all possible combinations of well-formed parentheses for a given number `n`. Each combination should contain exactly `n` opening parentheses `(` and `n` closing parentheses `)` and should be valid (balanced). The goal is to return all valid combinations as a list of strings.

#### Input:
- A single integer `n` representing the number of pairs of parentheses.

#### Output:
- A list of strings, where each string represents a valid combination of parentheses.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we will use **backtracking**. Backtracking is a technique where we build potential solutions step-by-step and backtrack whenever we encounter an invalid state. In this case, we can generate the valid parentheses strings by following these rules:

1. We can add an opening parenthesis `(` as long as the number of opening parentheses is less than `n`.
2. We can add a closing parenthesis `)` only if the number of closing parentheses is less than the number of opening parentheses added so far. This ensures that every closing parenthesis matches an opening parenthesis.

By recursively exploring all possibilities while maintaining these constraints, we can generate all valid combinations.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's go through the code and explain it in detail:

#### 1. `generateParenthesis` Function

```cpp
vector<string> generateParenthesis(int n) {
    vector<string> ans;
    gen("", ans, 0, 0, n, 0);
    return ans;
}
```

- **Purpose**: This function serves as the entry point for generating the well-formed parentheses combinations. 
- It initializes an empty vector `ans` to store the valid parentheses combinations.
- It then calls the helper function `gen` with an initial empty string (`""`), the result vector (`ans`), and the parameters `open = 0`, `closed = 0`, and `n` (the number of pairs of parentheses to generate).

#### 2. `gen` Function (Backtracking Logic)

```cpp
void gen(string op, vector<string> &ans, int open, int closed, int n, int i) {
    if(i == 2*n) {
        ans.push_back(op);
        return;
    }
    
    if(open < n) {
        gen(op + "(", ans, open + 1, closed, n, i + 1);
    }
    if(open > closed) {
        gen(op + ")", ans, open, closed + 1, n, i + 1);
    }
}
```

- **Purpose**: This is the core of the backtracking process. It tries to generate all valid parentheses strings.
- **Parameters**:
  - `op`: The current string being formed (starting from an empty string).
  - `ans`: The vector where we store valid combinations.
  - `open`: The current number of opening parentheses `(` used.
  - `closed`: The current number of closing parentheses `)` used.
  - `n`: The total number of pairs of parentheses to generate.
  - `i`: The index indicating the current position in the string (helps in controlling the recursion depth).
  
- **Base Case**: 
    ```cpp
    if(i == 2*n) {
        ans.push_back(op);
        return;
    }
    ```
    When `i == 2 * n`, it means we've reached the end of a valid string of parentheses. At this point, we add `op` to the result vector `ans`.

- **Recursive Case**:
    - **Adding an opening parenthesis `(`**:
        ```cpp
        if(open < n) {
            gen(op + "(", ans, open + 1, closed, n, i + 1);
        }
        ```
        If the number of opening parentheses is less than `n`, we can add an opening parenthesis to the current string `op` and recursively call `gen` with updated parameters.
    
    - **Adding a closing parenthesis `)`**:
        ```cpp
        if(open > closed) {
            gen(op + ")", ans, open, closed + 1, n, i + 1);
        }
        ```
        If the number of opening parentheses is greater than the number of closing parentheses, we can add a closing parenthesis `)` to the current string `op` and recursively call `gen` with updated parameters.

This way, the function explores all possible combinations of opening and closing parentheses while ensuring that the parentheses are balanced.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(4^n / √n)**, where `n` is the number of pairs of parentheses.
  - The recursive backtracking approach explores all possible combinations of parentheses, and the number of valid combinations grows exponentially with `n`. The exact count of valid combinations is given by the Catalan number, which has an asymptotic growth of **O(4^n / √n)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of pairs of parentheses.
  - The recursion depth can go up to `2 * n` because the function `gen` generates a string of length `2 * n`. The space used by the recursion stack is proportional to this depth, so the space complexity is **O(n)**.

### Conclusion

The problem of generating all valid parentheses combinations can be efficiently solved using the backtracking technique. The key idea is to:
- Add an opening parenthesis `(` if there are fewer than `n` opening parentheses.
- Add a closing parenthesis `)` if there are more opening parentheses than closing parentheses.
- Use a recursive function to explore all possible combinations, and add valid combinations to the result list once they reach a length of `2 * n`.

Key benefits of this solution:
- **Elegance**: The backtracking approach is elegant and directly reflects the constraints of the problem.
- **Efficiency**: Although the problem grows exponentially, the backtracking approach ensures that we only explore valid combinations, which is more efficient than brute-force approaches.
  
In conclusion, this backtracking solution is optimal for generating all valid parentheses combinations and is a perfect example of how recursion can be used to solve problems involving sequences with constraints.
