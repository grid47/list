### Problem Statement

The problem at hand asks for the minimum number of replacements required to make an array non-increasing. Specifically, the array `nums` is a sequence of integers, and the task is to perform replacements such that after the transformation, each element is greater than or equal to the subsequent one. Replacements are done by dividing an element into smaller parts. The goal is to minimize the number of such divisions or replacements needed to ensure that the sequence becomes non-increasing.

### Approach

This problem can be solved using a greedy approach. Here's how we approach it:

1. **Key Observation:**
   - A number can be divided into smaller parts to ensure the sequence remains non-increasing. The task is to find the minimum number of parts (divisions) required for each number such that the next part is smaller than or equal to the previous one.
   - Specifically, for each element in the array, we check how many times it needs to be divided to ensure that the result is smaller than or equal to the next element.
   
2. **Greedy Strategy:**
   - We start from the second-to-last element of the array and move backward. For each element `nums[i]`, we compare it with the next element `nums[i + 1]` (which is being processed already, as we are working backwards).
   - We calculate how many parts the current element can be divided into such that each part is less than or equal to the next element. The number of divisions required is determined by dividing the element by the next element and rounding up if there's a remainder.
   - The total number of divisions is accumulated to calculate the total replacements needed for the entire array.

3. **Why Moving Backwards Works:**
   - By moving from right to left, we are ensuring that each element is adjusted in relation to the next element, guaranteeing that the sequence remains non-increasing. Adjusting the elements from right to left makes it easier to minimize the number of divisions required.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

```cpp
long long minimumReplacement(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    long long ans = 0, prv = nums[n - 1];
```

- We initialize the function `minimumReplacement`, which accepts the array `nums`.
- `n` stores the length of the `nums` array.
- `ans` is used to accumulate the total number of replacements (divisions) needed.
- `prv` holds the last element of the array, which acts as the reference for the next elements as we process the array from right to left.

#### Step 2: Iterate Through the Array

```cpp
for(int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    int cnt = nums[i] / prv;
```

- We start a loop from the second-to-last element (`i = n - 2`) and move leftwards.
- `cnt` is initialized to the number of parts `nums[i]` can be divided into when each part is smaller than or equal to `prv` (the next element being processed).

#### Step 3: Handle Remainder When Dividing

```cpp
    if(nums[i] % prv != 0) {
        cnt++;
        prv = nums[i] / cnt;
    }
```

- If `nums[i]` is not perfectly divisible by `prv`, we increment `cnt` to account for the remainder.
- We also update `prv` to ensure that the next element in the sequence is smaller than or equal to the last division's value. `prv` is now set to `nums[i] / cnt`, which represents the new value each part of `nums[i]` will hold.

#### Step 4: Accumulate the Result

```cpp
    ans += cnt - 1;
}
```

- For each element, the number of replacements required is `cnt - 1`, since we are counting how many divisions are necessary (with the original element counted as 1).
- We add this value to `ans` to accumulate the total number of replacements needed.

#### Step 5: Return the Result

```cpp
return ans;
```

- Finally, after processing all elements, the total number of replacements (or divisions) is stored in `ans`, which is returned as the result.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

- The algorithm iterates over the array from right to left, processing each element exactly once. For each element, we perform a constant number of operations (division, comparison, and updates).
- Thus, the time complexity of the algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.

#### Space Complexity:

- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space: a few integer variables for tracking the result and the previous element (`prv`).
- Therefore, the space complexity is `O(1)`.

### Conclusion

The solution efficiently calculates the minimum number of replacements required to make an array non-increasing by processing the array from right to left. This greedy approach ensures that each element is adjusted optimally with minimal divisions to make the sequence non-increasing. With a time complexity of `O(n)` and space complexity of `O(1)`, the algorithm is highly efficient and suitable for large input sizes.

This approach is ideal for scenarios where the task involves adjusting sequences or arrays under constraints, and it offers a clear, step-by-step procedure for achieving the desired result with minimal computation. The key insight is recognizing the relationship between the current and next elements in the sequence and adjusting each element in the most efficient way possible.
