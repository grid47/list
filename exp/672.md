### Problem Statement
You have `n` lights that can be turned on or off, and you can perform up to `m` operations. The operations can toggle the state of the lights. The goal is to determine how many unique states the lights can achieve after performing up to `m` operations.

### Approach
The solution leverages the properties of the operations on the lights rather than simulating each operation. Depending on the values of `n` and `m`, the number of unique configurations can be determined using simple conditional checks.

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `m == 0`: Thereâ€™s only one configuration (all lights off), so return `1`.
   - If `n == 1`: You can either turn the single light on or off, resulting in `2` configurations.
   - If `n == 2` and `m == 1`: You can achieve three configurations (00, 01, 10), so return `3`.
   - If `n == 2`: Regardless of `m`, you can achieve four configurations (00, 01, 10, 11).
   - If `m == 1`: With three or more lights, you can toggle all lights, yielding four configurations.
   - If `m == 2`: With two or more lights, you can achieve seven configurations by toggling pairs or individual lights.
   - If `m >= 3`: With more than two operations, all lights can be independently toggled, leading to `8` configurations (from 000 to 111).

2. **Return Value**:
   - Based on the checks, return the corresponding number of unique light configurations.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Input**: The function accepts two integers, `n` (number of lights) and `m` (number of operations).
2. **Conditional Checks**: A series of `if` statements determine the return value based on the values of `n` and `m`.
3. **Output**: The function outputs the number of unique configurations possible after up to `m` operations.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as the solution involves a fixed number of conditional checks regardless of input size.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional data structures are used that grow with input size.
