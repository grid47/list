### Problem Statement:

The problem asks us to determine how many distinct states a set of lights can be in after performing a sequence of operations. The operations consist of flipping one or more lights at a time, and we are given two parameters:
- **n**: The number of lights.
- **m**: The number of operations.

The goal is to compute the total number of distinct states the lights can be in after performing the given number of operations. The light states can be flipped according to the following rules:
1. Flip all the lights.
2. Flip the odd-indexed lights.
3. Flip the even-indexed lights.
4. Flip exactly one light.

### Approach:

This problem can be broken down into analyzing the different states the lights can reach based on the number of lights `n` and the number of operations `m`. The key insight is that the number of distinct states of the lights after flipping operations depends on the number of lights and how many times we are allowed to flip them.

The flipping operations on the lights can be grouped into several categories:
- **No flip**: The lights remain in their initial state.
- **One flip**: A single flip operation that affects all or specific lights (odd/even indexed lights).
- **Two flips**: Multiple flips can create distinct configurations, such as flipping all lights twice, which brings the lights back to the initial state.

To compute the number of distinct light configurations, we need to consider how many unique combinations of flips can result from `n` and `m`. The key observations that lead to the solution are:
1. If no operations are performed (`m=0`), the lights stay in their initial state, so there is only one distinct state.
2. With one flip operation, we can generate up to four distinct configurations for `n >= 2`.
3. With two or more flip operations, the number of distinct states increases, but the upper limit is constrained by the number of lights and operations.

By examining these observations, we can summarize the problem into specific cases based on `n` and `m`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step):

The code is a simple function that uses conditional statements to return the number of distinct states based on the values of `n` and `m`. Here's the breakdown of each case:

#### Case 1: No Operations (`m == 0`)
```cpp
if(m == 0) return 1;
```
- If no operations are performed (`m == 0`), the lights remain in their initial state, so there is only one possible configuration.

#### Case 2: One Light (`n == 1`)
```cpp
if(n == 1) return 2;
```
- If there is only one light (`n == 1`), there are two possible configurations: the light can either be on or off. This means there are two distinct states.

#### Case 3: Two Lights, One Operation (`n == 2 && m == 1`)
```cpp
if(n == 2 && m == 1) return 3;
```
- If there are two lights (`n == 2`) and one operation (`m == 1`), the possible configurations are:
  1. Both lights are off.
  2. Both lights are on.
  3. Only one light is on (either the first or the second light).
  This gives three distinct states.

#### Case 4: Two Lights, More than One Operation (`n == 2`)
```cpp
if(n == 2) return 4;
```
- If there are two lights (`n == 2`), regardless of how many operations are performed (`m >= 1`), there are four possible states:
  1. Both lights are off.
  2. Both lights are on.
  3. Only the first light is on.
  4. Only the second light is on.

#### Case 5: One Operation (`m == 1`)
```cpp
if(m == 1) return 4;
```
- If there is exactly one operation (`m == 1`), there are four distinct configurations, similar to the case for `n == 2` with multiple lights.

#### Case 6: Two Operations (`m == 2`)
```cpp
if(m == 2) return 7;
```
- If there are two operations (`m == 2`), the possible configurations are expanded to seven distinct states. This is because performing two flips on a larger set of lights creates more distinct configurations, such as flipping all lights twice or flipping specific sets of lights.

#### Case 7: Three or More Operations (`m >= 3`)
```cpp
if(m >= 3) return 8;
```
- If there are three or more operations (`m >= 3`), the number of distinct configurations stabilizes at 8. This is the maximum number of distinct configurations that can be reached with multiple flips, since flipping the lights in different combinations results in no more than 8 unique configurations.

### Complexity:

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The time complexity of the function is constant because the solution is based purely on conditional checks. It does not involve any loops or recursion, and it simply returns the number of distinct configurations based on the values of `n` and `m`.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant because no additional space is used that grows with the input size. The function only uses a few variables for the conditional checks, so the space complexity is O(1).

### Conclusion:

This solution is efficient with constant time and space complexity. The number of distinct light configurations is determined based on a few simple rules about how flips affect the state of the lights. The approach is optimal for this problem, as it avoids unnecessary calculations and directly returns the result based on the values of `n` and `m`.

By examining different scenarios (such as the number of lights and the number of operations), we conclude that the maximum number of distinct light configurations for a set of lights is 8, which occurs when there are 3 or more operations. This solution is both simple and effective for solving the problem within the given constraints.
