### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in ascending order, and possibly rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand, find the index of a target value. If the target is not found, return -1.

### Approach
1. **Binary Search in Rotated Sorted Array**:
   - Use a modified binary search to handle the rotation of the array.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Set `s` to the start index (0) and `e` to the end index (`n - 1`).

3. **Iterate while Search Space is Valid**:
   - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
   - Check if the middle element equals the target; if yes, return `mid`.
   - Determine which part of the array is sorted:
     - If the left part (from `s` to `mid`) is sorted:
       - If the target lies within this sorted range, adjust the end index `e`.
       - Otherwise, adjust the start index `s`.
     - If the right part (from `mid` to `e`) is sorted:
       - If the target lies within this sorted range, adjust the start index `s`.
       - Otherwise, adjust the end index `e`.

4. **Result**:
   - If the target is not found by the end of the loop, return -1.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start (`s`) and end (`e`) pointers are set.
2. **Binary Search Logic**: Calculate `mid`, check for target equality, and adjust search range based on sorted subarrays.
3. **Return Value**: Index of target if found, or -1 if not.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(\log n)\) since we are halving the search space each iteration.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) as no additional space is used.
