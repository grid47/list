### Problem Statement
Convert a Roman numeral string into its equivalent integer value.

### Approach
Utilize a reverse traversal of the Roman numeral string, adjusting the total based on the relative values of consecutive Roman numeral characters.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Get the length of the input string `s` and initialize `res` with the integer value of the last character using the helper function `RomToNum`.
   - Set `prv` to the value of the last Roman numeral character, and `curr` to hold the value of the current character being processed.

2. **For Loop**:
   - Iterate through the string from the second-to-last character to the first:
     - Convert the current Roman numeral character to its integer value using `RomToNum`.
     - Compare `curr` (the value of the current character) with `prv` (the value of the previous character):
       - If `curr` is less than `prv`, subtract `curr` from `res` (indicating a subtractive combination, e.g., IV = 4).
       - Otherwise, add `curr` to `res`.
     - Update `prv` to be the value of `curr` for the next iteration.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Once all characters have been processed, return the computed integer value `res`.

4. **Helper Function `RomToNum`**:
   - This function converts a single Roman numeral character to its integer value using a switch statement.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) - where \(n\) is the length of the Roman numeral string since each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) - no additional space is used that scales with input size; only a few integer variables are maintained.
