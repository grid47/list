### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` containing `n` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]`, there is one integer that is duplicated and another that is missing. Your task is to find and return these two integers.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a vector `ans` to store the duplicated and missing numbers.

2. **Iterate through the Array**:
   - For each number in the array, determine its absolute value (`val`).
   - Use the value to toggle the corresponding index in the `nums` array (by negating it).
   - Maintain the XOR of the expected index and the current index. This helps in finding the missing number later.

3. **Identify the Duplicated Number**:
   - If the value at the corresponding index (after negation) is negative, it indicates that the number has been seen before, so store this number as the duplicate.

4. **Calculate the Missing Number**:
   - After the loop, use the XOR value computed to determine the missing number.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - The result contains the duplicated and the missing number.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Loop through the `nums` Array**:
   - For each index `i`, calculate `val` as the absolute value of `nums[i]`.
   - XOR the current index (1-based) and `val` into `ans[1]` to maintain the running XOR of seen values.
   - If the value at the index corresponding to `val` is negative, assign `val` to `ans[0]` (the duplicate). Otherwise, negate it to mark it as seen.

2. **Finalize the Missing Number**:
   - XOR `ans[0]` with `ans[1]` to derive the missing number.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - The final vector `ans` contains the duplicate at index 0 and the missing number at index 1.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the solution uses a constant amount of extra space for the answer.
