### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, sort it in descending order based on the frequency of characters. Characters with the same frequency should maintain their relative order from the input string.

### Approach
1. **Frequency Counting**:
   - Use an unordered map to count the frequency of each character in the string.

2. **Bucket Sort**:
   - Create a vector of strings (`bucket`) where the index represents the frequency of characters. Each index `i` will store a string of characters that appear `i` times.
   - Populate this bucket with characters based on their frequencies.

3. **Constructing the Result**:
   - Iterate through the `bucket` in reverse order (from highest frequency to lowest) to construct the final sorted string.
   - Append the characters from each non-empty bucket to the result string.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Frequency Counting**:
   - Iterate through each character in the string and count its occurrences using an unordered map (`freq`).

2. **Populating the Bucket**:
   - For each character in the frequency map, append the character to the corresponding index in the `bucket` based on its frequency.

3. **Building the Result String**:
   - Loop through the `bucket` from the end to the beginning, appending the non-empty strings to the result (`res`).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string, as we traverse the string to count frequencies and then again to construct the result.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the frequency map and the bucket of strings.
