### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find the number of ways to partition an array into two subsets such that the sum of elements in each subset does not exceed a given value `k`. This problem is constrained by the fact that the subsets' sums must be less than or equal to `k`, and the number of ways to divide the array needs to be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Approach

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming (DP) with memoization. The idea is to recursively consider each element in the array and decide whether to include it in the first subset or the second subset. We will use a top-down dynamic programming approach, where the state is represented by:
- The current index `idx` in the array we are considering.
- The remaining sum available for the first subset `l1`.
- The remaining sum available for the second subset `l2`.

By storing the results of subproblems (i.e., the number of ways to partition from a given state), we can avoid recomputing results for the same state, ensuring the solution runs efficiently.

### Code Breakdown

#### Class Variables:
```cpp
vector<unordered_map<int, int>> mem;
vector<int> nums;
vector<int> twos;    
int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
int n;
```
- `mem`: A memoization table to store the results of the subproblems. We use a vector of unordered maps because the state depends on both the current index and the remaining sum for both subsets.
- `nums`: The input array representing the elements to be partitioned.
- `twos`: A cache to store precomputed powers of 2, used for calculating the number of ways to partition the remaining elements efficiently.
- `mod`: The modulus \(10^9 + 7\), used to return the answer modulo this value.
- `n`: The size of the input array `nums`.

#### `pos` Function - Power Calculation:
```cpp
int pos(int n) {
    if(n == 0) return 1;
    if(twos[n] != -1) return twos[n];
    long ans;
    if(n % 2) {
        ans = pos(n / 2);
        ans = (ans * ans * 2) % mod;
    } else {
        ans = pos(n / 2);
        ans = (ans * ans) % mod;            
    }
    return twos[n] = ans;
}
```
- This function calculates \(2^n \mod (10^9 + 7)\) using memoization. 
- It recursively computes the powers of 2. If the value has already been computed, it returns it from the `twos` array to save time.
- If `n` is even, it squares the result of \(2^{n/2}\). If `n` is odd, it computes the same but multiplies by an additional `2` to handle the odd case.

#### `dp` Function - Recursive Dynamic Programming:
```cpp
int dp(int idx, int l1, int l2) {
    if(idx == n) return (l1 <= 0 && l2 <= 0);

    if(l1 <= 0 && l2 <= 0) {
        return pos(n - idx) % mod;
    }
    int s = l1 * 10000 + l2;
    if(mem[idx].count(s)) return mem[idx][s];

    long ans = dp(idx + 1, l1 - nums[idx] <= 0? 0: l1 - nums[idx], l2) % mod;

    ans = (ans + dp(idx + 1, l1, l2 - nums[idx] <= 0? 0: l2 - nums[idx])) % mod;

    return mem[idx][s] = ans;
}
```
- **Base Case**: If `idx == n`, meaning we have processed all elements in the array, we return `1` if both subsets have sums less than or equal to `0`. Otherwise, return `0`.
  
- **Condition to Early Terminate**: If both subsets have no remaining sum (`l1 <= 0` and `l2 <= 0`), the only option left is to place all remaining elements in the current subsets. The result for this case is \(2^{n - idx} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), as all remaining elements can freely go into either subset.

- **Memoization Check**: We use the `mem` table to store already computed results for specific states (`l1`, `l2`). This ensures we do not compute the same subproblem multiple times.

- **Recursive Calls**: We make two recursive calls:
  - One for placing the current element (`nums[idx]`) in the first subset and decreasing the sum of the first subset (`l1`).
  - Another for placing the current element in the second subset and decreasing the sum of the second subset (`l2`).

- **Modulo Operation**: Every result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure the number does not overflow and to meet the problem's requirements.

#### `countPartitions` Function - Main Driver:
```cpp
int countPartitions(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    sort(begin(nums), end(nums), greater<int>());
    n = nums.size();
    mem.resize(n);
    twos.resize(n + 1, -1);
    this->nums = nums;
    return dp(0, k, k);
}
```
- **Sorting**: The `nums` array is sorted in descending order to optimize the partitioning process. Sorting helps in reducing the number of possibilities by ensuring that we consider the largest elements first, leading to faster pruning of invalid subsets.
  
- **Initialization**: We initialize the necessary variables: `mem`, `twos`, and `nums`.

- **Calling DP**: The recursive function `dp` is called with the initial index `0`, and the total remaining sum for both subsets (`k`).

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Memoization**: The function `dp` is called at most once for each unique state. The state is defined by the current index `idx` and the two remaining sums `l1` and `l2`. 
  - The number of possible states is \(O(n \times k^2)\), where `n` is the size of the array, and `k` is the upper bound of the sum for each subset.
  
- **Power Calculation**: The `pos` function computes powers of 2 in logarithmic time with respect to `n`, so its time complexity is \(O(\log n)\).

- **Total Complexity**: The overall time complexity of the algorithm is \(O(n \times k^2)\), as we are computing results for all states and the power calculations are logarithmic.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Memoization Table**: The space used by the `mem` table is \(O(n \times k^2)\), as we store results for each possible combination of `idx`, `l1`, and `l2`.

- **Auxiliary Space**: The `twos` array also requires \(O(n)\) space for caching the powers of 2.

- **Total Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n \times k^2)\).

### Conclusion

The solution efficiently counts the number of ways to partition an array into two subsets with sums less than or equal to `k` using dynamic programming with memoization. The approach leverages recursive exploration of possible subset divisions and optimizes calculations by storing intermediate results. The use of sorting helps improve the efficiency of the partitioning process. The solution is effective for moderately large input sizes, with a time complexity of \(O(n \times k^2)\).
