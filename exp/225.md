### Problem Statement
Design a stack that supports the following operations:
1. `push`: Push an element onto the stack.
2. `pop`: Remove the element on the top of the stack.
3. `top`: Get the top element of the stack.
4. `empty`: Return whether the stack is empty.

### Approach
- **Data Structure**: Utilize a single queue to simulate the stack's behavior.
- **Push Operation**: 
  - Push the new element onto the queue.
  - Rotate the queue to maintain the order of elements such that the last pushed element is at the front.

### Code Walk-through
- **Constructor**: Initializes an empty queue.
- **push(int x)**:
  - Pushes the element `x` into the queue.
  - Rotates the queue to move all previous elements behind the newly added element.
  
- **pop()**:
  - Retrieves and removes the element at the front of the queue, which represents the top of the stack.
  
- **top()**:
  - Returns the front element of the queue without removing it, representing the top of the stack.
  
- **empty()**:
  - Checks if the queue is empty, returning `true` if it is, otherwise `false`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - `push`: \(O(n)\) due to the rotation of the queue.
  - `pop` and `top`: \(O(1)\) as they directly access the front of the queue.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the stack, since all elements are stored in the queue.
