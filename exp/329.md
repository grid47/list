### Problem Statement
Given an \(m \times n\) integer matrix `mtx`, find the length of the longest increasing path in the matrix. From each cell, you can move to any of the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) if the value in the adjacent cell is greater than the value in the current cell.

### Approach
The approach utilizes Depth First Search (DFS) combined with memoization to explore paths in the matrix. The key steps include:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Store the dimensions of the matrix and initialize data structures for memoization (`memo`) and visitation tracking (`vis`).

2. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function takes the current cell indices `(i, j)` and returns the length of the longest increasing path starting from that cell.
   - If the result for the cell has already been computed (i.e., `memo[i][j] != -1`), return the stored value.
   - Mark the current cell as visited.
   - Check all four possible directions (up, down, left, right) to see if you can move to a cell with a greater value. If so, recursively call `dfs` on that cell.
   - Unmark the current cell after exploring its neighbors.
   - Store the computed result in `memo`.

3. **Main Function**:
   - Iterate through each cell in the matrix, invoking the `dfs` function to find the longest increasing path starting from each cell.
   - Keep track of the maximum length found.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A 2D vector representing the integer matrix.
- **Output**: An integer representing the length of the longest increasing path.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns, since each cell is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) for the memoization and visitation matrices.
