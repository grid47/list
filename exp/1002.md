# Comprehensive Guide to Finding Common Characters in Strings

In the world of programming, finding common elements among a collection of data structures is a frequent task. One interesting challenge is to find common characters that appear across a list of strings. In this article, we will dissect a C++ solution that efficiently identifies these common characters. We will break down the code step by step, elucidating its logic and functionality while ensuring it is SEO-friendly for better visibility.

## Problem Overview

The objective is to identify characters that are common to all strings in a given list. For instance, if we have the input `["bella", "label", "roller"]`, the expected output should be the characters `["e", "l", "l"]`. The characters 'e' and 'l' appear in every string, and our solution must efficiently determine this.

## Code Explanation

Let's analyze the provided C++ code. The code employs a systematic approach to find the common characters, leveraging arrays to count occurrences and maintain minimum frequencies.

### Step 1: Class Definition

The code starts with defining a class named `Solution`. This class encapsulates the method we will use to find the common characters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
```

### Step 2: Method Declaration

Within the class, we declare a public method named `commonChars`, which takes a vector of strings as input and returns a vector of strings representing the common characters.

```cpp
    vector<string> commonChars(vector<string>& words) {
```

### Step 3: Initializing Frequency Array

Inside the method, we first create a frequency array `frq` of size 26 (for each letter of the English alphabet) initialized to `INT_MAX`. This array will help us track the minimum frequency of each character found across all input strings.

```cpp
        vector<int> frq(26, INT_MAX);
```

### Step 4: Iterating Through Words

Next, we iterate over each string in the input vector `words`. For each string, we will count the occurrences of each character.

```cpp
        for(string& s: words) {
```

### Step 5: Counting Characters

For counting, we initialize a temporary array `cnt` of size 26 to zero. This array will hold the count of characters for the current string being processed.

```cpp
            vector<int> cnt(26, 0);
```

We then loop through each character in the string `s`, updating the count in the `cnt` array. The character's corresponding index in the `cnt` array is calculated by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the character.

```cpp
            for(char x: s) cnt[x - 'a']++;
```

### Step 6: Updating Minimum Frequencies

After counting the characters in the current string, we need to update our `frq` array. This is done by comparing the current counts in `cnt` with the existing values in `frq`. We take the minimum of the current frequency and the counted frequency for each character.

```cpp
            for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
                frq[i] = min(frq[i], cnt[i]);
```

This ensures that `frq` retains the minimum count of each character that has been encountered so far across all strings.

### Step 7: Collecting Results

After processing all words, we initialize an empty vector `res` to store the results.

```cpp
        vector<string> res;
```

We then loop through the `frq` array to construct the result vector. For each character index that has a non-zero count, we append that character to `res` as many times as it appears in common.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
            for(int j = 0; j < frq[i]; j++)
                res.push_back(string(1, 'a' + i));
```

### Step 8: Returning the Result

Finally, the method returns the result vector containing all the common characters.

```cpp
        return res;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(N * M), where N is the number of strings and M is the average length of the strings. This is because we iterate through each string and count characters.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1) since the frequency array `frq` and count array `cnt` are of fixed size (26). Thus, regardless of the number of strings or their lengths, the space usage remains constant.

## Conclusion

This C++ solution is a clear and efficient approach to finding common characters in a list of strings. By using frequency arrays and simple loops, we can achieve the desired results with minimal overhead. Understanding this algorithm not only helps in this particular problem but also enhances one's overall programming and problem-solving skills.

Whether you are preparing for coding interviews, working on competitive programming problems, or simply looking to improve your coding proficiency, grasping the nuances of such algorithms is invaluable. The presented solution exemplifies clarity, efficiency, and effectiveness in tackling a common problem in string manipulation.
