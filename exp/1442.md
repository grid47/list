### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to count the number of triplets \((i, j, k)\) in an array such that \(0 \leq i < j < k < n\) and the bitwise XOR of the elements from index \(i\) to \(k\) equals zero. More formally, given an array `nums`, we need to find the number of triplets \((i, j, k)\) satisfying:

\[
\text{XOR}(nums[i], nums[i+1], \ldots, nums[k]) = 0
\]

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the properties of the XOR operation. The key insight is that if the XOR of elements from index \(i\) to \(k\) is zero, then the cumulative XOR up to \(i\) must be equal to the cumulative XOR up to \(k + 1\). This allows us to reduce the problem to counting pairs of indices with equal cumulative XOR values.

The approach can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Compute Cumulative XOR**: Calculate an array where each element at index \(i\) represents the XOR of all elements in the original array from the start up to index \(i-1\).

2. **Count Pairs**: Use a nested loop to count the number of pairs of indices \((i, j)\) such that the cumulative XOR up to \(i\) is equal to the cumulative XOR up to \(j\). For each pair, the number of valid \(k\) values can be determined.

3. **Return the Count**: The result will be the total number of valid triplets.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Letâ€™s analyze the provided code in detail:

1. **Class Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
   ```

   - We define a class named `Solution`, which contains the method to count the triplets.

2. **Function Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   int countTriplets(vector<int>& nums) {
   ```

   - The function `countTriplets` takes a reference to a vector of integers `nums` as input, representing the array we want to analyze.

3. **Variable Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int res = 0, n = nums.size();
   vector<int> arr(n + 1, 0);
   ```

   - We initialize a result variable `res` to count the number of valid triplets and a variable `n` to store the size of the input array. We also declare a vector `arr` of size \(n + 1\) to hold the cumulative XOR values.

4. **Calculate Cumulative XOR**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++)
       arr[i] = arr[i - 1] ^ nums[i - 1];
   ```

   - This loop populates the `arr` vector such that each element at index \(i\) contains the XOR of all elements from the start of the `nums` array up to index \(i-1\). This is done using the cumulative property of XOR.

5. **Count Valid Pairs**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
       for(int j = i + 1; j < n + 1; j++)
           if(arr[i] == arr[j])
               res += j - i - 1;
   }
   ```

   - We use a nested loop to iterate through all pairs of indices \((i, j)\). If the cumulative XOR values at these indices are equal, it means that there are \(j - i - 1\) valid \(k\) indices that can be chosen (since \(k\) must be greater than \(j\)). We increment `res` by this count.

6. **Return the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return res;
   }
   ```

   - Finally, the function returns the total count of valid triplets.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n^2)\) due to the nested loops used to count pairs of indices. For each index \(i\), we check all subsequent indices \(j\), leading to a quadratic time complexity.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n)\) because we use an additional array `arr` of size \(n + 1\) to store the cumulative XOR values.

### Conclusion

This solution effectively counts the number of triplets in the input array that satisfy the given condition by leveraging the properties of the XOR operation. By calculating cumulative XOR values and counting pairs of indices with equal cumulative values, we can efficiently determine the total number of valid triplets.

#### Key Takeaways:

1. **XOR Properties**: Understanding the properties of XOR is crucial in solving problems that involve bit manipulation, especially when cumulative values are involved.

2. **Cumulative Calculation**: The approach demonstrates how cumulative calculations can simplify complex problems by reducing the search space.

3. **Efficiency Considerations**: While this solution is clear and straightforward, it also highlights the importance of recognizing when more efficient algorithms (e.g., using hashing or bitwise techniques) might be necessary for larger datasets.

In summary, the implementation is a solid approach to counting triplets in an array using XOR properties, with clear steps and explanations.
