### Problem Statement
Given a non-tail node in a singly linked list, delete the node from the list. You are only given access to that node, not the head of the list.

### Approach
Since we do not have access to the previous node and cannot directly change the pointers leading to `node`, we instead:
1. Copy the value from the next node (`node->next`) into `node`.
2. Update `node->next` to point to the next-next node (skipping the original next node).
3. Delete the copied next node to free memory.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A non-tail node in a linked list.
- **Output**: None (modifies the linked list in-place to remove the specified node).

1. Store `node->next` in a temporary pointer `nxt`.
2. Copy `*nxt` (value and next pointer) into `*node`.
3. Delete `nxt` to free the memory.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(1)\) since only a few pointer operations are performed.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) as no additional memory is required apart from a temporary pointer.
