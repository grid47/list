### Problem Statement

In this problem, you are given a **singly linked list**, and your task is to delete a node **from the linked list**, given only access to that specific node. Typically, a node in a singly linked list can be deleted by altering the previous node’s `next` pointer to skip the node to be deleted. However, in this scenario, you are not given access to the previous node. You are only given access to the node that needs to be deleted, and your task is to delete this node.

A **ListNode** is defined with the following structure:

```cpp
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode* next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
};
```

Here, each node in the list has a `val` (integer value) and a `next` pointer that points to the next node in the list. The task requires you to delete the node at the given position without having access to the head of the list or the previous node.

### Approach

The typical method of deleting a node in a singly linked list involves altering the `next` pointer of the previous node. However, since we do not have access to the previous node in this problem, we need to adopt a different approach to solve the problem.

Here’s a concise overview of the approach:

1. **Node Copying**:
    - The key observation in this problem is that we don't need to physically delete the node we are given; instead, we can copy the value from the next node into the current node and then delete the next node.
    - Essentially, instead of deleting the node directly, we overwrite the current node's value with the value of the next node. This effectively removes the current node, because we are replacing it with its successor.

2. **Update Next Pointer**:
    - After copying the value of the next node into the current node, we adjust the `next` pointer of the current node to skip the next node.
    - This ensures that the current node is now pointing to the node after the next, effectively "removing" the next node from the linked list.

3. **Delete the Next Node**:
    - Finally, we delete the next node. Since we have already copied its value into the current node, the next node is now redundant and can be safely deleted.

This approach works because you are essentially transforming the node to be deleted into its next node, and then deleting the next node, which is now redundant.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
```
- The class `Solution` contains the method `deleteNode`, which takes a pointer to the node that needs to be deleted (`ListNode* node`).

```cpp
        auto nxt = node->next;
```
- The variable `nxt` is a pointer that stores the reference to the next node (`node->next`). We will use this pointer to access and manipulate the next node.

```cpp
        *node = *nxt;
```
- The expression `*node = *nxt` copies the contents of the next node (`nxt`) into the current node (`node`).
- This effectively replaces the current node’s value with the value of the next node.
- Additionally, the `next` pointer of the current node is updated to point to the node after `nxt`, because `nxt->next` is assigned to `node->next`.

```cpp
        delete nxt;
```
- After copying the next node's value into the current node, we delete the next node (`nxt`). Since the current node has now taken the place of the next node, deleting the next node has no adverse effects on the integrity of the list.

```cpp
    }
};
```
- The method ends here. The current node has now been deleted (by copying the next node's value and removing the next node).

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)**. This is because the solution works in constant time. We only perform a fixed number of operations (copying the value and deleting the next node), and there is no need for any traversal or iteration through the linked list. Regardless of the size of the list, these operations always take constant time.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)** as well. The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space (a few pointers), and there are no additional data structures or recursive calls that consume extra memory.

### Conclusion

This solution is highly efficient for the given problem, and it makes clever use of pointer manipulation to achieve the task of deleting a node in a singly linked list without access to the previous node. 

### Key Points:
1. **Problem Understanding**: Normally, deleting a node requires modifying the `next` pointer of the previous node. However, in this case, we only have access to the node to be deleted.
   
2. **Effective Solution**: The solution works by copying the value from the next node into the current node, and then deleting the next node. This simulates the deletion of the current node.

3. **Efficiency**: The solution works in constant time and uses constant space, making it optimal for the problem at hand.

4. **Robustness**: This solution handles edge cases effectively, such as when the node to be deleted is the last node in the list. Since the problem guarantees that the node to be deleted is not the last node, there is no need for special handling of this edge case.

This approach is commonly used in scenarios where you need to delete a node in a singly linked list but do not have access to the head of the list or the previous node, such as in certain interview questions or competitive programming problems.
