### Problem Statement

The task requires us to transform a given string by capitalizing the first letter of words that have more than two letters, while ensuring that all other letters in each word are in lowercase. The final output should maintain the original word boundaries in terms of spaces, and it should return the modified string with the appropriate capitalization applied.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Iterate through the String**: We will traverse the string character by character to identify words based on spaces.
2. **Identify Word Boundaries**: As we traverse, we will track the start and end of each word to determine its length.
3. **Transform the Word**: For each word:
   - Convert all characters to lowercase.
   - If the word's length is greater than two, capitalize the first character of that word.
4. **Construct the Result**: As we modify the characters in the string, we will construct the final result based on the transformations we apply.

This approach is efficient as it processes each character of the string only once, maintaining the overall complexity at a manageable level.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the implementation:

1. **Class Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
   ```
   - The `Solution` class is defined, which contains the method responsible for capitalizing the title.

2. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   string capitalizeTitle(string s) {
   ```
   - The public member function `capitalizeTitle` is declared, which takes a string `s` as input and returns the transformed string.

3. **Iterate Over Characters**:
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0, j = 0; i <= s.size(); ++i) {
   ```
   - We use a `for` loop that iterates over the indices of the string `s`. The variable `i` tracks the current character's index, while `j` is used to mark the start of each word.

4. **Check for Word End**:
   ```cpp
   if (i == s.size() || s[i] == ' ') {
   ```
   - We check if we have reached the end of the string (`i == s.size()`) or if the current character is a space (`s[i] == ' '`). This indicates that we have found the end of a word.

5. **Process the Word**:
   ```cpp
   if (i - j > 2)
       s[j] = toupper(s[j]);
   j = i + 1;
   ```
   - We calculate the length of the word by subtracting `j` from `i`. If the length of the word is greater than 2, we capitalize the first character of the word by updating `s[j]` to its uppercase equivalent using `toupper`.
   - After processing the word, we update `j` to `i + 1` to mark the start of the next word.

6. **Convert Remaining Characters to Lowercase**:
   ```cpp
   else
       s[i] = tolower(s[i]);
   ```
   - If we are still inside a word, we convert the current character to lowercase to ensure that all letters except the first one are in lowercase.

7. **Return the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return s;
   }
   ```
   - After processing the entire string, we return the modified string `s`, which now contains the capitalized words as per the specified rules.

8. **End of Class**:
   ```cpp
   };
   ```
   - This curly brace marks the end of the `Solution` class definition.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. We traverse the string a single time to apply the transformations.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are modifying the input string in place and using a constant amount of extra space for variables.

### Conclusion

The `capitalizeTitle` function efficiently transforms the input string by applying the rules for capitalizing words based on their lengths. By processing the string in a single pass, we ensure optimal performance while adhering to the requirements of the problem.

This implementation showcases the effective use of string manipulation techniques in C++, including character iteration, conditional checks, and transformations. The solution is concise and leverages the language's built-in functions like `toupper` and `tolower` to simplify the character handling process.

In summary, this method of title capitalization is a great example of how to utilize fundamental programming constructs to achieve a specified outcome, providing clarity and correctness in the final result. Whether dealing with various input formats or edge cases, this function is robust enough to handle typical use cases of title formatting in strings.
