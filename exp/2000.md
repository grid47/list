### Problem Statement

The problem involves reversing a substring of a given string `word` from the beginning of the string up to and including the first occurrence of a specified character `ch`. If the character `ch` does not exist in the string, the string should be returned unchanged. This operation is a common string manipulation task that requires efficiently finding the position of the character and performing a reversal on the substring.

### Approach

To tackle this problem, we will follow a straightforward approach:

1. **Finding the Character**: Use the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `word`. This method returns the index of the character if found or `string::npos` if the character is not present.

2. **Reversing the Substring**: If the character is found, we will reverse the substring from the beginning of the string to the index of the found character, inclusive. This can be achieved using the `reverse` function from the `<algorithm>` library.

3. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we will return the modified string. If the character was not found, we return the original string without any modifications.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's break down the provided code for a better understanding:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reversePrefix(string word, char ch) {
```
- We define a class named `Solution` that contains a public method `reversePrefix`.
- The method takes two parameters: a string `word` and a character `ch`.

```cpp
        auto p = word.find(ch);
```
- We use the `find` method to search for the first occurrence of the character `ch` within the string `word`. The result is stored in the variable `p`. 
- `p` will hold the index of the character if found, or `string::npos` if the character is not present.

```cpp
        if (p != string::npos)
            reverse(begin(word), begin(word) + p + 1);
```
- We check if `p` is not equal to `string::npos`, which indicates that the character was found in the string.
- If found, we use the `reverse` function to reverse the substring from the start of the string up to and including the character at index `p`.
- The `begin(word)` function gets an iterator to the beginning of the string, and `begin(word) + p + 1` points to the position right after the character `ch`.

```cpp
        return word;
    }
};
```
- Finally, we return the modified string `word`. If the character `ch` was not found, `word` remains unchanged and is returned as is.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity for this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `word`. This is due to the need to search for the character and possibly reverse a substring of the string.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) if we consider the in-place reversal of the string. No additional data structures are used that scale with input size.

### Conclusion

The provided solution effectively solves the problem of reversing a substring of a string up to the first occurrence of a specified character. By leveraging the `find` and `reverse` functions, the implementation remains concise and efficient. This approach is beneficial in scenarios involving string manipulations, such as formatting, parsing, and data transformation tasks.

The code handles both cases—when the character is present and when it is not—ensuring robustness. This makes it a valuable snippet for software development involving string operations.

### Example Usage

Here’s how you might utilize the `Solution` class to reverse the prefix of a string:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string word = "abcdefg";
    char ch = 'c';
    
    string result = sol.reversePrefix(word, ch);
    cout << "Result: " << result << endl; // Output: "cbadefg"
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `Solution` class, define the string `word`, and specify the character `ch`. When we call the `reversePrefix` method, it reverses the substring up to the first occurrence of `ch`, resulting in the output "cbadefg". If we change `ch` to a character not present in `word`, the original string is returned unchanged. 

This implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of the solution in real-world scenarios and emphasizes the utility of string manipulation techniques in programming.
