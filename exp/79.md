### Problem Statement
Given a 2D board of characters and a string `word`, determine if the word exists in the grid. The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically), and the same letter cell may not be used more than once.

### Approach
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Implement a DFS to explore possible paths for constructing the word starting from each cell in the grid.

2. **Grid Traversal**:
   - Iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, initiate the DFS if the first character of the word matches the cell's character.

3. **DFS Function**:
   - Check if the current index in the word matches the character in the grid.
   - If the entire word is matched (`idx == w.size()`), return true.
   - Mark the cell as visited to avoid using it again in the same path.
   - Recursively explore the four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
   - After exploring, unmark the cell as visited to allow for other paths.

4. **Return Result**:
   - If any DFS call returns true, the function returns true. If no paths lead to a match, return false.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Store the grid, word, and its dimensions.
   - For each cell, check for a potential match and call the DFS function.

2. **DFS Logic**:
   - Validate the current cell against the corresponding character in the word.
   - Mark the current cell as visited and attempt to explore neighboring cells.
   - After exploration, backtrack by unmarking the cell.

3. **Final Check**:
   - If the word can be formed, return true; otherwise, return false.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(m \times n \times 4^L) \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are the dimensions of the grid, and \( L \) is the length of the word. Each cell can branch out in four directions, leading to an exponential growth of paths.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(m \times n) \) for the visited array, plus the recursive call stack which can go as deep as the length of the word.
