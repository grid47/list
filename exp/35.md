### Problem Statement
Given a sorted array of distinct integers `nums` and a target value `target`, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

### Approach
1. **Binary Search**:
   - Utilize binary search to find the target efficiently.
   - Maintain two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to represent the current search bounds.

2. **Loop Until Found or Bounds Crossed**:
   - Calculate the midpoint `mid`.
   - If the element at `mid` equals the target, return `mid`.
   - If the element at `mid` is less than the target, move the left pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - If the element at `mid` is greater than the target, move the right pointer to `mid - 1`.

3. **Insert Position**:
   - If the target is not found, the loop will exit when `l` exceeds `r`, and the left pointer `l` will point to the correct insert position for the target.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: Set `l` to the start of the array and `r` to the end.
2. **While Loop**:
   - Calculate `mid` and compare `nums[mid]` with `target`.
   - Adjust the search bounds based on the comparison results.
3. **Return**: After the loop, return `l`, which represents the index for insertion.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(\log n)\) due to the binary search mechanism.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) as it uses a constant amount of space.
