### Problem Statement

Given a **sorted array of integers** and a **target value**, the problem asks us to find the **index** at which the target value should be **inserted** in the array while maintaining the sorted order. If the target is already present in the array, we should return the index of its current position.

For example:
- **Input:** `nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]`, `target = 5`
- **Output:** `2` (because 5 is at index 2)

- **Input:** `nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]`, `target = 2`
- **Output:** `1` (because 2 should be inserted at index 1)

- **Input:** `nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]`, `target = 7`
- **Output:** `4` (because 7 should be inserted at index 4)

### Approach

This problem can be efficiently solved using **binary search**, which allows us to find the **insertion index** in **O(log n)** time complexity. Here’s how binary search can be applied to this problem:

1. **Binary Search Overview:**
   - Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that efficiently locates an element in a sorted array.
   - It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half based on comparisons with the middle element.

2. **Problem Breakdown Using Binary Search:**
   - We are tasked with finding the correct **position for insertion** of the target value.
   - The idea is to use binary search to identify where the target would fit in the array.
   - If the target exists in the array, binary search will return its index.
   - If the target does not exist, binary search will return the index where the target should be inserted to keep the array sorted.

3. **Steps in the Approach:**
   - Start by initializing two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), which represent the search bounds.
   - Perform the binary search while `l <= r`:
     - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
     - If `nums[mid]` is equal to the target, return `mid` as the target’s index.
     - If `nums[mid]` is less than the target, adjust the left pointer (`l = mid + 1`) to search the right half.
     - If `nums[mid]` is greater than the target, adjust the right pointer (`r = mid - 1`) to search the left half.
   - After the loop ends, `l` will point to the first position where the target can be inserted.

4. **Binary Search Key Insight:**
   - When the target is not found, the pointer `l` will indicate where the target **should be inserted**.
   - If the target is greater than all elements in the array, `l` will point to the index after the last element.
   - If the target is smaller than some elements, `l` will point to the index where the target can be inserted while maintaining the array’s sorted order.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
int l = 0, r = nums.size() - 1;
```
- **Step 1:** We initialize two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) that represent the bounds of the array. Initially, `l` is set to `0` (the first index), and `r` is set to `nums.size() - 1` (the last index of the array).

```cpp
while(l <= r) {
    int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
```
- **Step 2:** We enter a loop that continues as long as `l <= r`, meaning there are still elements to search. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index `mid` using the formula `l + (r - l) / 2`. This ensures that we avoid potential overflow that might occur with the formula `(l + r) / 2`.

```cpp
if(nums[mid] == target) return mid;
```
- **Step 3:** We check if the element at the middle index (`nums[mid]`) is equal to the target. If it is, we return the index `mid`, since we’ve found the target.

```cpp
if(nums[mid] < target) l = mid + 1;
else r = mid - 1;
```
- **Step 4:** If `nums[mid]` is less than the target, we know the target must be in the right half of the array, so we adjust the left pointer to `l = mid + 1` to search the right half.
- If `nums[mid]` is greater than the target, we adjust the right pointer to `r = mid - 1` to search the left half.

```cpp
return l;
```
- **Step 5:** If the loop exits without finding the target, it means the target is not in the array. At this point, the left pointer `l` will point to the correct insertion index, and we return `l`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(log n):** Since we are using binary search, the time complexity is **O(log n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. Each iteration of the binary search cuts the search space in half, leading to a logarithmic number of steps.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space. The space complexity is **O(1)** because only a few integer variables (`l`, `r`, and `mid`) are used to perform the search.

### Conclusion

The `searchInsert` function uses a highly efficient binary search algorithm to find the **index to insert** the target value into a **sorted array**. This approach guarantees a time complexity of **O(log n)**, making it very efficient for large datasets. By using binary search, the function minimizes the number of comparisons needed, providing an optimal solution for the problem. The space complexity remains **O(1)**, as no additional data structures are required. This solution is ideal for scenarios where performance is critical, such as when dealing with large arrays.
