### Problem Statement
Given a singly linked list, remove the \( n^{th} \) node from the end of the list and return its head.

### Approach
1. **Calculate the Length**: Traverse the linked list to determine its length.
2. **Find the Target Node**: Calculate the position of the target node to be removed using the formula \( \text{target} = \text{length} - n \).
3. **Remove the Node**:
   - If the target node is the head (i.e., if \( \text{length} = n \)), return the head's next node.
   - Otherwise, traverse the list to the node just before the target node and adjust its `next` pointer to skip the target node.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialize Variables**: Start by initializing a pointer to traverse the linked list and a counter to track the size of the list.
2. **Count Size**: Use a while loop to count the total number of nodes in the linked list.
3. **Identify Target Node**: Calculate the position of the node to be removed based on the input \( n \).
4. **Traverse to Target**: If the target is not the head, traverse to the node before the target and update the `next` pointer to bypass the target node.
5. **Return Head**: Return the head of the modified linked list.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(L) \), where \( L \) is the length of the linked list, since we traverse the list at least twice (once for size calculation and once for removal).
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \), as we are using a constant amount of extra space for pointers and variables.
