### Problem Statement
Design a complete binary tree inserter, where you can insert values while maintaining the completeness of the tree.

### Approach
1. **Data Structure**:
   - Use a vector `tree` to keep track of the nodes in level order.

2. **Constructor**:
   - Initialize the `CBTInserter` with the root node.
   - Use a loop to traverse the tree in level order, adding each node to the `tree` vector.

3. **Insert Method**:
   - Create a new `TreeNode` for the value to be inserted.
   - Determine the parent index based on the current size of the `tree`:
     - If the size is even, insert the new node as the left child.
     - If odd, insert as the right child.
   - Add the new node to the `tree` vector and return the value of the parent node.

4. **Get Root Method**:
   - Return the root node of the tree, which is always the first element in the `tree` vector.

### Code Walk-through
- The constructor builds the initial vector of nodes by traversing the given binary tree in level order.
- The `insert` method efficiently places new nodes while ensuring the tree remains complete.
- The `get_root` method provides quick access to the tree's root.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - **Insert**: O(1) for adding a node, as it directly accesses the last node.
  - **Get Root**: O(1) since it simply returns the first element.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as it stores all nodes in the vector.
