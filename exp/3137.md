### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to determine the minimum number of operations required to make a string **k-periodic**. A string is said to be **k-periodic** if it consists of the same substring of length `k` repeated multiple times. For example, if the string is `"ababab"`, it is 2-periodic because `"ab"` repeats three times.

Given a string `s` of length `n` and an integer `k`, the goal is to determine how many operations are required to change characters in `s` such that `s` becomes `k-periodic`. An operation consists of changing a single character in the string.

### Approach

The main goal is to make the string consist of repeated blocks of size `k`. We can achieve this by analyzing the string in blocks of `k` characters and then modifying the blocks to make them all identical. The minimal number of changes will be determined by how frequently each substring of length `k` appears and how we can choose the most frequent substring as the base for the repetition.

The solution can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Dividing the String into Substrings of Length `k`**:
   We divide the string into substrings of length `k` (for example, if `k = 3`, divide the string into chunks like `s[0:3]`, `s[3:6]`, etc.).

2. **Counting the Frequency of Each Substring**:
   We use a hashmap to count how many times each substring of length `k` appears. This helps us identify which substring appears most frequently.

3. **Calculating the Number of Changes**:
   The optimal strategy to make the string `k-periodic` is to convert all substrings to the one that appears most frequently. Thus, the minimum number of changes will be the total number of substrings minus the frequency of the most frequent substring.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   Finally, the number of operations required is calculated as the difference between the total number of substrings and the number of times the most frequent substring appears.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Initial Setup**:
   We first initialize the size of the string `n` and a hashmap `mp` to store the frequency of each substring of length `k`.
   
   ```cpp
   int n = s.size();
   map<string, int> mp;
   ```

2. **Dividing the String into Substrings and Counting Frequencies**:
   We loop through the string in steps of `k`, extracting substrings of length `k` and counting their frequencies in the map `mp`.

   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < n / k; i++) {
       mp[s.substr(i * k, k)]++;
   }
   ```

   Here, `s.substr(i * k, k)` extracts the substring starting from index `i * k` of length `k`. The frequency of each substring is incremented in the map.

3. **Finding the Maximum Frequency**:
   We now find the most frequent substring by iterating through the map. `lg` stores the highest frequency, while `net` keeps the total number of substrings.

   ```cpp
   int lg = 0, net = 0;
   for(auto it: mp) {
       lg = max(lg, it.second);
       net += it.second;
   }
   ```

   Here, `lg` is updated with the maximum frequency, and `net` is the sum of all frequencies (i.e., the total number of substrings).

4. **Calculating the Result**:
   The minimum number of operations is the total number of substrings (`net`) minus the number of substrings that are already the most frequent (`lg`).

   ```cpp
   return net - lg;
   ```

   This is the final step where the result is returned.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n/k)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We iterate through the string in chunks of size `k` to extract substrings. The number of iterations is `n/k`, and for each iteration, extracting the substring and updating the map takes constant time (since we are working with substrings of fixed length `k`).

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n/k)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. The space complexity arises from the map `mp` that stores the frequency of each substring of length `k`. In the worst case, there could be `n/k` unique substrings, so the map would require space proportional to `n/k`.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the minimum number of operations required to make the string `k-periodic`. By breaking the string into substrings of length `k` and counting the frequency of each substring, the problem is reduced to finding the most frequent substring and calculating how many changes are needed to make all substrings identical to the most frequent one. The time complexity of the solution is linear in terms of the size of the string, and the space complexity is proportional to the number of unique substrings, making this approach both time and space efficient.
