### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, and two integers `left` and `right`, count the number of contiguous subarrays where the maximum element is between `left` and `right` (inclusive).

### Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `ans`: To store the final count of valid subarrays.
   - `dp`: To count the number of valid subarrays ending at the current position.
   - `prv`: To keep track of the last position where an element greater than `right` was found.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - For each element in `nums`, check:
     - If the element is less than `left`, add the count of subarrays ending at the current position (`dp`) to `ans`.
     - If the element is greater than `right`, reset `dp` to 0 and update `prv` to the current index.
     - If the element is between `left` and `right` (inclusive), calculate the number of subarrays that can end at this element by using the difference between the current index and `prv`, then add this count to `ans`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, return the total count stored in `ans`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method for counting subarrays.
    - `int numSubarrayBoundedMax(vector<int>& nums, int left, int right)`: Implements the logic to count valid subarrays.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `nums`: A vector of integers representing the array.
        - `left`: The lower bound for the maximum value in the subarrays.
        - `right`: The upper bound for the maximum value in the subarrays.
      - **Returns**: The count of subarrays where the maximum element is within the bounds.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. Each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only a constant amount of extra space is used for variables.
