### Problem Statement
The problem involves counting the number of valid ways to deliver `n` orders, where each order consists of a unique food item that needs to be picked up and delivered. The constraints of the problem state that:
- Each order can only be delivered after it has been picked up.
- The pickup and delivery of orders must occur in such a way that the order of pickups and deliveries maintains the sequence of the orders.

For example, if you have 3 orders, denoted as 1, 2, and 3, you can pick them up in any order, but you must deliver them following the rule that an order can only be delivered after it has been picked up.

### Approach
To solve this problem, we can utilize combinatorial mathematics. The key insight is that the number of valid sequences for picking up and delivering `n` orders can be represented using a specific formula:
- For each order `i`, there are `2 * i - 1` positions to place its delivery after its pickup, as there will be `i` pickups before it and `i-1` deliveries already completed. 
- The total number of sequences can be calculated iteratively using the formula:
  \[
  \text{countOrders}(n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i
  \]
This accounts for both the ways to pick up and deliver the orders while maintaining the constraints.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countOrders(int n) {
        long res = 1; // Initialize result variable to store the count
        int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7; // Define modulo value to prevent overflow
        // Iterate from 1 to n to compute the total valid orderings
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
            res = (res * (2 * i - 1) * i) % mod; // Update result using the derived formula
        
        return (int) res; // Return the final result as an integer
    }
};
```

1. **Initialization**: 
   - A variable `res` is initialized to `1`, which will store the cumulative product of valid order counts.
   - A variable `mod` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is a common modulus used in programming contests to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.

2. **Iterating Through Orders**: 
   - A `for` loop runs from `1` to `n`, representing each order:
     - In each iteration, the result `res` is updated by multiplying it with the current order's contribution to valid sequences, calculated as `(2 * i - 1) * i`.
     - The modulo operation is applied to keep `res` within bounds.

3. **Returning the Result**: 
   - Finally, the function returns `res` cast to an integer, which is the total number of valid ways to arrange the pickup and delivery of `n` orders.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n)\) because we iterate through each order exactly once to compute the total number of valid sequences.
  
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are only using a few integer variables to store results and counts, independent of the size of `n`.

### Conclusion
The `countOrders` method provides an efficient solution to the problem of counting valid pickup and delivery sequences for `n` orders by leveraging combinatorial mathematics. The approach ensures that the solution runs in linear time, making it suitable for large inputs. This method highlights the power of mathematical formulas in solving combinatorial problems efficiently, allowing for concise and clear code that adheres to the constraints given.

This detailed explanation serves as an educational resource for understanding how to approach combinatorial problems and the mathematical foundations that can simplify complex counting scenarios. The implementation illustrates how to maintain clarity in code while ensuring optimal performance.
