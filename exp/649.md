### Problem Statement
In a game of Dota 2, there are two parties: Radiant and Dire. Players of these parties are represented by characters 'R' (for Radiant) and 'D' (for Dire) in a string. The players take turns based on their positions in the string. If a player from one party encounters a player from the other party, the player who comes first in the string defeats the other. The goal is to predict which party will ultimately win the game based on the initial arrangement of players.

### Approach
1. **Queues for Players**:
   - Use two queues to keep track of the indices of players from both parties. One queue (`q1`) for Radiant players ('R') and another queue (`q2`) for Dire players ('D').

2. **Simulating Battles**:
   - While both queues are not empty, compare the indices of the players at the front of each queue.
   - The player with the smaller index defeats the other and the defeated player's index is pushed back into their respective queue with an increased value to represent the next round (by adding the total number of players).

3. **Determining the Winner**:
   - The process continues until one of the queues is empty. The remaining players in the queue determine the winning party.
   - If `q1` (Radiant) has players left, return "Radiant". If `q2` (Dire) has players left, return "Dire".

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create two queues to hold the indices of players for each party.
   - Populate the queues based on the input string.

2. **Battle Simulation**:
   - Use a loop to simulate the battles, comparing the indices of the front players in both queues.
   - After each battle, the winning player's index is modified and pushed back into the corresponding queue for future battles.

3. **Result Determination**:
   - After exiting the loop, check which queue is not empty and return the corresponding party's name.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the input string. Each player enters and exits the queue exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for the storage of the queues in the worst case where all players are from the same party.
