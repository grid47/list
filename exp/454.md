### Problem Statement
Given four integer arrays `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`, return the number of tuples `(i, j, k, l)` such that `A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l]` equals zero.

### Approach
1. **HashMap for Sum Pairs**:
   - Create a hashmap to store the frequency of sums of all possible pairs formed by elements from arrays `A` and `B`.

2. **Counting Complements**:
   - Iterate through all pairs formed by elements from arrays `C` and `D` to find complements that equal `- (C[k] + D[l])`. For each found complement in the hashmap, add its frequency to the result.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Populating the HashMap**:
   - Loop through each element `a` in array `A` and each element `b` in array `B` to calculate the sum `a + b`.
   - Store the count of each sum in the hashmap `mp`.

2. **Finding Complements**:
   - For each element `c` in array `C` and each element `d` in array `D`, calculate `- (c + d)`.
   - Check if this value exists in the hashmap `mp`. If it does, add the count of that complement to the result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2), where N is the size of the arrays. The two nested loops for calculating pair sums contribute to this complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for storing the sums in the hashmap.
