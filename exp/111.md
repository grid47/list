### Problem Statement
Find the minimum depth of a binary tree, defined as the shortest path from the root node to any leaf node.

### Approach
1. Use recursion to calculate the minimum depth of the left and right subtrees.
2. For each node:
   - If both left and right children exist, take the minimum depth of the two subtrees.
   - If only one child exists, take the depth of that subtree since the node isnâ€™t a leaf.
3. Add 1 to the minimum depth to account for the current node in the path.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 6**: If `root` is `NULL`, return 0 as the tree is empty.
- **Lines 8-9**: Recursively calculate the minimum depth for the left (`l`) and right (`r`) subtrees.
- **Line 11-13**: If both left and right children exist, return `1 + min(l, r)`.
- **Lines 15-17**: If only the left child exists, return `1 + l`.
- **Line 19**: If only the right child exists, return `1 + r`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(H)\), where \(H\) is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.
