### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` consisting of `n` elements where each element is either `0`, `1`, or `2`, sort the array in place so that all `0`s come first, followed by all `1`s, and all `2`s at the end.

### Approach
1. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use two pointers to efficiently sort the colors in one pass.
   - `i`: Pointer for the next position to place a `0`.
   - `j`: Pointer for the next position to place a `2`.
   - Iterate through the array with a third pointer `k`.

2. **Iterate through the array**:
   - If the current element `nums[k]` is `0`, swap it with the element at `i` and increment both `i` and `k`.
   - If the current element `nums[k]` is `2`, swap it with the element at `j` and decrement `j`. 
   - If the current element is `1`, just increment `k` without any swaps.

3. **Continue until `k` reaches the end of the array**:
   - The pointers will ensure that all `0`s are moved to the front, and all `2`s are pushed to the back.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: Start with pointers `i` at the beginning and `j` at the end of the array.
2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element:
     - Swap with `j` if it’s `2` and decrement `j`.
     - Swap with `i` if it’s `0` and increment `i`.
3. **End of sorting**: By the end of the loop, the array will be sorted as required.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array, as we make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \), since sorting is done in place without using extra space.
