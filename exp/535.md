### Problem Statement
Design a URL shortening service that allows for encoding a long URL into a short URL and decoding the short URL back into the original long URL.

### Approach
1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use two hash maps (`url_code` and `code_url`) to store the mapping between long URLs and their corresponding short codes, and vice versa.
   - Use a constant string `charset` that contains all valid characters for the short URL.

2. **Encoding Process**:
   - Generate a random 6-character code from `charset` using `random_device`.
   - Check if the long URL is already present in `url_code`. If not, insert it with its generated code.
   - If the URL already exists, simply retrieve the corresponding code.
   - Return the full short URL by concatenating the base URL with the generated code.

3. **Decoding Process**:
   - Extract the 6-character code from the given short URL.
   - Check if this code exists in `code_url`. If it does, return the corresponding long URL.
   - If the code does not exist or if the URL format is invalid, return an empty string.

### Code Walk-through
- The constructor initializes the mappings and defines the character set.
- The `encode` function generates a unique code and returns the short URL.
- The `decode` function retrieves the original URL from the short code.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for both encoding and decoding operations on average, as hashmap operations are generally O(1).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of unique long URLs stored, as we need to keep a mapping for each URL.
