### Problem Statement
You are given two arrays, `fronts` and `backs`, representing the numbers on the front and back sides of some cards. Your task is to find the minimum number that is not present on both sides of the same card.

### Approach
1. **Identify Same Numbers**:
   - Use an unordered set to collect numbers that appear on both the front and back of the same card. This helps us quickly identify numbers we cannot choose.

2. **Find Minimum Valid Number**:
   - Initialize a variable `res` with a value larger than any possible card number (e.g., 3000).
   - Iterate over the `fronts` array and update `res` with the minimum number found that is not in the `same` set.
   - Repeat the same process for the `backs` array.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, return `res % 3000`, which ensures that if no valid number was found, it returns a value consistent with the problem constraints.

### Code Walk-through
- The `flipgame` function starts by filling the `same` set with numbers that appear on both sides of any card.
- Then, it searches for the minimum number not present in the `same` set from both the `fronts` and `backs` arrays.
- The result is returned, ensuring to handle cases where no valid number exists.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of cards. Each card is processed once to check and collect the valid numbers.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for storing numbers in the `same` set.

This approach efficiently finds the minimum valid number that can be chosen from the cards.
