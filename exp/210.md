### 🚀 Problem Statement

The challenge is to determine the order in which courses can be completed given a number of prerequisites. Each course may depend on other courses, and we need to find a valid sequence that respects these dependencies. If it's impossible to finish all courses due to a cycle in the prerequisites, we should return an empty list. If a valid order exists, return the sequence of courses.

---

### 🧠 Approach

To solve this problem, we will use **Topological Sorting** for a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. In simpler terms:
- Each course is a node.
- A directed edge from course `u` to course `v` indicates that course `v` is a prerequisite for course `u`.

Topological sorting arranges the courses such that for every directed edge `(u, v)`, course `u` appears before course `v`. If there’s a cycle in the graph, it means some courses depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete all courses. To handle this, we'll use **Kahn’s Algorithm** for topological sorting.

### Kahn's Algorithm Steps:
1. **Construct the graph** based on the prerequisite relationships.
2. **Track in-degrees** (number of incoming edges) for each course.
3. Use a **queue** to store courses with no prerequisites (in-degree = 0).
4. Process the queue by removing courses, updating their neighbors’ in-degrees, and adding neighbors to the queue when their in-degree becomes 0.
5. If we can process all courses, return the order; otherwise, return an empty list, indicating a cycle.

### 🔨 Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Let's break down the code to see how we can implement this approach:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findOrder(int n, vector<vector<int>>& pre) {
        vector<vector<int>> gph(n);   // Graph represented as an adjacency list
        vector<int> incnt(n, 0);       // Array to store in-degrees (prerequisite count)
```
- **gph**: A graph where each index `i` holds the list of courses that depend on course `i`.
- **incnt**: An array to track how many prerequisites each course has (its in-degree).

---

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < pre.size(); i++) {
            gph[pre[i][1]].push_back(pre[i][0]);  // Add directed edge from pre[i][1] to pre[i][0]
            incnt[pre[i][0]]++;                   // Increment the in-degree of pre[i][0]
        }
```
- We loop through the list of prerequisites and build the graph. For each prerequisite pair, we create a directed edge and update the in-degree of the dependent course.

---

```cpp
        queue<int> q;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if(incnt[i] == 0)  // If a course has no prerequisites, it can be taken first
                q.push(i);
        }
```
- **Queue (q)**: Stores courses that can be taken right away (courses with zero in-degree).
- We loop through all courses, adding those with zero prerequisites to the queue.

---

```cpp
        vector<int> ans;
        while(!q.empty()) {
            int y = q.front();  // Get the course from the front of the queue
            ans.push_back(y);    // Add it to the result list
            q.pop();
```
- **ans**: This vector will store the order in which courses can be taken.
- We process each course by adding it to the result and removing it from the queue.

---

```cpp
            for(auto x: gph[y]) {
                incnt[x]--;         // Decrease the in-degree of the dependent course
                if(incnt[x] == 0)   // If a dependent course now has no prerequisites, add it to the queue
                    q.push(x);
            }
        }
```
- For each course processed, we decrease the in-degree of its neighbors (dependent courses). If a neighbor's in-degree becomes zero, it’s added to the queue because it’s now available to be taken.

---

```cpp
        return ans.size() == n ? ans : vector<int>();  // If all courses are processed, return the result
    }
};
```
- Finally, we check if all courses have been processed. If the size of `ans` is equal to `n`, we return the order. If not, we return an empty list, indicating a cycle.

### 📊 Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(V + E)**, where:
  - `V` is the number of courses (`n`).
  - `E` is the number of prerequisite pairs (edges in the graph).
- Constructing the graph takes **O(E)** time. Processing each course and its dependencies in the queue takes **O(V + E)** time.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(V + E)**, where:
  - `V` is the number of courses (`n`).
  - `E` is the number of prerequisite pairs (edges in the graph).
- The adjacency list and in-degree array take **O(E)** and **O(V)** space, respectively.

### 🏁 Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the problem of determining the order in which courses can be completed while respecting prerequisites. By applying **Kahn’s Algorithm** for topological sorting, we ensure that the graph is processed in a valid order, and we can detect any cycles that would make completing all courses impossible.

#### Key Takeaways:
- **Topological Sorting** allows us to order courses in a way that respects their prerequisites.
- **Cycle Detection** ensures that if any courses are part of a circular dependency, we return an empty list.
- The approach is **efficient** with a time complexity of **O(V + E)** and works well even for large input sizes.
