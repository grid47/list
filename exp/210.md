### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n` representing the number of courses labeled from `0` to `n-1`, and a list of prerequisite pairs `pre`, where `pre[i] = [a, b]` indicates that to take course `a`, you must first complete course `b`. Return an array of the course order. If it is impossible to complete all courses, return an empty array.

### Approach
1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the directed graph of course dependencies.
   - `gph`: A vector of vectors where `gph[i]` contains all courses that depend on course `i`.
   - `incnt`: A vector that counts the number of prerequisites (incoming edges) for each course.

2. **Building the Graph**: 
   - Iterate through the prerequisites list and fill in `gph` and `incnt`.

3. **Topological Sorting**:
   - Use a queue to manage courses that can be taken (those with no remaining prerequisites).
   - For each course taken, reduce the incoming count of its dependent courses. If any dependent course's incoming count reaches zero, add it to the queue.

4. **Check Completion**: After processing, if the number of courses added to the result is equal to `n`, return the result; otherwise, return an empty array.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 3-4**: Initialize the graph and incoming count vectors.
- **Line 5-8**: Build the graph by populating `gph` and `incnt`.
- **Line 10-12**: Initialize the queue with courses that have zero prerequisites.
- **Line 13-21**: Process the queue, adding courses to the answer and updating the incoming counts of dependent courses.
- **Line 22**: Check if all courses have been accounted for and return the result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n + e)\), where \(n\) is the number of courses and \(e\) is the number of prerequisite pairs. Each edge and node is processed once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n + e)\) for the graph representation and the incoming count array.
