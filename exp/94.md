### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to perform an **inorder traversal** of a binary tree. In an inorder traversal, we visit the nodes in the following order:
1. Left subtree
2. Root node
3. Right subtree

For example, given a binary tree like:

```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \
   4   5
```

The inorder traversal of this tree would be: `[4, 2, 5, 1, 3]`.

The task is to return the list of node values in this order.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can use an **iterative approach** with a stack to simulate the recursive process of inorder traversal. While recursive approaches use the system’s call stack, the iterative approach makes use of an explicit stack data structure.

In the inorder traversal, we need to:
- Visit the left subtree first, then the node itself, and then the right subtree.
- The key challenge is that we need to ensure that after visiting the left subtree, we can backtrack to the root and then visit the right subtree. A stack can help manage this traversal process.

#### Steps:
1. Start at the root node of the tree.
2. Use a stack to remember nodes to visit. While there are nodes to visit:
   - Traverse down the left subtree, pushing nodes onto the stack.
   - Once the leftmost node is reached (i.e., `root == NULL`), pop the stack to visit the node and then move to its right child.
3. Repeat until all nodes have been visited.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize the Stack and Result Vector

```cpp
vector<int> nodes;
stack<TreeNode*> todo;
```

- `nodes` is a vector that will store the result of the inorder traversal.
- `todo` is a stack that will hold the nodes yet to be visited.

#### Step 2: While Loop for Traversing the Tree

```cpp
while (root || !todo.empty()) {
    while (root) {
        todo.push(root);
        root = root->left;
    }
```

- The outer `while` loop continues as long as there are nodes to be processed (`root != NULL`) or there are nodes in the stack (`!todo.empty()`).
- The inner `while` loop traverses the leftmost path of the tree, pushing nodes onto the stack as it goes. This is analogous to going as deep as possible down the left side of the tree.
- Once we reach a node with no left child (`root == NULL`), the inner loop stops, and we begin to backtrack by popping the stack.

#### Step 3: Process the Current Node

```cpp
root = todo.top();
todo.pop();
nodes.push_back(root->val);
```

- Now that we've reached a node where the left subtree has been fully explored (or there was no left child), we process the current node by:
  - Popping the top node from the stack.
  - Adding the node's value to the `nodes` vector.

#### Step 4: Move to the Right Subtree

```cpp
root = root->right;
```

- After processing the current node, we move to its right child, if it exists. If there’s no right child, `root` becomes `NULL`, and the algorithm backtracks using the stack.

#### Step 5: Return the Result

```cpp
return nodes;
```

- After the traversal is complete, the `nodes` vector contains the node values in the correct inorder sequence. We return this vector as the final result.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node exactly once during the traversal, and each operation (push and pop from the stack) takes constant time, leading to a total time complexity of **O(n)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree. In the worst case, the tree might be skewed (like a linked list), and the height of the tree could be `n`. In this case, the space complexity would be **O(n)** due to the stack storing nodes along the path from the root to the leaf.
- In a balanced tree, the height would be **O(log n)**, and thus the space complexity would be **O(log n)**.

### Conclusion

The iterative approach to performing an inorder traversal using a stack is efficient and avoids the potential pitfalls of recursion, such as deep recursion calls for very large trees. This approach allows us to traverse the binary tree in **O(n)** time with a space complexity of **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree. It works well even for trees with large depths and avoids any risk of stack overflow. By leveraging a stack, we maintain an explicit record of nodes to visit, ensuring that we process nodes in the correct inorder sequence, while also keeping track of the traversal state. This approach is optimal for many real-world scenarios where trees may not always be balanced, and deep recursion could be problematic.
