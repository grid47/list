### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values. In inorder traversal, nodes are visited in the following order: left subtree, root node, and right subtree.

### Approach
This solution uses an iterative approach with a stack to avoid recursion:
1. **Initialize Stack**: Use a stack `todo` to store nodes as we traverse down the left subtree.
2. **Inorder Traversal**:
   - **Left Subtree**: Traverse to the leftmost node, pushing each node to `todo` along the way.
   - **Visit Node**: Pop the top node from `todo`, add its value to the result list `nodes`, and move to its right subtree.
   - **Right Subtree**: Repeat the process by traversing down the left subtree of the current right node.
3. **End Condition**: The loop terminates when there are no more nodes left to visit (i.e., `root` is `NULL` and `todo` is empty).

### Code Walk-through
1. **Stack Initialization**: Initialize an empty stack `todo` and vector `nodes` to store results.
2. **Traversal Loop**:
   - Move to the leftmost node, pushing nodes to `todo`.
   - Visit each node by popping from `todo`, adding it to `nodes`, and moving to its right subtree.
3. **Result**: Once the traversal is complete, `nodes` contains the inorder traversal.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), for the stack in the worst case (unbalanced tree).
