### Problem Statement
Determine if two strings `s` and `t` are anagrams. Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters in the same frequency.

### Approach
This solution uses a frequency count with a fixed-size array of 26 elements (for lowercase English letters):

1. **Count Character Frequencies in `s`**: For each character in `s`, increment its corresponding index in the `ch` vector.
2. **Adjust Frequencies for `t`**: For each character in `t`, decrement its corresponding index in the `ch` vector.
3. **Check for Zero Balance**: If all counts in `ch` are zero, then `s` and `t` have the same character frequencies, and they are anagrams. Otherwise, they are not.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: Strings `s` and `t`.
- **Output**: `true` if `s` and `t` are anagrams, `false` otherwise.

1. Initialize a vector `ch` of size 26 with zeros to count characters.
2. For each character in `s`, increment its position in `ch`.
3. For each character in `t`, decrement its position in `ch`.
4. If any element in `ch` is not zero, return `false`; otherwise, return `true`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the longer string (`s` or `t`), since each character is processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as the `ch` vector has a fixed size of 26.

### Edge Cases
1. **Different Lengths**: If `s` and `t` have different lengths, they cannot be anagrams.
2. **Empty Strings**: Two empty strings are considered anagrams.
3. **Different Characters or Frequencies**: Handles cases where `s` and `t` have different character frequencies or characters.
