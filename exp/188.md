### Problem Statement
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day. You want to maximize your profit by performing at most `k` transactions. A transaction consists of buying and selling the stock.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
   - Use a 3D memoization table `memo` to store results for previously computed states to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The states are defined by:
     - `buy`: A boolean indicating whether you can buy on this day (`true` means you can buy).
     - `idx`: The current day index.
     - `cnt`: The count of transactions made so far.

2. **Recursion**:
   - Define a recursive function `dp` to explore two choices at each state:
     - **Skip the current day** and proceed to the next day.
     - **Buy the stock** if in a buying state or **sell the stock** if in a selling state.
   - Base cases:
     - If the count of transactions (`cnt`) reaches `k` or if all days are processed (`idx == prices.size()`), return 0 (no profit).
   - Compute the maximum profit possible from the two choices and store the result in the `memo` table.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the class `Solution`.
- **Line 2**: Declare a 3D array `memo` for memoization.
- **Line 3-4**: Define the recursive function `dp` with parameters: the number of transactions `k`, the prices array, a `buy` flag, the current index `idx`, and the count of transactions `cnt`.
- **Line 5-9**: Handle base cases and check the memoization table.
- **Line 10-14**: Calculate the result by either skipping the day or executing a buy/sell transaction.
- **Line 15**: Return the maximum profit stored in the `memo` table.
- **Line 17**: Define the `maxProfit` function that initializes the memoization table and calls the `dp` function.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(k \times n)\), where \(n\) is the number of days in the prices array, as we potentially explore all combinations of transactions and days.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(k \times n)\) for the memoization table, plus \(O(n)\) for the recursion stack in the worst case.
