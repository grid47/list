### Problem Statement

The problem is to find the maximum profit you can achieve from at most `k` transactions, given an array of stock prices `prices[]`. Each transaction consists of buying and selling the stock once. You can perform at most `k` transactions. The objective is to maximize the profit while adhering to the transaction limit.

#### Example:
- Given prices = `[2, 4, 1]` and `k = 2`, the maximum profit would be `2` by buying at 2 and selling at 4.
- Given prices = `[3, 2, 6, 5, 0, 3]` and `k = 2`, the maximum profit would be `7`.

### Approach

The problem requires finding the best way to buy and sell stocks under the constraint of `k` transactions. A brute force approach would involve trying every possible combination of transactions, but this would lead to inefficient time complexity. Instead, we can use dynamic programming (DP) to optimize this process.

In this solution, we use **memoization** to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations, making the approach more efficient. The idea is to recursively explore both options at each step: buying or not buying a stock and selling or not selling it, while tracking the number of transactions (`cnt`) and ensuring that we don't exceed `k`.

### Key Concepts:
1. **State Representation**: The state is represented by the current index in the `prices` array, whether we are in the "buy" phase or the "sell" phase, and the number of transactions performed so far.
2. **Memoization**: Memoization is used to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant work. This optimizes the recursion by storing previously computed results.
3. **Recursive Transition**: The recursion explores two possible transitions:
   - Skip the current day.
   - Buy the stock or sell the stock, depending on the current phase (`buy` or `sell`).

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. Function Signature:
```cpp
int memo[2][1001][100];
```
- A 3D memoization array is defined. The first dimension (`2`) is for whether we are in a buying or selling phase. The second dimension (`1001`) tracks the current day (index) in the `prices` array. The third dimension (`100`) tracks the number of transactions performed so far.

#### 2. `dp` Function:
```cpp
int dp(int k, vector<int>& prices, int buy, int idx, int cnt) {
```
- The recursive function `dp` is called with the parameters:
  - `k`: The maximum number of transactions allowed.
  - `prices`: The array of stock prices.
  - `buy`: A boolean flag to indicate whether we are in the buying phase (`1` for buy, `0` for sell).
  - `idx`: The current index in the `prices` array.
  - `cnt`: The current number of transactions performed.

#### 3. Base Case:
```cpp
if(cnt == k || idx == prices.size()) {
    return 0;
}
```
- If we've made `k` transactions or have iterated over all the prices, we return `0` because no further profit can be made.

#### 4. Memoization Check:
```cpp
if(memo[buy][idx][cnt] != -1) return memo[buy][idx][cnt];
```
- If the result has already been computed for the current state (`buy`, `idx`, `cnt`), we return the stored result from `memo` to avoid redundant calculations.

#### 5. Recursive Transitions:
```cpp
int res = dp(k, prices, buy, idx + 1, cnt);
```
- This line represents the option where we skip the current day and move to the next day (`idx + 1`), without making a transaction.

```cpp
if(buy) {
    res = max(res, -prices[idx] + dp(k, prices, false, idx + 1, cnt));
} else {
    res = max(res, prices[idx] + dp(k, prices, true, idx + 1, cnt + 1));            
}
```
- If we're in the "buy" phase (`buy == 1`), we attempt to buy the stock on the current day, and the next state will be the "sell" phase (`buy == 0`).
- If we're in the "sell" phase (`buy == 0`), we attempt to sell the stock, and the next state will be the "buy" phase (`buy == 1`) with the transaction count incremented by 1 (`cnt + 1`).
- The maximum profit is calculated by comparing both options: either skipping the day or performing a buy/sell transaction.

#### 6. Return Memoized Result:
```cpp
return memo[buy][idx][cnt] = res;
```
- After computing the maximum profit for the current state, we store the result in the `memo` array and return it.

#### 7. `maxProfit` Function:
```cpp
int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
    memset(memo, -1, sizeof(memo));
    return dp(k, prices, true, 0, 0);
}
```
- The `maxProfit` function initializes the `memo` array to `-1` (indicating uncomputed states).
- It then calls the recursive `dp` function starting from the first day (`idx = 0`), with `buy = true` (indicating we are allowed to buy on the first day), and `cnt = 0` (indicating no transactions have been made).

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: O(k * n)**, where `n` is the number of days in the `prices` array, and `k` is the maximum number of allowed transactions. The dynamic programming approach uses memoization to ensure each state is computed only once. The recursion explores `k * n` unique states, where each state corresponds to a specific combination of transaction count (`cnt`), day index (`idx`), and whether we're buying or selling (`buy`).

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity: O(k * n)**, which is the space used by the memoization table (`memo[2][1001][100]`), storing results for all unique combinations of `k`, `idx`, and `buy`.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the maximum profit achievable with at most `k` transactions using dynamic programming and memoization. By breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems and storing intermediate results, the solution avoids redundant calculations and achieves optimal performance.

#### Key Highlights:
- **Efficient Solution**: The solution is optimized with **O(k * n)** time complexity.
- **Memoization**: The use of memoization ensures that we don't recompute the result for the same state multiple times, significantly improving efficiency.
- **Dynamic Programming**: The approach makes use of dynamic programming to explore all possible states of the stock prices and transactions.
- **Scalable**: This solution can scale to larger inputs, as it avoids brute-force exploration of all combinations.

This code provides a comprehensive and efficient approach to solving the problem of maximizing profit with at most `k` stock transactions.
