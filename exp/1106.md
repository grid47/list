### Problem Statement
The task is to evaluate a boolean expression given in a string format. The expression can consist of the following components:
- **Variables**: 't' for true and 'f' for false.
- **Operators**: 
  - `!` (not): negates the value of a boolean expression.
  - `&` (and): returns true only if all operands are true.
  - `|` (or): returns true if at least one operand is true.
- **Parentheses**: Used to group expressions.

The expression adheres to a format where the operator precedes its operands, which can be either boolean variables or other expressions enclosed in parentheses.

**Input:**
- A string `e` representing a boolean expression.

**Output:**
- A boolean value (`true` or `false`) representing the result of evaluating the expression.

### Approach
To evaluate the boolean expression, we can utilize a recursive approach:
1. **Base Case**: If the expression consists of a single character ('t' or 'f'), return its boolean value directly.
2. **Recursion**: For expressions with operators:
   - Handle the `!` operator by recursively evaluating the operand and negating the result.
   - For `&` (and) and `|` (or), iterate through the operands, evaluating each and combining their results based on the operator.
3. **Parsing**: Manage parentheses to correctly identify the boundaries of each sub-expression during evaluation.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Class Definition**: The `Solution` class encapsulates the method for evaluating boolean expressions.

   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
   ```

2. **Method Declaration**: The `parseBoolExpr` method is defined, taking a string `e` as its parameter.

   ```cpp
       bool parseBoolExpr(string e) {
   ```

3. **Base Case Handling**: The method checks if the expression consists of a single character and returns its corresponding boolean value.

   ```cpp
           if (e.size() == 1) return e == "t" ? true : false;
   ```

4. **Negation Handling**: If the expression starts with `!`, it evaluates the inner expression (excluding the surrounding parentheses) and negates the result.

   ```cpp
           if (e[0] == '!') return !parseBoolExpr(e.substr(2, e.size() - 3));
   ```

5. **Operator Identification**: The code determines whether the primary operator is `&` (and) or `|` (or) and initializes the result accordingly.

   ```cpp
           bool isAnd = e[0] == '&' ? true : false, res = isAnd;
   ```

6. **Iterating Through the Expression**: The code iterates through the string, keeping track of nested parentheses to correctly identify sub-expressions.

   ```cpp
           for (auto i = 2, j = 2, cnt = 0; res == isAnd && i < e.size(); ++i) {
               if (e[i] == '(') ++cnt;
               if (e[i] == ')') --cnt;      
   ```

7. **Expression Evaluation**: When a complete operand (sub-expression) is identified (either when reaching a comma at the top level or the end of the string), it recursively evaluates that sub-expression and updates the result.

   ```cpp
               if (i == e.size() - 1 || (e[i] == ',' && cnt == 0)) {
                   if (isAnd) res &= parseBoolExpr(e.substr(j, i - j));
                   else res |= parseBoolExpr(e.substr(j, i - j));
                   j = i + 1;  // Update starting index for the next operand
               }
           }
   ```

8. **Return Result**: The final result of the evaluated expression is returned.

   ```cpp
           return res;
       }
   };
   ```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the algorithm is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string representing the boolean expression. The recursion processes each character and sub-expression at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the call stack used by the recursion and the potential storage of substrings during evaluation.

### Conclusion
The provided C++ code efficiently evaluates a boolean expression formatted as a string by leveraging recursion and systematic parsing. The algorithm's design handles various operators and nested expressions through careful iteration and condition checking.

By using recursive calls to evaluate each part of the expression, the solution elegantly navigates the complexities of operator precedence and operand boundaries. This approach not only ensures correctness but also showcases the effectiveness of recursive strategies in solving problems related to parsing and evaluation of structured data formats.

In summary, this code serves as an excellent example of how to implement a recursive parser for boolean expressions, providing valuable insights into both algorithmic design and programming techniques suitable for tackling similar problems.
