### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find the **length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS)** from an array of integers `nums`, with the added condition that the difference between any two consecutive elements in the subsequence must not exceed `k`. 

The goal is to compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence where the values are constrained by this difference limit (`k`). This problem can be tackled efficiently using segment trees and dynamic programming.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we use a **segment tree** (with lazy propagation) to store the maximum LIS length possible for each value in the array up to a given point. We process each element of the array and use the segment tree to dynamically calculate the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) that ends at each number.

#### Key Insights:

1. **Segment Tree for Efficient Range Queries**: We need to perform range queries to find the longest increasing subsequence for values in a given range. A segment tree allows us to perform these queries and updates in logarithmic time.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Segment Tree**: For each number in the array `nums[i]`, we want to find the longest increasing subsequence that ends at that number. This is done by querying the segment tree for the longest subsequence in the range `[max(0, nums[i] - k), nums[i] - 1]`, and then updating the segment tree with the result for `nums[i]`.

3. **Updating the Segment Tree**: For each number `nums[i]`, we update the segment tree with the maximum length of the subsequence that ends at `nums[i]`. This helps to maintain the LIS length for all subsequences up to each number.

4. **Final Result**: After processing all elements of the array, the maximum value stored in the segment tree will represent the length of the longest increasing subsequence that satisfies the given condition.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Segment Tree Class (`MxSegT`)

1. **Constructor (`MxSegT`)**: 

```cpp
MxSegT(int n) {
    this-> n = n;
    int k = (int)(ceil(log2(n)));
    int sz = 2 * (int)pow(2, k) - 1;
    tree.resize(sz, 0);
}
```

- This initializes the segment tree. The constructor takes the size `n` and calculates the necessary size for the segment tree, which will be at most `2 * 2^k - 1` where `k` is the height of the segment tree.
- We initialize all elements of the segment tree with 0, as initially, no subsequences are processed.

2. **Max Value Query (`mx_val`)**:

```cpp
int mx_val() {
    return tree[0];
}
```

- This function returns the root value of the segment tree, which represents the maximum LIS length in the entire array.

3. **Update Function (`update`)**:

```cpp
void update(int val, int i) { write(0, val, i, 0, n - 1); }
```

- This function is used to update the segment tree with a new LIS length value for index `i`. It calls the `write` function to perform the actual update in the tree.

4. **Recursive Write Function (`write`)**:

```cpp
void write(int root, int val, int pos, int wL, int wR) {
    if(pos < wL || pos > wR) {
        return;
    }
    if(wL == wR) {
        tree[root] = max(val, tree[root]);
        return;
    }
    int mid = (wL + wR) / 2;
    write(2 * root + 1, val, pos, wL, mid);
    write(2 * root + 2, val, pos, mid + 1, wR);
    tree[root] = max(tree[2 * root + 1], tree[2 * root + 2]);
}
```

- This recursive function updates the tree at the appropriate position (`pos`) and propagates the updated value through the segment tree.
- The segment tree stores the maximum LIS length in each range, so the value is updated using the `max` function.
  
5. **Query Function (`query`)**:

```cpp
int query(int l, int r) { return read(0, l, r, 0, n - 1); }
```

- This function queries the segment tree for the maximum LIS length in the range `[l, r]`. It calls the `read` function to perform the actual query.

6. **Recursive Read Function (`read`)**:

```cpp
int read(int root, int l, int r, int wL, int wR) {
    if(l <= wL && r >= wR) return tree[root];
    if(wR < l || wL > r) {
        return INT_MIN;
    }
    int mid = (wL + wR) / 2;
    return max(read(2 * root + 1, l, r, wL, mid),
               read(2 * root + 2, l, r, mid + 1, wR));
}
```

- This function recursively reads the segment tree to find the maximum LIS length within the given range `[l, r]`.

#### Main Solution (`lengthOfLIS`)

```cpp
int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    MxSegT tree = MxSegT(1e5 + 1);
    int n = nums.size();
    for(int x: nums) {
        int low = max(0, x - k);
        int cur = 1 + tree.query(low, x - 1);
        tree.update(cur, x);
    }
    return tree.mx_val();
}
```

- **Tree Initialization**: A segment tree is initialized with a size large enough to accommodate the values in `nums` (with an upper bound of `1e5 + 1`).
  
- **Processing Each Element**:
  - For each number `x` in `nums`, we calculate the range `[max(0, x - k), x - 1]` and query the segment tree to find the maximum LIS length within that range. This gives us the length of the longest increasing subsequence that can end at `x`.
  - We then update the segment tree with the new subsequence length for `x`.

- **Final Result**: The maximum LIS length is stored in the root of the segment tree (`tree.mx_val()`), which is returned as the result.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Segment Tree Operations**: Both updates and queries on the segment tree take **O(log n)** time, where `n` is the size of the segment tree.
- **Processing Each Element**: We process each element in `nums`, and for each element, we perform one query and one update. Therefore, the total time complexity is **O(n log n)**, where `n` is the size of the input array `nums`.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Segment Tree Storage**: The space required to store the segment tree is **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the input array.
- **Overall Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the solution is **O(n)** due to the segment tree and the input array.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) under the given constraint using a segment tree to store and update the maximum subsequence length. The time complexity of **O(n log n)** ensures that the solution can handle large inputs efficiently. The key idea is to leverage a segment tree to dynamically maintain and query the LIS lengths for all elements in the array, optimizing the process of finding the longest subsequence with constraints on the differences between consecutive elements.
