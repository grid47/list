### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to perform a certain number of operations on an array `nums` such that all elements in the array can be grouped into sets of 3. The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve this. The operation consists of selecting three identical elements and grouping them together. If any number cannot be grouped into a set of three, we should return `-1`.

For example, given the input array:
```cpp
nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
```
We can form one group of three `1`s, and two groups of two `2`s and one `3`. Hence, the solution is to count how many operations (groupings of 3 identical elements) are required to make the array contain only complete groups.

### Approach

The approach to solving this problem revolves around counting how many times each element appears in the array. Using a frequency map (hashmap or `unordered_map`), we can track how many occurrences each number has. Based on these frequencies, we can determine how many complete groups of three can be formed and how many leftover elements remain after grouping.

Key observations:
1. If an element appears only once, it cannot be part of any group of three, so the result should immediately be `-1`.
2. For each element, we can calculate the number of complete groups of three (`cnt / 3`) and any leftover elements (`cnt % 3 > 0`). 
3. If there are leftover elements, we will need an additional operation to handle them.

By iterating over the frequency map, we can compute the total number of required operations.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Count Element Frequencies

```cpp
unordered_map<int, int> m;
for (int n : nums)
    ++m[n];
```

- We first create an `unordered_map<int, int> m` to store the frequency of each number in the array `nums`.
- The loop `for (int n : nums)` iterates over each element in the array `nums`, and `++m[n]` increments the count for each number in the map.

#### Step 2: Initialize Result Variable

```cpp
int res = 0;
```

- The variable `res` is initialized to 0. This will store the total number of operations needed to group all elements into sets of three.

#### Step 3: Process Each Elementâ€™s Frequency

```cpp
for (auto [_, cnt] : m) {
    if (cnt == 1)
        return -1;
    res += cnt / 3 + (cnt % 3 > 0);
}
```

- We loop over the frequency map `m` using the `for (auto [_, cnt] : m)` syntax, which destructures the map into key-value pairs (`_` is used for the key because it's not needed).
- If the count of any element is `1`, it is impossible to form a group of three with that element. In this case, the function returns `-1` immediately.
- For elements that have a count greater than 1:
  - We calculate `cnt / 3` to find how many complete sets of three can be made.
  - We add `cnt % 3 > 0` to account for any leftover elements that would need one additional operation to form a group of three (even if it is not a complete group).
- We accumulate this in `res`, which represents the total number of operations required.

#### Step 4: Return the Result

```cpp
return res;
```

- After processing all elements in the frequency map, the function returns `res`, which is the total number of operations needed.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:

**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
```

1. **Step 1: Count Frequencies**
   - Frequency map: `m = {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}`
   
2. **Step 2: Initialize Result**
   - `res = 0`

3. **Step 3: Process Frequencies**
   - For `1` (count 3): 
     - `3 / 3 = 1` group, no remainder.
     - `res += 1`
   - For `2` (count 2):
     - `2 / 3 = 0` complete groups, `2 % 3 = 2`, so one leftover group.
     - `res += 1` (one additional operation for leftover)
   - For `3` (count 1):
     - Since count is `1`, it is impossible to form a group of three.
     - `return -1`

**Output:**
```cpp
-1
```

#### Example 2:

**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
```

1. **Step 1: Count Frequencies**
   - Frequency map: `m = {1: 3, 2: 3}`

2. **Step 2: Initialize Result**
   - `res = 0`

3. **Step 3: Process Frequencies**
   - For `1` (count 3):
     - `3 / 3 = 1` group, no remainder.
     - `res += 1`
   - For `2` (count 3):
     - `3 / 3 = 1` group, no remainder.
     - `res += 1`
   
**Output:**
```cpp
2
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array. This is because we iterate over the array once to populate the frequency map and then iterate over the map to calculate the result. Since the number of distinct elements in the map is at most the size of the array, the overall complexity is linear.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(n)** in the worst case. This is due to the space used by the frequency map `m`, which stores the count of each element in the array. In the worst case, where all elements in the array are distinct, the space used by the map is proportional to the size of the input array.

### Conclusion

This solution is efficient and straightforward, utilizing a frequency map to count the occurrences of each element and determine how many complete groups of three can be formed. The greedy approach of counting leftover elements ensures that no unnecessary operations are performed. The algorithm runs in linear time, making it well-suited for large input sizes. The space complexity is also linear, making the solution both time and space efficient.
