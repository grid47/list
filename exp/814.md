### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, prune it by removing all subtrees that contain only nodes with the value `0`. Return the pruned tree.

### Approach
1. **Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The function uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree.
   - For each node, recursively prune the left and right subtrees.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If the current node (`root`) is `NULL`, return `NULL`.
   - After pruning, check if the current node is a leaf (both left and right children are `NULL`) and its value is `0`. If so, return `NULL` to prune this node.

3. **Return Condition**:
   - If the current node is not a leaf with a value of `0`, return the node itself (it should remain in the pruned tree).

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to prune the binary tree.
    - `TreeNode* pruneTree(TreeNode* root)`: Main function to prune the tree.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `root`: A pointer to the root of the binary tree.
      - **Returns**: A pointer to the pruned tree.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, as we must visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where `h` is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), this can go up to O(n).
