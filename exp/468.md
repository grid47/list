### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to determine whether a given query string is a valid IPv4 address, a valid IPv6 address, or neither. An IPv4 address is a 32-bit address written as four decimal numbers, separated by periods, and each number must be between 0 and 255. An IPv6 address is composed of eight groups of four hexadecimal characters, separated by colons.

### Approach

We can break the solution into the following steps:
1. **Identify the Type of IP Address**: First, we determine whether the query string is an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address based on the presence of periods (`.`) or colons (`:`).
   - If the string contains periods, it's likely an IPv4 address.
   - If the string contains colons, it's likely an IPv6 address.
   
2. **Validate the IPv4 Address**: If the string is identified as an IPv4 address, we validate it by checking the format and constraints:
   - The address must consist of four parts, each part being a number between 0 and 255.
   - Each part must not have leading zeros, except when the part is exactly "0".
   - The part must be a valid integer and not exceed 255.

3. **Validate the IPv6 Address**: If the string is identified as an IPv6 address, we validate it by ensuring:
   - The address must consist of exactly eight groups, each with 1 to 4 hexadecimal characters (letters `a-f`, `A-F` and digits `0-9`).
   - Each group must not contain anything other than valid hexadecimal characters.

4. **Return the Result**: Based on the checks, we return:
   - "IPv4" if the query string is a valid IPv4 address.
   - "IPv6" if the query string is a valid IPv6 address.
   - "Neither" if it is neither valid IPv4 nor IPv6.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initial Check for `.` or `:`

```cpp
for(char ch: queryIP) {
    if (ch == '.') {
        if(checkIPv4(queryIP))
            return "IPv4";
        return "Neither";
    } else if (ch == ':') {
        if(checkIPv6(queryIP))                
            return "IPv6";
        return "Neither";
    }
}
return "Neither";
```

- The code begins by iterating through each character of the `queryIP` string.
- If a period (`.`) is found, it checks whether the string is a valid IPv4 address by calling the `checkIPv4` method.
- If a colon (`:`) is found, it checks whether the string is a valid IPv6 address by calling the `checkIPv6` method.
- If neither a period nor a colon is found, the function returns `"Neither"`.

#### Step 2: Checking for a Valid IPv4 Address

```cpp
bool checkIPv4(string s) {
    s += '.';  // Append a period to ensure last part is processed
    stringstream ss(s);  // Convert string to stringstream for easier parsing
    string str;
    int n_mark = 0;
    
    while(getline(ss, str, '.')) {
        if(str.size() < 1 || str.size() > 3) return false;
        for(char ip: str) {
            if(ip<='9' && ip >= '0') continue;
            else return false;
        }
        if((str[0] == '0' && str[1] == '0') || (str[0] == '0' && str[1] >= '0' && str[1] <= '9'))
            return false;
        if(stoi(str) > 255) return false;
        n_mark++;
    }
    if(n_mark != 4) return false;
    return true;
}
```

- The `checkIPv4` function adds a period at the end of the input string to ensure the final part of the address is processed.
- The function uses a `stringstream` to split the string by periods (`.`) into individual parts.
- Each part is validated:
  - The part must be between 1 and 3 characters long.
  - The part must contain only numeric characters.
  - No part can have leading zeros unless it's "0".
  - The integer value of each part must not exceed 255.
- The function ensures that there are exactly four parts, returning `true` if all conditions are met and `false` otherwise.

#### Step 3: Checking for a Valid IPv6 Address

```cpp
bool checkIPv6(string s) {
    s += ':';  // Append a colon to ensure last part is processed
    stringstream ss(s);
    string str;
    int n_mark = 0;
    
    while(getline(ss, str, ':')) {
        if(str.size() < 1 || str.size() > 4)
            return false;
        for(char ip: str) {
            if((ip >= '0' && ip <= '9') || (ip >= 'a' && ip <= 'f') || (ip>= 'A' && ip<='F'))
                continue;
            else return false;
        }
        n_mark++;
    }
    if(n_mark != 8) return false;
    return true;
}
```

- The `checkIPv6` function appends a colon to the string to ensure the last part is processed.
- The function uses a `stringstream` to split the string by colons (`:`) into individual parts.
- Each part is validated:
  - The part must be between 1 and 4 characters long.
  - Each character in the part must be a valid hexadecimal character (either a digit or a letter between `a-f` or `A-F`).
- The function ensures that there are exactly eight parts, returning `true` if all conditions are met and `false` otherwise.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **IPv4 Checking**: For an IPv4 address, the `checkIPv4` function processes the string in a linear pass and performs constant-time operations for each part. Therefore, its time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string.
- **IPv6 Checking**: Similarly, for an IPv6 address, the `checkIPv6` function processes the string in a linear pass, making its time complexity `O(n)`.
- The overall time complexity is dominated by the longest string to be checked, so it is `O(n)`.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is `O(1)` because the algorithm uses a fixed amount of extra space (mainly the stringstream and temporary variables), and the input size does not affect the space usage significantly.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the problem of validating whether a string is a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address. By systematically checking the format and constraints for both types of IP addresses, the solution is both time-efficient and easy to understand. It ensures that each address follows the required rules for valid IPv4 and IPv6 formats, returning the appropriate result for each case. The time complexity of `O(n)` makes it well-suited for handling long IP address strings, and the space complexity of `O(1)` ensures minimal memory usage.
