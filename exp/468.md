### Problem Statement
Given a string `queryIP`, determine if it is a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address. If it is valid, return "IPv4" or "IPv6". If it is neither, return "Neither".

### Approach
1. **Character Identification**:
   - Iterate through the characters in the `queryIP`. Check for the presence of `.` or `:` to determine if it's an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

2. **IPv4 Address Validation**:
   - Split the string by `.` and check the following:
     - The address must contain exactly 4 parts.
     - Each part must be between 1 to 3 characters long.
     - Each character must be a digit (`0-9`).
     - No part should start with `0` unless it is exactly `0`.
     - Each part should convert to an integer not exceeding `255`.

3. **IPv6 Address Validation**:
   - Split the string by `:` and check the following:
     - The address must contain exactly 8 parts.
     - Each part must be between 1 to 4 characters long.
     - Each character must be a hexadecimal digit (`0-9`, `a-f`, `A-F`).

### Code Walk-through
1. **Main Function**:
   - The function `validIPAddress` checks each character to determine if the input is an IPv4 or IPv6 address and calls the respective validation function.

2. **IPv4 Validation**:
   - The function `checkIPv4` uses a string stream to split the input and validates each part based on the conditions specified.

3. **IPv6 Validation**:
   - The function `checkIPv6` similarly uses a string stream to split the input and validates each part based on the conditions for IPv6 addresses.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `queryIP`, as each character is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a fixed amount of extra space for variables and the string stream.
