### Problem Statement

The task is to find the length of the optimal compressed representation of a given string `s` after deleting up to `k` characters. The compression of a substring consists of its characters followed by the count of consecutive occurrences, but the count should be represented in its minimal digit form (e.g., `2` for two occurrences, `10` for ten occurrences). 

The goal is to compute the shortest possible length of the compressed string after performing the specified deletions.

### Approach

To tackle this problem, we employ a dynamic programming approach, using a recursive strategy combined with memoization to optimize performance. The idea is to recursively explore different ways to compress the string while keeping track of how many characters we can still delete. The key components of this approach include:

1. **Recursive Function**: We define a recursive function `dp(idx, k)` that computes the minimum length of the compressed string starting from index `idx` and with `k` deletions remaining.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If `k < 0`, it indicates that we've attempted to delete more characters than allowed, so we return a large value (256 in this case) as a penalty.
   - If we have processed all characters (`idx >= n`) or if the remaining characters can be fully deleted with the remaining `k`, we return 0, as there would be nothing left to compress.

3. **Memoization**: To avoid redundant calculations, we store results of previously computed states in a memoization table `mem`.

4. **Character Frequency Count**: We maintain an array `frq` to count the frequency of each character in the substring being processed. This helps in determining how many characters can be compressed together.

5. **Computing Compressed Length**: For each position in the string, we iterate through potential end positions of substrings, updating the maximum frequency of characters and calculating the potential new compressed length.

6. **Updating Minimum Length**: We compute the minimum length of the compressed string based on the counts of characters in the substring, taking into account the allowed deletions.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here's a detailed breakdown of the code provided:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> mem; // Memoization table
    string s; // Input string
    int n; // Length of the string

    // Function to determine the length of the string representation of a number
    int len(int num) {
        return num == 1 ? 0 : num < 10 ? 1 : num < 100 ? 2 : 3;
    }
```
- We initialize a memoization table `mem` to store the results of previously computed states.
- The method `len(int num)` calculates the number of digits required to represent a number in its compressed form.

```cpp
    // Recursive function to compute the minimum compressed length
    int dp(int idx, int k) {
        if (k < 0) return 256; // If we exceed deletions, return a large value
        if (idx >= n || n - idx <= k) return 0; // If we've processed all characters or can delete all remaining characters, return 0
```
- The `dp` function checks the base cases for recursion.
- If `k` is negative, it returns a high penalty value.
- If we have processed all characters or can delete all remaining characters, it returns 0.

```cpp
        if (mem[idx][k] != -1) return mem[idx][k]; // Return cached result if already computed

        vector<int> frq(26, 0); // Frequency array for characters
        int ans = 256; // Initialize answer to a large value
        int most = 0; // Variable to track the maximum frequency of any character
```
- If the state has already been computed, we return the stored value.
- We initialize an array `frq` to keep track of character frequencies, set the answer `ans` to a large value, and initialize `most` to track the highest frequency of characters.

```cpp
        // Iterate over the substring starting from the current index
        for (int i = idx; i < n; i++) {
            most = max(most, ++frq[s[i] - 'a']); // Update the frequency of the current character
            ans = min(ans, 1 + len(most) + dp(i + 1, k - (i - idx + 1 - most))); // Calculate compressed length
        }

        return mem[idx][k] = ans; // Cache the result and return it
    }
```
- We iterate through the string starting from the current index to determine how to best compress the substring.
- The maximum frequency of any character is updated as we process each character.
- We calculate the compressed length for the substring and the remaining string after considering deletions, updating the answer accordingly.

```cpp
    int getLengthOfOptimalCompression(string s, int k) {
        n = s.length(); // Get the length of the string
        this->s = s; // Store the string in the class member
        mem.resize(n, vector<int>(k + 1, -1)); // Initialize memoization table
        return dp(0, k); // Start the recursive computation
    }
};
```
- The function `getLengthOfOptimalCompression` initializes the necessary variables and starts the recursive DP computation by calling `dp(0, k)`, indicating that we are starting from the first character with `k` deletions allowed.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2 \cdot k)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string and \(k\) is the maximum number of deletions allowed. The nested loops allow us to process substrings efficiently while considering the character frequencies.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is \(O(n \cdot k)\) due to the memoization table used to store results for different indices and counts of allowed deletions.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently determines the length of the optimal compressed representation of a string after making up to `k` deletions. By using dynamic programming and memoization, the algorithm efficiently explores the possible combinations of characters to compress while keeping track of the allowed deletions.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Dynamic Programming**: This approach leverages DP to minimize the computation by caching results and avoiding redundant calculations.
- **Character Frequency Tracking**: By maintaining a frequency count, the algorithm effectively determines the best way to compress substrings.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The implementation accounts for cases with maximum deletions or fully processed strings, ensuring robustness.

This method serves as an excellent example of applying dynamic programming to string manipulation problems, showcasing how to optimize performance while tackling complex problems in a structured manner.
