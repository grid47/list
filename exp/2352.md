### Problem Statement

The task requires us to find the number of pairs of rows and columns in a square grid that are identical. Specifically, given a grid of size `n x n`, we need to determine how many pairs of rows and columns have the exact same elements in the same order.

### Approach

To solve the problem, we need to iterate through each column of the grid, convert each column into a vector, and check how many rows match that column exactly. The problem can be approached in a structured manner by utilizing simple loops, making the solution both easy to understand and efficient.

### Optimized Approach Using Vector Matching

1. **Grid Structure**:  
   We are working with a 2D grid (a matrix), where each element is an integer. We need to compare rows with columns to find matching pairs. The key observation here is that a row and a column are considered equal if, for every index `i`, the element at `grid[row][i]` matches the element at `grid[i][col]`.

2. **Column Conversion**:  
   Instead of directly comparing rows with columns during the iteration, we first convert each column into a vector. This allows for a more straightforward comparison with the rows.

3. **Efficient Matching Using `count` Function**:  
   Once each column is converted into a vector, we can count how many times this vector (representing a column) appears in the grid's rows. By leveraging the `count` function from the C++ Standard Library, we can achieve this comparison efficiently.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables
```cpp
int n = grid.size();
int ans = 0;
```
- We first initialize the size of the grid `n`, which is the number of rows (and columns) in the square grid.  
- We also initialize a variable `ans` to 0, which will hold the count of the matching pairs of rows and columns.

#### Step 2: Iterate Over Columns
```cpp
for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
    vector<int> col;
    col.reserve(n);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        col.push_back(grid[i][c]);
}
```
- We loop over each column `c` (from 0 to `n-1`). For each column, we create an empty vector `col` that will hold the elements of that column.
- Using a nested loop, we traverse through each row of the grid, `grid[i][c]`, and add the elements of the current column to the vector `col`.

#### Step 3: Count Matching Rows
```cpp
ans += count(begin(grid), end(grid), col);
```
- After constructing the column as a vector, we use the `count` function to check how many times the column (now stored as a vector) exactly matches a row in the grid.
- The `count` function takes the beginning and end iterators of the grid's rows (`begin(grid)` and `end(grid)`) and the column vector `col`, and counts how many rows are identical to `col`. The result is added to the variable `ans`.

#### Step 4: Return the Answer
```cpp
return ans;
```
- Finally, after all columns are processed and matched with the rows, we return the result stored in `ans`, which represents the number of matching pairs of rows and columns.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is **O(n^2)**, where `n` is the size of the grid (i.e., the number of rows or columns in the grid). The reasoning is as follows:
1. **Column Conversion**: For each of the `n` columns, we create a vector and populate it by iterating through `n` rows. This operation takes **O(n)** time per column, leading to **O(n^2)** time for this step.
2. **Matching Rows**: For each of the `n` columns, we use the `count` function to check how many rows match the column. The `count` function also runs in **O(n)** time, leading to **O(n^2)** time for this step.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n^2)**.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the temporary vector `col` used to store each column. The space required for storing the entire grid is **O(n^2)**, but since the space used by the `col` vector is the only extra space allocated, the overall space complexity is **O(n)**.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the problem of counting identical row-column pairs in a grid using basic operations and vector manipulation. The time complexity is **O(n^2)**, which is optimal for this type of problem when using nested loops to compare rows and columns. The use of the `count` function from the C++ Standard Library simplifies the solution and improves code readability. The space complexity is minimal, at **O(n)**, as we only store a single column at a time. This approach ensures that the solution is both time-efficient and easy to implement.

The main idea behind the solution is straightforward: convert each column into a vector and compare it with the rows. This method ensures that we can accurately and efficiently count the number of matching pairs, even for larger grids.
