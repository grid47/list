### Problem Statement
Given a string `num`, you need to split it into the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence starts with any two numbers, and every subsequent number must be the sum of the previous two. You are required to return a vector containing the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

### Approach
1. **Recursive Backtracking**:
   - Implement a recursive function `split` that takes the current index, the result vector, and the original string as parameters.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the current index `idx` equals the length of the string and the result vector has at least three elements, return `true`.

3. **Loop through the String**:
   - Iterate through the string starting from the current index.
   - Handle leading zeros: if the first character of the current segment is '0' and the segment length is greater than 1, break the loop.
   - Convert the current substring to a long integer.
   - If the number exceeds `INT_MAX`, break the loop.
   
4. **Check Fibonacci Condition**:
   - If the result vector has less than 2 elements, or if the current number is the sum of the last two numbers in the result vector, add the number to the result vector and recursively call `split` for the next index.
   - If the recursive call returns `true`, propagate this success back. If not, remove the last added number (backtrack) and continue.

5. **Return Result**:
   - If no valid Fibonacci sequence can be formed, return an empty vector.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^N) in the worst case due to the exponential nature of recursive backtracking.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for the recursion stack and the result vector.
