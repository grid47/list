### Problem Statement

In this problem, we are given a target integer and a list of types, where each type is represented by two values:
1. `types[i][0]` represents the maximum number of times we can use a certain type.
2. `types[i][1]` represents the value contributed by using one instance of this type.

The task is to determine how many different ways we can sum up to the given target using the types provided, respecting the constraints on how many times each type can be used. The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Approach

The approach to solving this problem efficiently is to use **dynamic programming** (DP). The key insight is that this problem is a variation of the **bounded knapsack problem**, where we want to find the number of ways to reach a specific target using multiple items, each with a maximum count and a fixed value.

#### Steps:
1. **Define the State**:
   We define `dp(idx, hit)` as the number of ways to reach a target value `hit` using the first `idx` types.
   
2. **Base Case**:
   - If `idx == n` (we have considered all types), return `1` if the remaining target (`hit`) is `0` (we’ve successfully reached the target), otherwise return `0`.
   - If `hit == 0` (we’ve already reached the target), return `1`.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   For each type, we try all possible amounts of that type (from `0` to `types[idx][0]`). For each possible count, we check if it is feasible to use that many items without exceeding the remaining target (`hit`). If feasible, we recursively compute the number of ways to reach the new target.

4. **Memoization**:
   Since this is a recursive problem, overlapping subproblems will occur. To avoid recalculating the same results multiple times, we use **memoization** to store the results of subproblems in a 2D `memo` array.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   Since the number of ways can grow large, we take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow and adhere to the problem's constraints.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. **Initialization**:
```cpp
int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
int n;
vector<vector<int>> types, memo;
```
- `mod` is the modulo constant \(10^9 + 7\).
- `n` stores the number of types.
- `types` holds the types of items (each type is a pair: max count and value per item).
- `memo` is a 2D vector used for memoization to store intermediate results of subproblems.

#### 2. **DP Function**:
```cpp
int dp(int idx, int hit) {
    if(idx == n) return hit == 0 ? 1 : 0;
    if(hit == 0) return 1;
    if(memo[idx][hit] != -1) return memo[idx][hit];
    long ans = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i <= types[idx][0]; i++) {
        if(hit >= types[idx][1] * i) {
            ans = (ans + dp(idx + 1, hit - types[idx][1] * i)) % mod;
        }
    }
    return memo[idx][hit] = ans;
}
```
- **Base Case**: If we've considered all types (`idx == n`), we return `1` if the target is `0`, otherwise `0`.
- If the target `hit` is `0`, we return `1` because we've successfully found a way to reach the target.
- If the result for `dp(idx, hit)` has already been computed (i.e., `memo[idx][hit] != -1`), we return it directly to avoid recalculation.
- **Recursive Case**: We iterate over all possible numbers of the current type (`i` from `0` to `types[idx][0]`), checking if we can use `i` of the current type without exceeding the target `hit`. For each valid `i`, we recursively compute the number of ways to reach the remaining target (`hit - types[idx][1] * i`).
- The result for each recursive call is accumulated in `ans`, and we return the result modulo `mod`.

#### 3. **Main Function**:
```cpp
int waysToReachTarget(int target, vector<vector<int>>& types) {
    n = types.size();
    memo.resize(51, vector<int>(1001, -1)); // memoization table
    this->types = types; // store the types globally
    return dp(0, target); // start the DP from index 0 and target `target`
}
```
- We initialize the number of types `n` and the `memo` table with a size sufficient to store the results of subproblems. The table has dimensions `51 x 1001` because the problem constraints ensure that we will never have more than `50` types and the target value is at most `1000`.
- We call the `dp` function starting from index `0` and the given target.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- The function `dp(idx, hit)` is called for each combination of `idx` (from `0` to `n-1`) and `hit` (from `0` to `target`). 
- For each call, we iterate over all possible values of `i` (from `0` to `types[idx][0]`), which is at most `types[idx][0]`. In the worst case, we need to check all possible values for each type.
- Thus, the time complexity is \(O(n \times \text{target} \times \text{max\_types}[0])\), where `max_types[0]` is the largest number of times any type can be used. In the worst case, this can be \(O(n \times \text{target} \times \text{max\_count})\).

#### Space Complexity:
- We use a memoization table (`memo`) of size \(O(n \times \text{target})\) to store intermediate results. Thus, the space complexity is \(O(n \times \text{target})\).
- We also store the types in a 2D vector `types`, which takes \(O(n)\) space.

#### Overall Complexity:
- Time complexity: \(O(n \times \text{target} \times \text{max\_count})\)
- Space complexity: \(O(n \times \text{target})\)

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the problem using dynamic programming and memoization. By breaking down the problem into subproblems and using a DP table to store intermediate results, the solution avoids redundant calculations, ensuring that we can compute the number of ways to reach the target within the given constraints. The algorithm handles large inputs efficiently, with the complexity dependent on the number of types, the target value, and the maximum number of times each type can be used.
