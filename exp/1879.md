### Problem Statement

The objective of the problem is to find the minimum XOR sum that can be achieved by pairing elements from two integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`. An XOR sum is calculated by taking the bitwise XOR of each pair of elements from the two arrays and then summing these values. Each element from `nums1` must be paired with a unique element from `nums2`, and the task is to minimize this overall sum.

### Approach

To tackle this problem, we will use dynamic programming with memoization. The key ideas behind the approach are as follows:

1. **Recursive State Representation**: We will represent the state of our recursive function using two parameters: the current index in `nums1` (denoted as `idx`) and a bitmask (`mask`) that keeps track of which elements in `nums2` have already been paired.

2. **Base Case**: The recursion stops when all elements of `nums1` have been paired, at which point the function returns 0, indicating no further contributions to the sum.

3. **Memoization**: We will cache the results of the recursive calls in a memoization table to avoid redundant calculations. This significantly improves efficiency by preventing recalculations for the same state.

4. **Pairing Logic**: For each element in `nums1`, we will iterate through all elements in `nums2`. If an element in `nums2` has not yet been paired (as indicated by the bitmask), we compute the XOR with the current element in `nums1` and recursively call the function to handle the next index and updated mask.

5. **Finding the Minimum**: We maintain a running minimum of the XOR sums computed for all valid pairings.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Class Declaration**: The solution is encapsulated in a class named `Solution`.

   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
       vector<int> n1, n2;
   ```

2. **Memoization Array**: We define a 2D memoization array `memo` to store results for combinations of indices and masks. The dimensions are based on the number of elements in `nums1` and the possible bitmasks (up to \( 2^{14} \) since the maximum size is 14).

   ```cpp
       int memo[15][(1 << 14) - 1];
   ```

3. **Recursive Function**: The `dp` function is defined, which will compute the minimum XOR sum using the current index and mask.

   ```cpp
       int dp(int idx, int mask) {
           if(idx == n1.size()) return 0; // Base case
           if(memo[idx][mask] != -1) return memo[idx][mask]; // Memoization check
           int ans = INT_MAX; // Initialize the answer to maximum
   ```

4. **Iterate Over Possible Pairings**: For the current index, the function iterates through all elements in `nums2` to find valid pairings.

   ```cpp
           for(int i = 0; i < n1.size(); i++) {
               if((mask & (1 << i)) == 0) { // Check if nums2[i] is not used
                   ans = min(ans, (n1[idx] ^ n2[i]) + dp(idx + 1, mask + (1 << i)));
               }
           }
   ```

5. **Store Result in Memoization Table**: The computed minimum for the current state is stored in the memoization array.

   ```cpp
           return memo[idx][mask] = ans;
       }
   ```

6. **Main Function**: The `minimumXORSum` function initializes the arrays and calls the recursive `dp` function.

   ```cpp
       int minimumXORSum(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
           n1 = nums1;
           n2 = nums2;
           memset(memo, -1, sizeof(memo)); // Initialize memoization array
           return dp(0, 0); // Start recursion with index 0 and empty mask
       }
   ```

### Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is \( O(n^2 \times 2^n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. This complexity arises because we explore all combinations of elements with the recursive calls, while also considering all possible states represented by the bitmask. The space complexity is \( O(n \times 2^n) \) due to the memoization table.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the `minimumXORSum` function provides an efficient solution to the problem of finding the minimum XOR sum of pairs between two arrays. By leveraging dynamic programming with memoization, the algorithm avoids redundant calculations, ensuring that each state is computed only once.

This approach illustrates the effective use of bit manipulation and dynamic programming techniques to solve combinatorial optimization problems. The clear separation of concerns through recursive calls and memoization allows for a structured and maintainable implementation, making it suitable for competitive programming and algorithmic challenges.

By mastering such techniques, programmers can tackle a wide range of similar problems that require pairing or matching elements with specific constraints, enhancing their overall problem-solving skills in algorithm design and optimization. This solution stands as a robust example of how to efficiently approach complex combinatorial problems in programming contests and real-world applications.
