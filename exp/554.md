### Problem Statement
Given a wall represented as a 2D array, where each element is the width of the bricks in each row, the task is to find the least number of bricks that need to be crossed by a vertical line drawn from the top of the wall to the bottom.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - A vertical line can cross multiple bricks in each row. The goal is to minimize the number of bricks that the line crosses.
   - Each row of the wall can have different brick widths, and the position where the vertical line intersects can vary.

2. **Using a Hash Map to Track Edges**:
   - Iterate through each row of the wall and calculate the positions of the edges of the bricks.
   - For every edge position, keep a count of how many rows have that edge position using a hash map (`edge_freq`).

3. **Calculating Maximum Frequency**:
   - Determine the maximum frequency of any edge position across all rows. This value represents the maximum number of rows that can be aligned without crossing a brick.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The result is the total number of rows minus the maximum frequency, which gives the minimum number of bricks crossed by the vertical line.

### Code Walk-through
- The `leastBricks` function iterates over each row of the wall.
- For each brick in the row (except the last one), it calculates the cumulative edge position and updates the frequency in the hash map.
- Finally, it calculates the number of rows that need to be crossed and returns the result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the total number of bricks in all rows combined, since each brick width is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(M), where M is the number of unique edge positions tracked in the hash map.
