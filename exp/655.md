### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, print the tree in a 2D array format where each row represents a level of the tree, and each column represents the position of the nodes in that level. The structure should have empty strings for null nodes.

### Approach
1. **Height and Width Calculation**:
   - Calculate the height of the tree to determine the number of rows in the output.
   - Calculate the width of the tree to determine the number of columns in the output. The width is defined as `2^h - 1` where `h` is the height of the tree.

2. **2D Vector Initialization**:
   - Initialize a 2D vector (`ans`) with dimensions determined by the height and width, filled with empty strings.

3. **Recursive Tree Population**:
   - Use a helper function to fill the 2D vector with values from the tree nodes:
     - For each node, determine its position in the 2D vector based on its level and the current left and right boundaries.
     - Recursively call the helper function for the left and right children, adjusting the boundaries accordingly.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - The main function `printTree` initializes the dimensions and calls the helper function.

2. **Recursive Functionality**:
   - The `helper` function places the node value in the correct position and makes recursive calls for the left and right children, effectively filling in the tree's structure into the 2D vector.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, the filled 2D vector is returned.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed once to calculate height, width, and during the population of the 2D vector.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for the 2D vector and the recursion stack in the case of a skewed tree.
