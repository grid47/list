### Problem Statement

Given a tree represented as an integer array `parents` where `parents[i]` is the parent node of node `i`, the goal is to find the number of nodes that achieve the highest possible "score." The "score" of a node is calculated by multiplying the sizes of the subtrees of its children and the remaining nodes outside its subtree (if any). The task is to return the count of nodes that reach the maximum score.

### Approach

The solution builds a graph from the `parents` array, where each node `i` points to its children. Using a recursive helper function, it computes the subtree size for each node and calculates each node's score. After determining the score for each node, it counts how many nodes achieve the maximum score.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Class and Method Definition**: We define the class `Solution` and the main method `countHighestScoreNodes`, which takes the `parents` array as input and returns the count of nodes with the highest score.

    ```cpp
    class Solution {
    public:
        int countHighestScoreNodes(vector<int>& parents) {
    ```

2. **Tree Structure Setup**: We initialize `n` as the size of `parents` and create an adjacency list `g` to represent the tree. We then iterate over `parents` to build the tree structure, where each index `i` points to its children.

    ```cpp
    int n = parents.size();
    vector<vector<int>> g(n);
    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        g[parents[i]].push_back(i);
    ```

3. **Subtree Size Calculation**: We create a vector `size` to store the size of each node's subtree. Then, using a recursive helper function, `helper`, we calculate and store the subtree size for each node starting from the root (node `0`).

    ```cpp
    vector<int> size(n, 0);
    helper(0, g, size);
    ```

4. **Initialize Counters for Maximum Score and Count**: We initialize `cnt` to count nodes with the maximum score and `maxi` to store the maximum score found so far.

    ```cpp
    long long cnt = 0, maxi = 0;
    ```

5. **Calculate Scores for Each Node**: We iterate over each node and compute its score. The score `pro` starts with a base value of 1. The following operations are performed to compute the score for each node `i`:
   - Multiply `pro` by the size of each child subtree.
   - If there are nodes outside the subtree rooted at `i`, include their count as an additional factor in `pro`.

    ```cpp
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        long long pro = 1;
        pro = max(pro, (long long) n - size[i]);
        for(int node : g[i]) {
            pro = pro * size[node];
        }
    ```

6. **Update Maximum Score and Count**: After calculating the score for node `i`, we compare it with `maxi`:
   - If the current score `pro` is greater than `maxi`, update `maxi` and reset `cnt` to `1`.
   - If the score `pro` equals `maxi`, increment `cnt` by `1`.

    ```cpp
        if (pro > maxi) {
            maxi = pro;
            cnt = 1;
        }
        else if(pro == maxi) {
            cnt++;
        }
    }
    ```

7. **Return the Count of Nodes with Maximum Score**: After iterating through all nodes, `cnt` holds the number of nodes with the maximum score, which we return as the result.

    ```cpp
    return cnt;
    ```

8. **Helper Function to Compute Subtree Size**: The `helper` function recursively computes the size of each subtree by traversing the tree. For each node, it sums up the sizes of its children and returns the total size.

    ```cpp
    int helper(int src, vector<vector<int>> &gph, vector<int> &size) {
        int ans = 1;
        for(int g: gph[src])
            ans += helper(g, gph, size);
        return size[src] = ans;
    }
    ```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes. We perform a DFS traversal to calculate subtree sizes and then iterate through each node to compute scores.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for the adjacency list `g`, the `size` array, and the recursion stack in the DFS.

### Conclusion

This solution provides an efficient approach to finding nodes with the maximum score in a tree structure. By calculating subtree sizes and iteratively computing scores, the solution accurately determines the node counts with the highest score. The use of a helper function for subtree size calculation simplifies the logic and ensures the code is both time-efficient and space-efficient for large inputs. This approach is well-suited for scenarios involving complex tree computations, enabling scalable tree traversal and score calculation across various data sizes.
