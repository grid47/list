### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring case. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.

### Approach
1. Initialize two pointers:
   - `i`: starting from the beginning of the string.
   - `j`: starting from the end of the string.
2. Use a while loop to check characters while `i` is less than or equal to `j`:
   - Skip non-alphanumeric characters by incrementing `i` or decrementing `j` as needed.
   - Compare the characters at positions `i` and `j` after converting them to lowercase.
   - If they are equal, move both pointers inward.
   - If they are not equal, return `false` (the string is not a palindrome).
3. If the loop completes without mismatches, return `true` (the string is a palindrome).

### Code Walk-through
- **`isPalindrome` function**:
  - **Line 3**: Initialize two pointers `i` and `j`.
  - **Line 4**: Start a loop that continues while `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
    - **Line 5**: Check if the character at index `i` is alphanumeric; if not, increment `i`.
    - **Line 6**: Check if the character at index `j` is alphanumeric; if not, decrement `j`.
    - **Line 7**: Compare the characters at indices `i` and `j` after converting them to lowercase.
      - If they match, increment `i` and decrement `j`.
      - If they don't match, return `false`.
  - **Line 12**: Return `true` if all checks are passed (the string is a palindrome).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the length of the string, as we potentially traverse the entire string.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since no additional data structures are used that scale with input size.
