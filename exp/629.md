### Problem Statement
Given two integers `n` and `k`, you need to find the number of permutations of integers from `1` to `n` such that there are exactly `k` inverse pairs in the permutation. An inverse pair is defined as a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `nums[i] > nums[j]`.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Use a 2D array `dp[n + 1][k + 1]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of permutations of `i` integers with exactly `j` inverse pairs.
   - Initialize the array with `0`. The base case is `dp[0][0] = 1` since there is one way to have a permutation of zero integers with zero inverse pairs.

2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each `n` from `1` to `n`, and for each `k` from `0` to `k`, calculate the number of permutations using the formula:
     \[
     dp[n][k] = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} dp[n-1][k-i]
     \]
     This formula considers the number of ways to form permutations of `n` integers by adding each new integer (from `1` to `n`) to all possible positions of a permutation of `n-1` integers, thereby affecting the inverse pair count.

3. **Optimization**:
   - Since the number of permutations for `n` integers can grow large, apply modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The final answer is found in `dp[n][k]`, which gives the number of permutations of `n` integers with exactly `k` inverse pairs.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * k), as we iterate through each combination of `n` and `k`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * k), due to the storage of the DP table.
