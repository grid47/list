### Problem Statement
Given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with `n` nodes and a list of directed edges, the task is to find all the ancestors of each node in the graph. An ancestor of a node is any node that has a direct or indirect path to the node. The solution should return a list of sets where each set contains the ancestors of the node at the corresponding index.

### Approach
The solution leverages a **topological sorting** approach using **Kahn's Algorithm** to process nodes in a way that ensures ancestors are found for each node. By processing nodes with no incoming edges (i.e., independent nodes), and gradually removing their impact on other nodes' inward degrees, we can iteratively collect ancestors in a topological manner.

1. **Build the Graph**: We need to first construct a representation of the graph using adjacency lists (`grid`) and maintain an inward degree count (`inward`) to determine the dependencies between nodes.
2. **Topological Sorting with Kahn’s Algorithm**: Using Kahn’s Algorithm, nodes are processed in order of their inward degree (starting with nodes that have zero inward degree). This ensures that when processing a node, all its ancestors (if any) are processed first.
3. **Tracking Ancestors**: For each node processed, its ancestors are passed on to its neighbors, and they are accumulated in a `dag` set for each node.
4. **Return Result**: Finally, for each node, the ancestors are collected and returned.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)
1. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   ```cpp
   vector<set<int>> dag(n);
   vector<vector<int>> grid(n), sol(n);
   vector<int> inward(n, 0);
   ```
   - `dag[n]`: A vector of sets where each set will store the ancestors of each node.
   - `grid[n]`: An adjacency list representing the graph, where `grid[i]` stores all the nodes that are directly reachable from node `i`.
   - `sol[n]`: A vector to store the final result, where `sol[i]` contains the ancestors of node `i`.
   - `inward[n]`: A vector that tracks the number of incoming edges for each node, which helps in identifying nodes that have no incoming edges (i.e., source nodes).

2. **Build the Graph**:
   ```cpp
   for(auto it: edges) {
       grid[it[0]].push_back(it[1]);
       inward[it[1]]++;
   }
   ```
   - For each edge in the input `edges`, we update the adjacency list (`grid`) and increment the inward degree of the destination node (`inward[it[1]]`).

3. **Queue Initialization for Topological Sorting**:
   ```cpp
   queue<int> q;
   for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
       if(inward[i] == 0) q.push(i);
   ```
   - A queue `q` is initialized with all nodes that have zero incoming edges, meaning these nodes do not depend on any other node and can be processed first.

4. **Topological Sorting using Kahn’s Algorithm**:
   ```cpp
   while(!q.empty()) {
       int sz = q.size();
       while(sz--) {
           int tmp = q.front();
           q.pop();
           for(auto it: grid[tmp]) {
               inward[it]--;
               dag[it].insert(tmp);
               for(int x: dag[tmp])
                   dag[it].insert(x);
               if(inward[it] == 0)
                   q.push(it);
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   - This loop processes each node in the queue. For each node `tmp`:
     - We decrement the inward degree of each of its neighbors (`inward[it]--`).
     - We add `tmp` to the ancestor set of its neighbors (`dag[it].insert(tmp)`).
     - We propagate ancestors of `tmp` to its neighbors. If the neighbor `it` has already acquired ancestors through previous nodes, we copy them to `dag[it]`.
     - If any node’s inward degree becomes zero after processing `tmp`, it is added to the queue for future processing.

5. **Store the Ancestors**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       for(auto it: dag[i]) {
           sol[i].push_back(it);
       }
   }
   ```
   - After processing all nodes, we collect the ancestors from `dag[i]` into `sol[i]` for each node `i`.

6. **Return the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return sol;
   ```
   - Finally, the vector `sol` is returned, which contains the ancestors for each node.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Building the graph takes O(E), where `E` is the number of edges. Each node and edge is processed once.
  - Kahn’s algorithm processes each node and edge once, making it O(V + E), where `V` is the number of vertices (nodes) and `E` is the number of edges.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(V + E), which is optimal for processing a graph.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is O(V + E) due to the space required for the adjacency list (`grid`), the inward degree count (`inward`), and the ancestor sets (`dag`).
  - The `sol` array, which stores the final result, also contributes O(V + E) space as it holds a list of ancestors for each node.

### Conclusion
This solution efficiently finds the ancestors of each node in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using a combination of topological sorting and Kahn’s Algorithm. By processing nodes in the order of their inward degrees, we ensure that ancestors are correctly propagated and tracked. The time complexity of O(V + E) makes this approach suitable for large graphs, and the use of a queue and set data structures ensures that the solution is both space-efficient and easy to understand. This method is an excellent choice for problems involving ancestor relationships in directed graphs.
