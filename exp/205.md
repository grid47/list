### Problem Statement
Two strings `s` and `t` are called isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`. All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character.

### Approach
1. **Character Mapping**:
   - Use two hash maps (`fwd` and `rwd`) to store the character mappings from `s` to `t` and from `t` to `s`, respectively.

2. **Iterate Through Characters**:
   - Loop through each character of both strings:
     - For each character `s[i]`, check if it has already been mapped:
       - If it has, verify that the current character in `t` matches the previously mapped character.
       - If it does not match, return `false`.
     - Similarly, for `t[i]`, check the reverse mapping.
     - If both mappings are valid, add/update the mappings in `fwd` and `rwd`.

3. **Return Result**:
   - If the loop completes without mismatches, return `true`, indicating that the strings are isomorphic.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the class `Solution`.
- **Line 2**: Define the function `isIsomorphic(string s, string t)`.
- **Line 3**: Initialize two maps (`fwd` for forward mapping and `rwd` for reverse mapping).
- **Line 4**: Get the size of the strings.
- **Lines 5-15**: 
  - Iterate through the characters of the strings.
  - Check existing mappings and validate the current characters.
  - If any validation fails, return `false`.
  - Update the mappings after validation.
- **Line 16**: Return `true` if all mappings are valid.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the strings, as we traverse each character exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) in terms of the number of distinct characters (at most 256 for extended ASCII), which makes the space usage for the hash maps constant.
