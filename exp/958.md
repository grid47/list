### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree. A complete binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which all levels, except possibly the last, are completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

### Approach
1. **Level Order Traversal**:
   - The function uses a vector to simulate a queue for level order traversal of the binary tree, starting from the root node.

2. **Node Processing**:
   - Nodes are processed in the order they are added to the vector. For each node, its left and right children are added to the end of the vector.
   - The traversal continues until a null node is encountered, indicating the potential end of a complete level.

3. **Validation**:
   - After processing all nodes, the function checks if all subsequent nodes after the first null node are also null. If there are any non-null nodes after a null node, the tree is not complete.

### Code Walk-through
- The main function initializes a vector `q` and starts with the root node.
- It uses a loop to process each node, adding their children to `q`.
- After finishing processing, another loop checks for any remaining non-null nodes after the first null, determining if the tree is complete.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the nodes in the vector during traversal.
