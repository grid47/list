### Problem Statement

The problem involves creating a target array from two input arrays: `nums` and `index`. The goal is to build a new array called `target` such that each element from `nums` is inserted into `target` at the specified position indicated by `index`. Specifically, for each element in `nums`, it is placed in the `target` array at the corresponding position in `index`. If multiple elements are inserted at the same index, the existing elements are shifted to the right.

### Approach

To tackle this problem, the approach involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Create an array `ans` of the same size as `nums` initialized to zero, which will hold the resulting target array.

2. **Iterative Insertion**: Iterate through each element in `nums`:
   - Determine the index at which the current number should be inserted using the `index` array.
   - Shift existing elements in `ans` to the right to make space for the new element.
   - Insert the current number from `nums` at the determined index in `ans`.

3. **Return the Result**: After all elements are processed, return the `ans` array as the final target array.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here's a detailed breakdown of the provided C++ code:

1. **Class Definition**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
   ```
   - The `Solution` class encapsulates the functionality required to create the target array.

2. **Comparator Function (Unused)**:
   ```cpp
       static bool cmp(vector<int> &a, vector<int> &b) {
           return a[0] < b[0];
       }
   ```
   - A static comparator function is defined but not used in this context. It compares two vectors based on the first element. This could be useful if the function were to be modified for sorting, but it is not utilized in the current implementation.

3. **Main Function (createTargetArray)**:
   ```cpp
       vector<int> createTargetArray(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& index) {
           int n = nums.size();
           vector<int> ans(n, 0);
   ```
   - The `createTargetArray` function takes two vectors, `nums` and `index`, as input parameters.
   - It determines the size `n` of the `nums` array and initializes the `ans` array with zero values of the same size.

4. **Iterating Over Elements**:
   ```cpp
           for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
               int j = index[i];
   ```
   - A loop iterates through each element of `nums`, indexed by `i`.
   - For each iteration, it retrieves the corresponding index `j` from the `index` array.

5. **Shifting Elements**:
   ```cpp
               for(int k = n - 1; k > j; k--)
                   ans[k] = ans[k - 1];
   ```
   - A nested loop shifts existing elements in `ans` to the right starting from the end of the array, ensuring there is space to insert the new element at index `j`.
   - This loop runs from `n - 1` down to `j + 1`, moving elements one position to the right.

6. **Inserting the Current Element**:
   ```cpp
               ans[j] = nums[i];
           }
   ```
   - After shifting elements, the current number from `nums` is placed at the appropriate index `j` in the `ans` array.

7. **Returning the Result**:
   ```cpp
           return ans;
       }
   };
   ```
   - After all iterations are complete, the function returns the populated `ans` array, which represents the target array.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\). This is because for each of the \(n\) elements in `nums`, we may shift up to \(n\) elements to make space, resulting in a worst-case scenario of \(n \times n = n^2\).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the additional storage required for the `ans` array, which holds the target values.

### Conclusion

The provided solution effectively constructs a target array based on specified insertion indices while handling element shifting correctly. Although the algorithm is straightforward and correct, it suffers from inefficiency due to the \(O(n^2)\) time complexity arising from the nested loops.

While this approach works for reasonably sized inputs, it may not be optimal for larger datasets. Future optimizations could involve using a different data structure, such as a linked list or a more complex array manipulation technique, to minimize the need for shifting elements.

Overall, this solution serves as a good exercise in understanding how to manipulate arrays, handle indexing, and think about time complexity in algorithms. It also highlights the importance of considering both correctness and efficiency in algorithm design, making it a useful reference for similar array manipulation problems. By mastering these concepts, developers can tackle a variety of challenges related to data insertion, array manipulation, and algorithm optimization.
