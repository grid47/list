### Problem Statement
Given a list of points in the 2D plane, the task is to find the number of boomerangs. A boomerang is defined as a tuple of points `(P1, P2, P3)` such that the distance between `P1` and `P2` is the same as the distance between `P1` and `P3`, and `P2` and `P3` are distinct points.

### Approach
1. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Use the squared Euclidean distance to avoid floating-point precision issues and unnecessary square root calculations.
   - Define a helper function `getDist` to compute the squared distance between two points.

2. **Counting Distances**:
   - For each point `P1`, calculate the distance to every other point `P2`.
   - Store the counts of these distances in a map (`mp`), where the key is the distance and the value is the number of points at that distance.

3. **Calculating Boomerangs**:
   - For each unique distance, if there are `val` points at that distance from `P1`, the number of ways to choose two distinct points (for `P2` and `P3`) is `val * (val - 1)`.
   - This is because there are `val` options for `P2` and `val - 1` options for `P3`.

4. **Summing Results**:
   - Accumulate the counts of boomerangs for each point, clear the map after processing each point to avoid carrying over counts from previous iterations.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, return the total count of boomerangs found.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a variable `res` to store the result and a map `mp` to count distances for each point.

2. **Nested Loops for Distance Calculation**:
   - The outer loop iterates through each point as `P1`, while the inner loop calculates distances to every other point as `P2`.
   - Use the `getDist` function to compute the squared distance.

3. **Updating Boomerangs Count**:
   - For each distance in the map, calculate the number of boomerangs formed using the count of points at that distance.

4. **Clearing the Map**:
   - Clear the distance map after processing each point to ensure accurate counting for the next point.

5. **Returning the Count**:
   - Return the accumulated count of boomerangs after processing all points.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the number of points. The algorithm involves two nested loops to calculate distances.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of points, as we store distances in a map for each point.
