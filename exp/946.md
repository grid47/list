### Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays, `pushed` and `popped`, representing the push and pop sequences of a stack, determine if the `popped` sequence could be the result of popping elements from the stack after pushing all elements from the `pushed` sequence.

### Approach
1. **Initialize a Stack**:
   - Use a stack to simulate the push and pop operations.

2. **Push and Pop Simulation**:
   - Push the first element of the `pushed` array onto the stack.
   - Use two pointers: `i` for iterating through `pushed` and `j` for `popped`.
   - While iterating, check if the top of the stack matches the current element of the `popped` array:
     - If they match, pop from the stack and move the `j` pointer forward.
     - Continue this process until the top of the stack no longer matches the current element in `popped`.

3. **Continue Pushing**:
   - Push the next element from the `pushed` array onto the stack.
   - Repeat the process until all elements from `pushed` are pushed onto the stack.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After pushing all elements, perform a final check to see if there are any remaining matches between the stack and the `popped` sequence.

5. **Return Result**:
   - If the stack is empty after processing, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Code Walk-through
- The function initializes the stack and processes the `pushed` array while simultaneously checking against the `popped` array to ensure the order of popping is valid.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `pushed` and `popped`, as each element is processed at most twice (once pushed and once popped).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the use of the stack for storing elements.
