### üîç **Problem: Single Number**

You are given an integer array `nums[]`, where every element appears **exactly twice** except for one element, which appears **once**. The task is to determine the element that appears only once, using the most efficient solution possible.

### üß† **Approach:**

To solve this problem efficiently, we can leverage the **XOR** (exclusive OR) operation. The XOR operation has the following useful properties:

1. **a ^ a = 0**: XOR-ing a number with itself results in zero.
2. **a ^ 0 = a**: XOR-ing a number with zero results in the number itself.
3. XOR is **commutative** and **associative**, which means the order of applying XOR does not matter.

By using these properties, we can XOR all the elements of the array. Here‚Äôs how this works:
- **Duplicate elements**: When two identical numbers are XOR-ed, they cancel each other out (because **a ^ a = 0**).
- **The unique element**: The single number that doesn‚Äôt have a pair will be left out after all XOR operations, as it won‚Äôt cancel out with any other number.

### üîß **Code Walkthrough:**

#### Step 1: **Initialize the variable**
We start by initializing a variable `x` to `0`, which will hold the result after performing XOR on all elements.

```cpp
int x = 0;
```

Starting with `0` is important because XOR-ing any number with `0` leaves the number unchanged.

#### Step 2: **Iterate through the array**
We then loop through each element in the array and XOR it with `x`.

```cpp
for(int y: nums)
    x ^= y;
```

- If `y` is a number that appears twice, XOR-ing it with `x` will cancel it out (i.e., set it to `0`).
- If `y` is the single number that appears only once, it will accumulate in `x` because it doesn‚Äôt have a duplicate to cancel it out.

#### Step 3: **Return the result**
After completing the loop, the variable `x` will hold the value of the number that appears only once.

```cpp
return x;
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Complexity Analysis:**

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We iterate over the array once, and each XOR operation is constant time (O(1)). Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: We only use a constant amount of extra space. The only variable used is `x`, so the space complexity is **O(1)**.

---

### üöÄ **Conclusion:**

This solution is optimal both in terms of time and space:

- **Time Efficiency**: It runs in **O(n)** time, making it suitable for large arrays.
- **Space Efficiency**: It uses **O(1)** space, meaning no extra storage is required except for the result.

By exploiting the XOR properties, this solution efficiently cancels out pairs of identical elements and leaves the single unique element.

### üßë‚Äçüè´ **Example Walkthrough:**

Let‚Äôs take an example to see how this works:

```cpp
nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
```

1. Initialize `x = 0`.
2. XOR-ing through the array:
   - `x = 0 ^ 4 = 4`
   - `x = 4 ^ 1 = 5`
   - `x = 5 ^ 2 = 7`
   - `x = 7 ^ 1 = 6`
   - `x = 6 ^ 2 = 4`
3. At the end of the iteration, `x = 4`, which is the number that appears only once.

This approach is simple, efficient, and elegant!
