### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears twice except for one, find the single element that appears only once.

### Approach
1. **XOR Operation**:
   - Utilize the property of the XOR operation: 
     - \( a \oplus a = 0 \) (any number XORed with itself results in zero)
     - \( a \oplus 0 = a \) (any number XORed with zero results in the number itself)
   - When we XOR all the numbers in the array, the duplicates will cancel each other out, leaving only the unique number.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 5**: Initialize an integer variable `x` to 0.
- **Line 6**: Iterate through each number `y` in the `nums` array.
- **Line 7**: XOR `y` with `x`. This accumulates the result such that all duplicate numbers cancel out.
- **Line 8**: Return the result in `x`, which will be the single number.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in the `nums` array, as we need to iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
