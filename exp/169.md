### Problem Statement

The task is to find the majority element in a given integer array `nums`. A majority element is defined as an element that appears more than **n/2** times in the array, where `n` is the size of the array. If there is no such element, the function should return a value (though the problem guarantees that a majority element will always exist).

For example:
- In the array `[3, 2, 3]`, the majority element is `3`.
- In the array `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`, the majority element is `2`.

### Approach

To solve the problem efficiently, we need to identify the element that appears more than half the times in the array. A brute force approach would involve counting the occurrences of each element, but this could take O(nÂ²) time in the worst case (when checking for each element). Instead, a more efficient approach uses a hash map (or frequency map) to track the count of each element and keep track of the maximum count as we iterate through the array. This approach operates in linear time **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the array.

#### Steps:
1. We will iterate through the array and maintain a frequency map (`map<int, int> mp`) that tracks the count of each element.
2. As we process each element, we update the count for that element in the map.
3. While updating, we also track the element that has the highest frequency (`cnt`) and update the majority element (`e`) accordingly.
4. After processing the entire array, the element `e` will be the majority element.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's go through the code step by step.

```cpp
int e = nums[0], cnt = 1;
map<int, int> mp;
```
- Here, we initialize `e` as the first element of the array and `cnt` as `1` because we have already seen the first element. `mp` is a frequency map that will store the count of each element in the array.

```cpp
for(int x: nums) {
    mp[x]++;
```
- We iterate through each element `x` in the array `nums`.
- For each element, we increment its count in the map (`mp[x]++`).

```cpp
    if(mp[x] > cnt) {
        cnt = mp[x];
        e = x;
    }
}
```
- Inside the loop, we check if the current count of the element (`mp[x]`) exceeds the previously tracked count `cnt`.
- If the count of the current element is greater than `cnt`, we update `cnt` to the new count and update `e` to the current element (`x`).
- This ensures that `e` always holds the element with the highest frequency.

```cpp
return e;
```
- After processing all elements in the array, we return `e`, which will hold the majority element, as it has the highest count in the frequency map.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the array `nums`. This is because we are iterating over the array once, and the map operations (`mp[x]++`) are O(1) on average. The total time complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the array.

#### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is **O(n)** in the worst case, because we are storing the frequency of each element in the map `mp`. In the worst case, all elements in the array could be unique, leading to a map of size `n`. If there are repeated elements, the space usage could be lower, but the worst-case complexity remains O(n).

### Conclusion

This approach effectively solves the problem of finding the majority element in linear time, using a frequency map to track the counts of each element. The solution ensures that we efficiently identify the element with the highest frequency without resorting to a brute-force search.

#### Key Points:
- **Efficient Time Complexity**: The solution runs in linear time **O(n)**, making it suitable for large input arrays.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the usage of a map to store frequencies of elements.
- **Majority Element**: This solution guarantees that the majority element will be found, as specified in the problem statement.

This code is both time-efficient and simple to understand, making it an excellent approach to solving the majority element problem in an optimal manner.
