### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of size `n`, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than `n/2` times. It is guaranteed that a majority element always exists in the array.

### Approach
1. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - Utilize a hash map (or dictionary) to count the occurrences of each element in the array.

2. **Finding the Majority Element**:
   - Iterate through the array, updating the count for each element.
   - Keep track of the element with the maximum count, which will be the majority element.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the function `majorityElement`.
- **Line 2**: Initialize `e` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to 1 (since we have at least one occurrence of the first element).
- **Line 3**: Create a hash map `mp` to count occurrences of elements.
- **Lines 4-8**: Loop through each element `x` in `nums`:
  - Increment the count of `x` in the hash map.
  - If the count of `x` exceeds the current maximum count (`cnt`), update `cnt` and set `e` to `x`.
- **Line 9**: Return the majority element `e`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`, as we traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) in the worst case due to the hash map storage for the counts.
