### Problem Statement
Given an array of stock prices `prices`, where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day, find the maximum profit you can achieve by performing at most two transactions (i.e., buy and sell up to two times).

### Approach
1. Initialize four variables:
   - `s1`: The maximum profit achievable by making the first purchase.
   - `s2`: The maximum profit achievable by making the first sale.
   - `s3`: The maximum profit achievable by making the second purchase.
   - `s4`: The maximum profit achievable by making the second sale.
2. Iterate through each price in the `prices` vector:
   - Update `s1` to be the maximum of `s1` and the negative of the current price (representing the cost of buying the stock).
   - Update `s2` to be the maximum of `s2` and the profit from selling after the first buy (`s1 + prices[i]`).
   - Update `s3` to be the maximum of `s3` and the profit after making the second purchase (`s2 - prices[i]`).
   - Update `s4` to be the maximum of `s4` and the profit from selling after the second buy (`s3 + prices[i]`).
3. Return the maximum profit achievable from selling after the second transaction or 0 if no profit is possible.

### Code Walk-through
- **`maxProfit` function**:
  - **Line 2**: Check if the `prices` vector is empty. If so, return 0 (no profit possible).
  - **Line 3**: Initialize `s1`, `s2`, `s3`, and `s4` to their starting values.
  - **Line 5**: Get the size of the `prices` vector.
  - **Line 7**: Loop through the prices starting from the second day.
    - **Line 8**: Update `s1` to be the maximum of the previous `s1` and the negative of the current price (representing the cost of buying).
    - **Line 9**: Update `s2` based on the profit from selling after the first purchase.
    - **Line 10**: Update `s3` based on the profit after making the second purchase.
    - **Line 11**: Update `s4` based on the profit from selling after the second purchase.
  
- **Line 13**: Return the maximum profit from `s4` or 0.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of days (length of the `prices` array), since we make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we only use a constant amount of space for the four variables `s1`, `s2`, `s3`, and `s4`.
