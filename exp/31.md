### Problem Statement
Implement the function to find the next lexicographical permutation of a given sequence of numbers. The algorithm should rearrange the numbers into the next greater permutation of numbers.

### Approach
1. **Identify the Pivot**:
   - Traverse the array from right to left to find the first pair of consecutive elements `(nums[i], nums[i+1])` where `nums[i] < nums[i+1]`. This index `i` is the pivot where the next greater permutation can be formed.

2. **Check for Last Permutation**:
   - If no such pivot is found (i.e., `idx` remains `-1`), the current permutation is the largest, and we should reverse the entire array to get the smallest permutation.

3. **Find the Successor**:
   - Once the pivot is identified, look for the smallest element to the right of `idx` that is larger than `nums[idx]`. Swap these two elements.

4. **Reverse the Suffix**:
   - Reverse the sub-array that comes after the pivot index to ensure it is in the lowest possible order.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Finding the Pivot**: The first loop iterates backward to locate the pivot index `idx`.
2. **Reversing for Last Permutation**: If `idx` is `-1`, reverse the entire array and return.
3. **Swapping Elements**: The second loop finds the element to swap with the pivot and performs the swap.
4. **Reversing the Suffix**: Finally, reverse the elements after the pivot to ensure the smallest arrangement.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array, since each of the main steps (finding the pivot, swapping, and reversing) requires linear time.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as the rearrangement is done in place without requiring additional storage.
