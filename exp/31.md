### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to generate the **next lexicographically greater permutation** of a given list of numbers. A permutation of a set of numbers is an arrangement of the elements of the set in a particular order. The task is to transform the given list of numbers into its next permutation in a way that it is greater than the current permutation, but as small as possible in lexicographical order.

If no such permutation exists (i.e., the input is already the largest permutation possible), the algorithm should rearrange the list into the **smallest permutation** (sorted in ascending order).

### Approach

To generate the next permutation, the algorithm follows a specific sequence of steps. The approach is inspired by the idea that the permutation can be viewed as a number, and finding the next permutation involves applying the following concepts:

1. **Find the Rightmost Ascending Pair:**
   - The first step is to identify the rightmost pair of elements where the element at index `i` is smaller than the element at index `i+1`. This indicates the point at which the sequence is no longer in descending order.
   
2. **Find the Next Larger Element:**
   - After identifying the point where the order breaks (the rightmost ascent), the next step is to find the smallest element greater than the one at index `i`. This ensures that the next permutation is as small as possible while still being greater than the current one.

3. **Swap Elements:**
   - After finding the right elements, the algorithm swaps the two elements â€” the element at index `i` and the element that is the smallest greater number to its right.

4. **Reverse the Suffix:**
   - After the swap, the portion of the list from index `i+1` onward will be in descending order. To get the smallest lexicographical order, reverse this part of the list to make it ascending.

5. **Edge Case (Largest Permutation):**
   - If no such ascending pair exists (i.e., the list is in descending order), the algorithm simply reverses the entire list to achieve the smallest possible permutation.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
int idx = -1;
for(int i = nums.size() - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    if(nums[i] < nums[i+1]) { 
        idx = i;
        break;
    }
}
```
- This loop scans the list from right to left to find the first number (`nums[i]`) that is smaller than the number immediately to its right (`nums[i+1]`). This is the first indication that the current permutation can still be increased.
- If no such element is found, it implies the list is in descending order, and no larger permutation is possible.

```cpp
if(idx == -1) {
    reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    return;
}
```
- If no ascending pair was found (`idx == -1`), this means that the current permutation is the largest possible permutation. Therefore, the list is reversed to produce the smallest possible permutation (which is in ascending order).

```cpp
for(int i = nums.size() - 1; i > idx; i--) {
    if(nums[i] > nums[idx]) {
        swap(nums[idx], nums[i]);
        break;
    }
}
```
- This loop finds the smallest number greater than `nums[idx]` from the right side of the list (i.e., to the right of the found index `idx`). Once such a number is found, it is swapped with `nums[idx]` to ensure the next permutation is as close to the current one as possible but greater.

```cpp
reverse(nums.begin() + idx + 1, nums.end());
```
- Finally, the portion of the list after the `idx` (i.e., from `idx + 1` to the end) is reversed. This is because, after swapping, the sublist is in descending order, and reversing it results in the smallest lexicographical order for that part of the list.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The algorithm involves:
  1. A linear scan from right to left to find the first ascending pair (O(n)).
  2. Another linear scan from the right side to find the element to swap with `nums[idx]` (O(n)).
  3. A reverse operation (O(n)) on the portion of the list after the swap.
  
  Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the input list.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space (excluding the input list itself), which is required for the index `idx` and the loop variables.

### Conclusion

The **nextPermutation** algorithm efficiently finds the next lexicographically greater permutation of a list of numbers by using an in-place approach with constant space complexity. This algorithm works by first finding the rightmost pair of elements where the order breaks, swapping elements to maintain the smallest lexicographical increment, and then reversing the remaining portion of the list to ensure it is as small as possible.

This solution is optimal with a time complexity of **O(n)** and a space complexity of **O(1)**, making it ideal for large inputs where performance is crucial. Whether the input is already in the largest permutation (in which case it gets rearranged into the smallest permutation), or is somewhere in between, this approach guarantees the next permutation efficiently.

This approach is widely applicable in problems involving permutations, combinations, and ordering constraints, and can be extended to other variations of permutation-related tasks, including generating permutations in lexicographical order.
