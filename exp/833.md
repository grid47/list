### Problem Statement
The task is to replace substrings in a given string `s` based on specified indices, sources, and targets. Each substring specified by `sources` at the corresponding `indices` should be replaced by the corresponding string in `targets` if the substring matches.

### Approach
1. **Preparation**:
   - Create a vector of pairs, `ind`, where each pair consists of an index and its corresponding position in the `indices` vector. This helps to keep track of the original index when sorting.
   
2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the `ind` vector in descending order based on the indices. This ensures that when we modify the string `s`, we start from the end, preventing any shifts in indices that would occur if we modified earlier parts of the string.

3. **Replacement**:
   - Iterate through the sorted indices and check if the substring in `s` matches the corresponding `src` from `sources`. If it does, replace that substring with the corresponding `tgt` from `targets`.

### Code Walk-through
- The function first constructs the `ind` vector from the `indices`.
- After sorting `ind` in reverse order, the function checks each index to see if the corresponding substring in `s` matches the `src`. If it matches, it performs the replacement.
- Finally, the modified string `s` is returned.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(M + K log K), where M is the length of the string `s` and K is the number of indices, sources, and targets. The log K arises from the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(K) for the additional storage of the `ind` vector.
