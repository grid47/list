### Problem Statement
Design and implement a circular queue that supports the following operations:
- `enQueue(value)`: Adds an item to the rear of the queue. Returns `true` if the operation is successful.
- `deQueue()`: Removes an item from the front of the queue. Returns `true` if the operation is successful.
- `Front()`: Gets the front item from the queue. Returns `-1` if the queue is empty.
- `Rear()`: Gets the last item from the queue. Returns `-1` if the queue is empty.
- `isEmpty()`: Checks whether the queue is empty.
- `isFull()`: Checks whether the queue is full.

### Approach
1. **Data Structure**: Use a vector to store the elements of the circular queue. Maintain two pointers, `frd` and `bck`, to indicate the front and back of the queue, respectively. Use a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of elements in the queue.
  
2. **Circular Indexing**: When adding or removing elements, use modulo operations to wrap around the indices, allowing for circular behavior.

3. **Queue Operations**:
   - **`enQueue(value)`**:
     - Check if the queue is full. If it is, return false.
     - Increment the `bck` pointer and insert the value.
     - Increment the counter.
   - **`deQueue()`**:
     - Check if the queue is empty. If it is, return false.
     - Increment the `frd` pointer and decrement the counter.
   - **`Front()`** and **`Rear()`**:
     - Check if the queue is empty. If it is, return -1. Otherwise, return the corresponding value.
   - **`isEmpty()`**: Returns true if the counter is zero.
   - **`isFull()`**: Returns true if the counter is equal to the size of the queue.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for all operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the size of the queue.
