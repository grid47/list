### Problem Statement
Given two integers, `startValue` and `target`, find the minimum number of operations needed to reach `target` from `startValue` using the following operations:
1. Multiply `startValue` by 2.
2. Subtract 1 from `startValue`.

### Approach
- Instead of incrementally transforming `startValue` to `target`, we reverse the approach by starting from `target` and reducing it to `startValue`.
- The logic:
  - If `startValue` is greater than or equal to `target`, the only option is to subtract until `startValue` equals `target`.
  - If `target` is even, dividing it by 2 reduces the distance to `startValue` with fewer operations.
  - If `target` is odd, incrementing it by 1 makes it even, allowing division in the next recursive step.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Base Case**:
   - If `startValue` is greater than or equal to `target`, return the difference `startValue - target`.
2. **Recursive Steps**:
   - If `target` is even, recursively calculate the operations for `target / 2` and add 1 for the division operation.
   - If `target` is odd, increment `target` by 1, making it even, then recurse with the incremented value.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log(target)), as each step either halves `target` or adds one to make it even.
- **Space Complexity**: O(log(target)), due to recursive stack usage.
