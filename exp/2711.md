### Problem Statement

Given a 2D grid of integers, the task is to calculate the difference of distinct values between the upper-left diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and lower-right diagonal (from bottom-left to top-right) for each cell. Specifically, for each cell in the grid, you need to compute the absolute difference between the number of distinct values in its upper-left diagonal and the number of distinct values in its lower-right diagonal. The result should be returned as a 2D grid of the same dimensions, where each cell contains this computed difference.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:

1. **Understand the grid structure**:
   - Each element in the grid has two diagonals:
     - **Upper-left diagonal**: This diagonal moves from the current cell towards the top-left direction. We need to traverse this diagonal and track the distinct values.
     - **Lower-right diagonal**: This diagonal moves from the current cell towards the bottom-right direction. Similarly, we need to traverse this diagonal and track the distinct values.
   
2. **Iterate over the grid**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid, compute the distinct values in the upper-left and lower-right diagonals.
   - Use sets to store the distinct values encountered along the diagonals since sets automatically handle duplicate values.

3. **Compute the difference**:
   - For each cell, compute the difference between the number of distinct values in the upper-left diagonal and the lower-right diagonal.
   - Store the absolute difference in the result grid.

4. **Return the result**:
   - After processing all the cells in the grid, return the resulting grid.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize variables
```cpp
int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
vector<vector<int>> ans(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
set<int> ls, rs;
```
- `m` and `n` represent the dimensions of the grid (rows and columns, respectively).
- `ans` is a 2D vector initialized to store the result of the computations for each cell in the grid.
- `ls` and `rs` are sets used to store the distinct values along the upper-left and lower-right diagonals, respectively.

#### Step 2: Traverse the grid and compute diagonals for each cell
```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        int r = i - 1, c = j - 1;
        
        while(r >= 0 && c >= 0) {
            ls.insert(grid[r][c]);
            r--;
            c--;
        }
        
        r = i + 1, c = j + 1;
        
        while(r < m && c < n) {
            rs.insert(grid[r][c]);
            r++;
            c++;
        }
```
- We loop through each cell in the grid using two nested loops: one for the rows (`i`) and one for the columns (`j`).
- For each cell, we initialize the row (`r`) and column (`c`) pointers for the upper-left diagonal to be one cell above and one cell to the left of the current cell (`i - 1`, `j - 1`).
- We then traverse the upper-left diagonal by moving up and left, inserting the elements into the `ls` set until we hit the top or left boundary of the grid.
- After processing the upper-left diagonal, we reset the row (`r`) and column (`c`) pointers for the lower-right diagonal to be one cell below and one cell to the right of the current cell (`i + 1`, `j + 1`).
- We traverse the lower-right diagonal by moving down and right, inserting the elements into the `rs` set until we hit the bottom or right boundary of the grid.

#### Step 3: Compute the difference of distinct values and store it
```cpp
int res = ls.size() - rs.size();
ans[i][j] = abs(res);
ls.clear();
rs.clear();
```
- After traversing both diagonals for the current cell, we calculate the difference between the sizes of the `ls` and `rs` sets, which represent the number of distinct values in the upper-left and lower-right diagonals, respectively.
- We store the absolute value of the difference in the `ans` matrix at the corresponding position `ans[i][j]`.
- We clear the sets `ls` and `rs` to prepare them for the next cell's diagonal computations.

#### Step 4: Return the result
```cpp
return ans;
```
- After all cells have been processed, we return the `ans` matrix, which contains the computed differences of distinct values for each cell in the grid.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. This is because:
  - For each cell, we traverse both its upper-left and lower-right diagonals, which takes **O(m + n)** time in the worst case. However, since the size of each diagonal is bounded by the grid dimensions, the time complexity is proportional to the total number of cells in the grid, i.e., **O(m * n)**.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. This is because the `ans` matrix has a size of **O(m * n)**, and the sets `ls` and `rs` are used temporarily for each cell to store distinct values along the diagonals, which can hold at most `min(m, n)` elements. Thus, the space complexity is dominated by the size of the `ans` matrix.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the difference of distinct values between the upper-left and lower-right diagonals for each cell in the grid. By using sets to track distinct values and iterating through the grid with two nested loops, we ensure an optimal approach that operates in **O(m * n)** time. The space complexity is also **O(m * n)**, which is efficient given the problem constraints. This approach provides a clean and scalable solution to the problem.
