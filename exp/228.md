### 🚀 Problem Statement

The problem asks us to return the summary of a given list of sorted integers as ranges. A range is a sequence of consecutive integers. The goal is to group consecutive integers together and represent them as a range, such as `"1->5"` instead of listing all the integers individually (`"1", "2", "3", "4", "5"`). If the integers are not consecutive, they should be listed individually.

### 🧠 Approach

To solve this problem, we will iterate through the sorted list of integers and group consecutive numbers together as ranges. For any number that is not part of a range, we will list it as an individual number.

Here's the strategy:

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the input list is empty, we return an empty result immediately.
   
2. **Iterate Through the List:**
   - We initialize a pointer `i` to iterate through the list, identifying consecutive sequences and representing them as ranges.
   
3. **Range Construction:**
   - When we detect consecutive integers, we will create a range in the format `"start->end"`. For isolated numbers, we’ll simply list the number.
   
4. **Update Pointer:**
   - After processing a range or a number, we update the pointer to continue from the next element.

5. **Return Result:**
   - Finally, we return the summarized list of ranges or individual numbers.

### 🔨 Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

#### Step 1: Handle Edge Case for Empty Input

```cpp
const int size_n = nums.size();
vector<string> res;
if (0 == size_n) return res;
```

- First, we check if the input list `nums` is empty. If so, we return an empty result (`res`). This is important to avoid unnecessary processing for an empty list.

#### Step 2: Initialize the Iteration Variables

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < size_n;) {
    int start = i, end = i;
```

- We begin iterating through the list, where `i` keeps track of the current position. The `start` and `end` variables mark the beginning and end of a potential range.

#### Step 3: Find Consecutive Numbers in the List

```cpp
while (end + 1 < size_n && nums[end + 1] == nums[end] + 1) end++;
```

- Inside the `while` loop, we check if the current number is consecutive to the next. If so, we move the `end` pointer forward to extend the range. The condition ensures that we don’t go out of bounds and that the numbers are consecutive.

#### Step 4: Construct the Range

```cpp
if (end > start) res.push_back(to_string(nums[start]) + "->" + to_string(nums[end]));
else res.push_back(to_string(nums[start]));
```

- After identifying the range, we check if it contains more than one number. If so, we create a range in the format `"start->end"`. If the range consists of just one number, we add the number itself.

#### Step 5: Move to the Next Range or Number

```cpp
i = end + 1;
```

- Once a range or number is processed, we update `i` to `end + 1`, which moves the pointer past the current range to continue processing the next sequence.

#### Step 6: Return the Result

```cpp
return res;
```

- Finally, after processing all elements, we return the `res` vector containing the summarized ranges or individual numbers.

### 📈 Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the input list. 

- The main loop iterates through each element exactly once, and the inner `while` loop only iterates for consecutive numbers. Therefore, every element is visited once, resulting in a linear time complexity.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is **O(n)**, as the result list `res` can contain up to `n` elements, where `n` is the number of integers in the input list.

### 🏁 Conclusion

In this solution, we efficiently summarize ranges of consecutive integers in a sorted list. By iterating through the list and checking for consecutive numbers, we can group them into ranges or list individual numbers as needed.

This algorithm is optimal with a time complexity of **O(n)** and a space complexity of **O(n)**, making it well-suited for large lists of integers. The edge case handling for empty inputs also ensures the solution is robust and ready for all scenarios.

### ✨ Quick Recap

- The algorithm iterates through the list to identify and group consecutive numbers into ranges.
- Each range is represented as `"start->end"`, and isolated numbers are listed individually.
- The solution has a linear time complexity, making it both efficient and scalable!
