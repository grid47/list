### Problem Statement
Given a sorted integer array without duplicates, return the summary of its ranges. For example, for the input `[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7]`, the output should be `["0->2", "4->5", "7"]`.

### Approach
- **Iterate through the array**: Use a while loop to traverse the array and identify continuous ranges.
- **Track the start and end of ranges**: For each range, keep track of the starting index and extend the end index as long as the next number is consecutive.
- **Generate output**: If the start and end indices are the same, append the single number; otherwise, append the range in the format `"start->end"`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function `summaryRanges(vector<int>& nums)`**:
  - Initialize the result vector `res` and check if the input `nums` is empty.
  - Use a loop to iterate through the input array:
    - Set `start` and `end` to the current index `i`.
    - Use a nested while loop to extend `end` while the next number is consecutive.
    - Based on whether `start` equals `end`, either push a single number or a range string to `res`.
    - Update `i` to `end + 1` for the next iteration.
  - Return the `res` vector containing the ranges.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`, since each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of ranges generated, which could be at most \(n\) in the case of no ranges.
