### Problem Statement
The objective of this problem is to remove adjacent duplicate characters from a string `s`. Specifically, if there are `k` or more consecutive identical characters in the string, all of those characters should be removed. This process may need to be repeated as new duplicates may emerge after previous removals. The challenge lies in efficiently managing the removal of these duplicates while traversing the string.

### Approach
To solve this problem, we can utilize a stack-based approach where we maintain a vector of pairs. Each pair consists of:
1. The count of consecutive characters.
2. The character itself.

This stack-like structure allows us to efficiently track the counts of characters and remove them when they reach the specified threshold `k`. The process can be broken down into the following steps:
1. Traverse the string and maintain a count of consecutive characters.
2. When the count of a character reaches `k`, remove it from the stack.
3. Construct the final result string from the remaining characters in the stack.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeDuplicates(string s, int k) {
        vector<pair<int, char>> stk = {{0, '#'}};
```
- **Lines 1-3**: Define the `Solution` class and the `removeDuplicates` method, which takes a string `s` and an integer `k` as parameters. A vector of pairs, `stk`, is initialized with a dummy character `'#'` to handle edge cases where the first character needs to be added.

```cpp
        for(char c : s) {
```
- **Line 4**: Begin a loop to iterate through each character `c` in the input string `s`.

```cpp
            if(stk.back().second != c)
                stk.push_back({1, c});
```
- **Lines 5-7**: Check if the current character `c` is different from the character at the top of the stack (`stk.back().second`). If it is, push a new pair onto the stack with a count of `1` and the current character.

```cpp
            else if(++stk.back().first == k)
                stk.pop_back();
```
- **Lines 8-10**: If the current character is the same as the top character in the stack, increment the count of that character (`stk.back().first`). If this count equals `k`, it means we have found `k` consecutive characters, and we need to remove them. Therefore, we pop the top element from the stack.

```cpp
        string res;
        for(auto x: stk)
            res.append(x.first, x.second);
```
- **Lines 11-13**: Initialize an empty string `res`. Then, iterate through each pair in the stack and append the character `x.second` to `res`, repeated `x.first` times, effectively reconstructing the modified string without the removed duplicates.

```cpp
        return res;
    }
};
```
- **Lines 14-16**: Finally, return the result string `res`, which contains the characters of `s` with all adjacent duplicates removed according to the specified rules.

### Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string `s`. Each character is processed once, and operations on the stack (push and pop) are \(O(1)\).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is \(O(n)\) in the worst case, where no characters are removed and all characters end up in the stack. The additional space used for the output string `res` also contributes to this complexity.

### Conclusion
The `removeDuplicates` function provides an efficient solution to the problem of removing adjacent duplicates from a string based on a specified count `k`. By using a stack-like structure, the algorithm effectively tracks the counts of characters and facilitates the removal process. The linear time complexity ensures that this solution is suitable for larger strings, making it both efficient and elegant. This method exemplifies the power of using data structures like stacks to manage and solve problems related to sequences and grouping in strings. Overall, this function is a practical approach to address string manipulation tasks in competitive programming and software development.
