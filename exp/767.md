### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, rearrange its characters so that no two adjacent characters are the same. If this is not possible, return an empty string.

### Approach
1. **Frequency Count**:
   - Use an array `frq` to count the frequency of each character.
   - Identify the character with the maximum frequency (`mfq`).

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - If the most frequent character occurs more than half the length of the string (rounded up), return an empty string as rearrangement is impossible.

3. **Placement**:
   - First, place the most frequent character in the even indices of the result string.
   - Then, fill the remaining characters in the odd indices until all characters are placed.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method for rearranging the string.

- **Method**:
  - `string reorganizeString(string s)`: Implements the logic to reorganize the string.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, as each character is processed a limited number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the frequency array has a constant size (26 for lowercase letters).
