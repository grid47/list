### Problem Statement

The problem involves determining the minimum total time required to finish `numLaps` in a racing game, where the player can use a set of tires that each have a time-to-completion and a time-exponent multiplier. Each tire has the property that after each lap, its time to complete the next lap is multiplied by a constant factor. The challenge is to determine the optimal tire usage and strategy to minimize the total time taken to complete the required number of laps.

Given:
- `tires[i][0]`: the initial time to complete the first lap using the `i-th` tire.
- `tires[i][1]`: the multiplier for subsequent laps using the same tire.
- `cT`: a constant time that represents the time taken to switch tires (we assume the switch happens only once).
- `numLaps`: the total number of laps the player needs to complete.

The goal is to compute the minimum time required to finish all `numLaps`.

### Approach

This problem can be tackled using dynamic programming (DP) combined with depth-first search (DFS) to efficiently compute the minimal total time. The key idea is to minimize the time for each lap by using the best tire strategy.

Here’s the breakdown of the approach:
1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: 
   - We want to calculate the minimal time to complete `lap` laps. For each lap, the goal is to consider all possible tire choices and their associated costs, which depend on both the number of laps completed and the tire’s characteristics (initial time and multiplier).
   
2. **Tires' Time Calculation**: 
   - For each tire, we compute how its time evolves for successive laps. We store the best (minimal) time required to complete each number of laps with each tire. This step avoids recalculating the times for different lap numbers multiple times.
   
3. **DFS with Memoization**:
   - We use DFS to explore all possible strategies for completing the `numLaps`. Starting with `numLaps` laps, we recursively try different tire strategies and memoize the results to avoid redundant computations.

4. **Base Case and Recursive Exploration**: 
   - If `lap == 0`, no more laps need to be completed, so the time returned is the current cost `-cT` (to account for the switching cost).
   - If a result for a certain number of laps has already been computed (stored in `dp[lap]`), we return that result to avoid recalculating it.
   - For each tire, we calculate the cost for a certain number of laps, explore the result recursively, and update the answer with the minimum time.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. Class Variables and Initialization
```cpp
int mx_lap = 0;
int dp[1001] = {}, best[1001] = {};
```
- `mx_lap`: Tracks the maximum number of laps encountered for which a valid tire configuration exists.
- `dp[1001]`: Memoization table to store the minimal time required to complete a certain number of laps.
- `best[1001]`: Stores the minimal time required to complete `lap` laps using the best tire configuration for that lap count.

#### 2. DFS Helper Function
```cpp
int dfs(int lap, int cT) {
    if(lap == 0) return -cT;
    if(dp[lap]) return dp[lap];
    
    int ans = INT_MAX;
    for(int i = 1; i <= min(mx_lap, lap); i++) {
        ans = min(ans, best[i] + cT + dfs(lap - i, cT));
    }
    return dp[lap] = ans;
}
```
- **Base case**: If no laps remain (`lap == 0`), the function returns `-cT` to account for the cost of switching tires.
- **Memoization**: If the minimal time for `lap` laps has been calculated before (`dp[lap] != 0`), the function simply returns that value.
- **Recursive Exploration**: The function iterates over all possible lap combinations, where `i` represents the number of laps completed with one tire. For each choice, it calculates the total time using `best[i]` and recursively computes the time for the remaining laps (`lap - i`).

#### 3. Main Function to Compute Minimum Finish Time
```cpp
int minimumFinishTime(vector<vector<int>>& tires, int cT, int numLaps) {
    for(auto it: tires) {
        long long time = it[0], exp = it[0];
        for(int lap = 1; lap <= numLaps && exp < it[0] + cT; lap++) {
            
            mx_lap = max(mx_lap, lap);
            
            if(best[lap] == 0 || best[lap] > time)
                best[lap] = time;
            
            exp *= it[1];
            time += exp;
        }
    }
    return dfs(numLaps, cT);
}
```
- **Iterating through tires**: The `for` loop iterates over each tire configuration (given by `tires[i]`). For each tire, the loop computes the time required to complete successive laps using that tire.
    - The variable `exp` keeps track of the total time for each lap using the current tire configuration. Initially, `exp` is set to the initial time for the first lap (`it[0]`), and for subsequent laps, it is multiplied by the tire’s multiplier (`it[1]`).
    - The inner loop calculates the time for each lap and updates `best[lap]` with the minimum time for completing `lap` laps using this tire.
    - `mx_lap` keeps track of the highest lap count where valid times have been computed.

- **Calling DFS**: Once the best times for all lap counts have been computed, the DFS function is called to calculate the minimum total time to complete `numLaps`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Precomputation of Times for Each Tire**: 
  - For each tire, we calculate the times for all laps from `1` to `numLaps`. Since there are `numLaps` laps and `n` tires, the complexity of this step is `O(n * numLaps)`.
- **DFS with Memoization**: 
  - The DFS function is called once for each lap count from `1` to `numLaps`. For each lap count, we explore possible tire combinations. Thus, the complexity of the DFS function is `O(numLaps * mx_lap)`, where `mx_lap` is the maximum number of laps considered.

The total time complexity is `O(n * numLaps + numLaps * mx_lap)`.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Memoization Arrays**: The `dp` and `best` arrays each have a size of `numLaps + 1`, so the space complexity is `O(numLaps)`.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the minimum time required to complete `numLaps` using the available tires. By using dynamic programming combined with DFS and memoization, the solution avoids recalculating results for overlapping subproblems, leading to significant time savings.

- **Optimization**: The precomputation step ensures that the best tire configuration for each lap count is known before the DFS is called, minimizing redundant computations.
- **Scalability**: With its time complexity of `O(n * numLaps + numLaps * mx_lap)`, the solution efficiently handles a reasonable number of tires and laps. The space complexity of `O(numLaps)` is also manageable for large inputs.

In summary, the solution provides a well-optimized approach to solving the tire selection problem, leveraging the power of dynamic programming to minimize the total time taken for all laps.
