### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed. After removing, return the new length of the array.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a pointer `i` to track the position where the next non-`val` element should be placed.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - Use a for-each loop to traverse through each element in `nums`.
   - For each element, check if it is not equal to `val`.

3. **Place Non-Val Elements**:
   - If an element is not equal to `val`, place it at the `i`-th position in the array and increment `i`.

4. **Return New Length**:
   - The value of `i` at the end of the loop will represent the new length of the modified array.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Pointer Initialization**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0, which will track the position for the next non-`val` element.
2. **Element Check**: Each element in `nums` is checked:
   - If it is not `val`, it is copied to the `i`-th index of the array.
   - `i` is incremented to point to the next position.
3. **Final Output**: After the loop, `i` contains the count of elements that are not `val`, effectively giving the new length of the array.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) since the operations are performed in place, and no additional space is used other than variables.
