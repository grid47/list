### Problem Statement
Determine if it is possible to transform the string `start` into the string `end` by moving the characters 'L' and 'R' to adjacent 'X' characters, while 'X' can occupy any position.

### Approach
1. **Filter Non-X Characters**:
   - Create two strings `s1` and `s2` by extracting all characters from `start` and `end` that are not 'X'.
   - If `s1` is not equal to `s2`, return `false` since the sequence of non-'X' characters must match.

2. **Two Pointer Technique**:
   - Initialize two pointers `p1` and `p2` to traverse `start` and `end` respectively.
   - Iterate through both strings:
     - Skip over 'X' characters using the pointers.
     - Check if both pointers have reached the end of their respective strings:
       - If both pointers reach the end, return `true`.
       - If one pointer reaches the end before the other, return `false`.
     - Compare the current non-'X' characters at the pointers:
       - If they differ, return `false`.
       - For 'L', ensure it does not move right; for 'R', ensure it does not move left:
         - If 'L' is found and its position in `end` is to the right of `start`, return `false`.
         - If 'R' is found and its position in `end` is to the left of `start`, return `false`.
   - If all checks are satisfied, return `true`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method for transforming the strings.

- **Method**:
  - `bool canTransform(string start, string end)`: Implements the logic to determine if the transformation is possible.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the strings, since it processes each character a limited number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the strings `s1` and `s2` that store non-'X' characters.
