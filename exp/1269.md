### Problem Statement
The goal of this problem is to determine the number of distinct ways to move from a starting position to return to that same position after a given number of steps, with the constraint that movements can only be made in left or right directions along a line. Specifically, given an integer `st` representing the starting position and an integer `n` representing the number of steps, we want to find out how many unique ways we can return to the starting position after taking exactly `n` steps.

### Approach
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently compute the number of ways to return to the starting position. The key idea is to use a recursive function with memoization to keep track of previously computed results, thereby avoiding redundant calculations. 

Here's a structured breakdown of the approach:
1. **Base Cases**: If we reach the starting position with no steps left, we have found a valid way to return, hence we return 1. If there are no steps left but we are not at the starting position, or if we exceed the bounds, we return 0.
2. **Recurrence Relation**: For each position, the number of ways to get to that position after taking `st` steps can be calculated by considering the three possible movements:
   - Move left to `idx - 1`
   - Stay at the same position (`idx`)
   - Move right to `idx + 1`
3. **Memoization**: Use a memoization table to store the results of previously computed states to optimize performance.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
    int n;
    vector<vector<int>> mem;
```
- **Lines 1-4**: We define the `Solution` class. An integer `mod` is initialized to \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow and to return results modulo this value. We declare variables `n` for the total number of positions and `mem` to store computed results for memoization.

```cpp
    int dp(int idx, int st) {
        // cout << idx << " " << st << "-";
        if(st == 0 && idx == 0) return 1;
        
        if(st == 0 || idx < 0 || idx >= n || st < idx) return 0;
```
- **Lines 5-10**: The recursive function `dp` takes two parameters: `idx` (the current position) and `st` (the remaining steps). 
  - The first base case checks if both steps and position are zero, which indicates a valid return to the start.
  - The second base case checks if steps are exhausted without returning to the start, or if the position goes out of bounds, in which case it returns 0.

```cpp
        if(mem[idx][st] != -1) return mem[idx][st];
```
- **Line 11**: We check if the current state has already been computed and stored in `mem`. If so, we return the stored result to avoid redundant calculations.

```cpp
        long ans = (long)dp(idx, st - 1) % mod + (long)dp(idx + 1, st - 1)% mod + (long)dp(idx - 1, st - 1)% mod;
```
- **Line 12**: The number of ways to get to `idx` after `st` steps is calculated by summing the ways from:
  - The current position with one less step,
  - The position to the right,
  - The position to the left.
- We cast the results to `long` to prevent overflow before applying the modulo operation.

```cpp
        return mem[idx][st] = ans % mod;
    }
```
- **Line 13**: We store the computed number of ways in `mem` before returning it, ensuring that our memoization structure retains the result for future reference.

```cpp
    int numWays(int st, int n) {
        mem.resize(st/2 + 1, vector<int>(st + 1, -1));
        this->n = n;
        return dp(0, st);
    }
};
```
- **Lines 14-18**: The main function `numWays` initializes the memoization table `mem` with dimensions based on the maximum possible steps and positions. The `dp` function is then called starting from the initial position (0) with the total number of steps (`st`).

### Complexity Analysis
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(st^2)\) because for each step, we potentially explore up to \(st\) positions, leading to a quadratic growth in calculations based on the number of steps.
2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is \(O(st)\) due to the memoization table, which stores results for up to \(st\) positions and steps.

### Conclusion
The `numWays` function effectively calculates the number of ways to return to a starting position after a specified number of steps using dynamic programming and memoization techniques. The approach ensures efficiency by avoiding recalculations through stored results, making it a scalable solution for larger input sizes. This method exemplifies how recursive problems can be transformed into efficient algorithms through clever state management and optimization techniques, which are essential skills in algorithm design and competitive programming.

Overall, the implementation is clean, utilizing C++ features such as `vector` for dynamic arrays and modular arithmetic for handling large numbers. The clarity of logic and structure allows for easy understanding and potential adaptations for related problems, solidifying its place as a robust solution in the coding landscape.
