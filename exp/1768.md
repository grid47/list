### Problem Statement

The problem is to merge two strings `w1` and `w2` alternately. The resulting string should take one character from `w1`, then one character from `w2`, and continue this pattern until all characters from both strings are included. If one string is longer than the other, the remaining characters of the longer string should be appended to the end of the merged string.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. The algorithm will use two pointers, one for each string, to track which characters have been added to the result. The steps of the approach are as follows:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Result**:
   - Create an empty string `res` to store the merged result.
   - Initialize two integer variables `i` and `j` to `0`, which will serve as indices for `w1` and `w2`, respectively.

2. **Iterate Until Both Strings Are Processed**:
   - Use a `while` loop that continues as long as there are remaining characters in either string.
   - Within the loop, check if there are remaining characters in `w1`:
     - If there are, append the character at index `i` from `w1` to `res`, and increment `i`.
   - Then, check if there are remaining characters in `w2`:
     - If there are, append the character at index `j` from `w2` to `res`, and increment `j`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing both strings, return the merged result stored in `res`.

This method efficiently combines the characters from both strings in the desired alternating fashion without needing any additional data structures or complex algorithms.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

The code is implemented in the `Solution` class with a public method `mergeAlternately`. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string w1, string w2) {
```
- The class `Solution` is defined, and the method `mergeAlternately` is declared, which takes two strings `w1` and `w2` as input.

```cpp
        string res = "";
        int i = 0, j = 0;
```
- An empty string `res` is initialized to hold the merged result.
- Two integer variables `i` and `j` are initialized to `0`. These will serve as indices for iterating through `w1` and `w2`, respectively.

```cpp
        while(i < w1.size() || j < w2.size()) {
```
- A `while` loop is used to continue processing until both strings have been completely traversed. The loop condition checks if either `i` is less than the size of `w1` or `j` is less than the size of `w2`.

```cpp
            if(i < w1.size()) {
                res += w1[i];
                i++;
            }
```
- Within the loop, the first `if` statement checks if there are remaining characters in `w1`. 
- If there are, the character at index `i` of `w1` is appended to `res`, and `i` is incremented to move to the next character.

```cpp
            if(j < w2.size()) {
                res += w2[j];
                j++;
            }
        }
```
- The second `if` statement checks if there are remaining characters in `w2`.
- If there are, the character at index `j` of `w2` is appended to `res`, and `j` is incremented.

```cpp
        return res;
    }
};
```
- After the loop completes (meaning all characters from both strings have been processed), the merged result stored in `res` is returned.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `w1` and \(m\) is the length of `w2`. The algorithm processes each character of both strings exactly once.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n + m)\) as well, since we are creating a new string `res` that stores the merged characters from both input strings.

### Conclusion

The `mergeAlternately` method effectively merges two strings in an alternating pattern using a straightforward iterative approach. The algorithm is efficient, with a linear time complexity relative to the combined lengths of the input strings.

This solution demonstrates a fundamental technique in string manipulation, making it applicable in various scenarios where merging or interleaving data is required. The simplicity of the approach, utilizing basic control structures and string operations, contributes to its clarity and effectiveness.

In summary, this implementation not only solves the problem at hand but also serves as a good example of how to handle string processing tasks in programming efficiently. Understanding and applying such methods can be beneficial for tackling similar problems in software development and competitive programming contexts.
