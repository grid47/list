### Problem Statement
Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, determine if `s2` is a scrambled version of `s1`. A scrambled string can be formed by recursively swapping non-empty substrings of `s1`.

### Approach
This solution uses recursion with memoization to reduce redundant computations:
1. **Base Case**: If `s1` is equal to `s2`, return `true` as they are trivially scrambled.
2. **Memoization Check**: If the pair `(s1, s2)` is already computed, return the stored result to avoid recalculating.
3. **Character Count Check**: Compare the character counts of `s1` and `s2`. If they donâ€™t match, return `false`.
4. **Recursive Scramble Check**: For each possible partition of `s1`:
   - Check if either of the partitions can match with `s2` by comparing segments directly or in a swapped order.
5. If none of the recursive checks pass, store `(s1, s2)` in the map as `false` and return `false`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Base Case**: `if (s1 == s2) return true;`
2. **Memoization Check**: `if (m.count(make_pair(s1, s2))) return m[make_pair(s1, s2)];`
3. **Character Count Check**: Using an array `count[26]`, iterate over characters of `s1` and `s2` to ensure they contain the same letters.
4. **Recursive Partitioning**: Iterate over possible partitions `i`, recursively check if they match either in normal or swapped order.
5. **Memoization Update**: If no match is found, store `(s1, s2)` as `false` in `m`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N^4)\) due to recursive partitioning and string copying in each call.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N^2)\) for storing results in `m`, where \(N\) is the length of the string.
