### Problem Statement
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. The sequence must be consecutive integers and can be in any order.

### Approach
1. **Use a Set**: Store the elements in a set to achieve O(1) time complexity for lookups.
2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - For each number in the array, check if it is the start of a new sequence.
   - A number is the start of a sequence if the number directly preceding it (i.e., `num - 1`) is not in the set.
3. **Count Consecutive Elements**:
   - If the current number is the start of a sequence, count how many consecutive numbers follow it by incrementing a counter and checking for the next numbers in the set.
4. **Update Maximum Length**: Keep track of the maximum length of consecutive sequences found during the iteration.

### Code Walk-through
- **`longestConsecutive` function**:
  - **Line 2-4**: Create a set to store the unique numbers from the input vector.
  - **Line 5**: Check if the set is empty; if it is, return 0 (no elements).
  - **Line 6**: Initialize a variable `mx` to track the maximum length of consecutive sequences.
  - **Line 7-17**: Loop through each number in the input:
    - **Line 8**: Get the current number and initialize a count `c` to 1.
    - **Line 9-14**: Check if the current number is the end of a sequence:
      - If `y + 1` is not in the set, count backwards for consecutive numbers and update the count `c`.
      - Update `mx` if the count `c` exceeds the current maximum.
  - **Line 16**: Return the maximum length of consecutive elements found.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in the input array. Each number is processed at most twice (once added to the set and once checked).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for storing the elements in the set.
