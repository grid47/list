### üöÄ Problem Statement

In this problem, we are given two jugs with capacities `x` and `y`, and we need to determine if it's possible to measure exactly `z` liters of water. You can perform the following operations:

- Fill a jug to its full capacity.
- Empty a jug.
- Pour water from one jug into the other until one of them is either full or empty.

The goal is to return `true` if it is possible to measure exactly `z` liters, and `false` otherwise.

### üß† Key Insights

To solve this, here are some important insights:
- **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)**: If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the jug capacities `x` and `y` divides `z`, then it's possible to measure `z` liters. This is because of the properties of Diophantine equations, which tell us that we can only measure quantities that are multiples of the gcd of the two jugs.
- **Capacity Check**: The combined capacity of both jugs (`x + y`) must be greater than or equal to `z`, since you can't measure more water than the total capacity of the jugs.

### üõ†Ô∏è Approach

We can solve this problem in a few steps:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the total capacity of the jugs (`x + y`) is less than `z`, it's immediately impossible to measure `z` liters. In this case, return `false`.
   - If either jug already contains exactly `z` liters (i.e., `x == z` or `y == z`), we can immediately return `true`.
   - If the sum of both jugs equals `z` (i.e., `x + y == z`), we can also return `true`, because we can simply combine both jugs to reach the target.

2. **GCD Condition**:
   - If none of the above conditions are true, we calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y`.
   - If `z` is divisible by the gcd of `x` and `y` (`z % gcd(x, y) == 0`), it means it's possible to measure exactly `z` liters. Otherwise, return `false`.

### üî® Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Let‚Äôs break it down:

#### Step 1: Initial Checks

```cpp
if(x + y < z) return false;
if(x == z || y == z || x + y == z) return true;
```
- **Step 1a**: Check if the total capacity of both jugs is less than `z`. If so, return `false`.
- **Step 1b**: Check if either jug contains exactly `z` liters (i.e., `x == z` or `y == z`), or if the sum of both jugs equals `z`. If so, return `true`.

#### Step 2: GCD Condition

```cpp
return z % gcd(x, y) == 0;
```
- If none of the above conditions hold, calculate the gcd of `x` and `y`. If `z` is divisible by this gcd, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

#### Step 3: GCD Calculation

```cpp
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}
```
- The gcd function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor. If `b` is zero, `a` is the gcd. Otherwise, we recursively compute `gcd(b, a % b)` until `b` becomes zero.

### üìà Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: The most time-consuming operation is the calculation of the gcd. Using the Euclidean algorithm, the time complexity is **O(log(min(x, y)))**, where `x` and `y` are the capacities of the jugs.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)** since we only use a few integer variables and no additional data structures.

### üèÅ Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the water jug problem by leveraging the mathematical properties of the greatest common divisor. By breaking the problem down into a series of simple checks and using the gcd to determine whether `z` liters can be measured, we ensure optimal performance with minimal space usage.

**In a nutshell**: If the sum of the jugs is greater than or equal to `z` and `z` is divisible by the gcd of the two jugs, it‚Äôs possible to measure exactly `z` liters. This approach guarantees a solution in logarithmic time and constant space.

### üåü Quick Recap

- Check if the combined capacity of the jugs is sufficient.
- Verify if the target amount `z` is directly achievable via one of the jugs.
- Use the gcd to check if `z` is a multiple of the gcd of `x` and `y`.
- Time complexity is **O(log(min(x, y)))** and space complexity is **O(1)**.
