### Problem Statement
You have two jugs with capacities \( x \) and \( y \) liters, and you want to measure exactly \( z \) liters of water. The task is to determine if it is possible to measure exactly \( z \) liters using the two jugs.

### Approach
1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the total capacity of the two jugs \( (x + y) \) is less than \( z \), it is impossible to measure \( z \) liters, so return `false`.
   - If either jug has a capacity equal to \( z \), or if the total capacity of both jugs is exactly \( z \), return `true`.

2. **GCD Check**:
   - If \( z \) is less than the total capacity, check if \( z \) can be expressed as a linear combination of \( x \) and \( y \). This can be done using the greatest common divisor (GCD):
     - If \( z \) is divisible by the GCD of \( x \) and \( y \) (i.e., \( z \mod \text{gcd}(x, y) == 0 \)), then it is possible to measure \( z \) liters; otherwise, it is not.

3. **GCD Function**:
   - A helper function `gcd(int a, int b)` is implemented using the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD of two integers.

### Code Walk-through
- The main function `canMeasureWater` checks the conditions outlined above:
  - It returns `false` if \( x + y < z \).
  - It returns `true` if either jug matches \( z \) or if their sum equals \( z \).
  - Finally, it checks the divisibility condition using the GCD function.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(\log(\min(x, y))) \) due to the GCD calculation.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \) since only a constant amount of space is used.
