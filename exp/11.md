### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `height` representing the height of vertical lines on a Cartesian plane, find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that holds the most water. Return the maximum amount of water that can be contained.

### Approach
Use a two-pointer technique to maximize the area by evaluating the potential area formed by the lines at the two pointers and moving the pointer that points to the shorter line inward.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Set `res` to 0 to keep track of the maximum area found.
   - Initialize two pointers: `i` at the start (0) and `j` at the end of the `height` array.

2. **While Loop**:
   - Continue iterating as long as `i` is less than `j`:
     - Calculate the area formed between the lines at the two pointers using the formula:
       \[
       \text{Area} = \min(\text{height}[i], \text{height}[j]) \times (j - i)
       \]
     - Update `res` with the maximum area found so far.
     - Move the pointer corresponding to the shorter line inward:
       - If `height[i]` is less than `height[j]`, increment `i` to consider the next line on the left.
       - Otherwise, decrement `j` to consider the next line on the right.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After exiting the loop, return the maximum area stored in `res`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) - where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `height` array, since each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) - no additional space is used beyond a few variables.
