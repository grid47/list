### Problem Statement
Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) represented as an adjacency list `graph`, return all possible paths from the source node (0) to the target node (n - 1).

### Approach
1. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - `ans`: A vector to store all valid paths from source to target.
   - `q`: A queue to facilitate breadth-first search (BFS) for exploring paths in the graph.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Start by pushing the source node (0) and the path containing just this node into the queue.
   - While the queue is not empty:
     - Extract the front element, which contains the current node (`x`) and the path taken to reach it (`t`).
     - If the current node is the target node (last node in the graph), add the path `t` to `ans`.
     - For each neighboring node (`k`) in the adjacency list of the current node, append `k` to the path `t`, and push the new state (next node and updated path) into the queue.
     - After exploring the neighbor, backtrack by popping `k` from the path to restore the previous state for the next iteration.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, return the vector `ans`, which contains all the paths from the source to the target.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to find all paths from source to target.
    - `vector<vector<int>> allPathsSourceTarget(vector<vector<int>>& graph)`: Implements the logic for pathfinding.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `graph`: A vector of vectors representing the adjacency list of the graph.
      - **Returns**: A vector of vectors containing all possible paths from the source to the target.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n), where n is the number of nodes in the graph, due to the exponential number of paths in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the paths and the queue in the BFS traversal.
