### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find the winners and the losers of a series of matches in a tournament. Each match has two players: one is the winner, and the other is the loser. The task is to return two lists:
1. The first list should contain players who never lost any match (i.e., they won all their matches).
2. The second list should contain players who lost exactly one match.

We are given a list of `matches` where each match is represented as a pair of integers `[winner, loser]`. We need to efficiently calculate which players meet the criteria of never losing and losing exactly one match.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can take the following approach:
1. **Track All Players**: We need to keep track of all players involved in the matches (both winners and losers).
2. **Track Losses**: For each player, track how many times they have lost. This will help us identify players who have lost exactly once and those who have never lost.
3. **Organize Players into Groups**: Once the losses are counted, we can classify players into two categories:
   - Players who have never lost a match.
   - Players who have lost exactly one match.
4. **Return the Results**: Sort both lists and return them in the required order.

We will use an `unordered_set` to store all unique players and a `map` to count the number of losses for each player. Finally, we will iterate through the players, sorting them based on the criteria, and return the results as two lists.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize Containers
```cpp
unordered_set<int> u;
map<int, int> ff;
int n = matches.size();
```
- `u` is an unordered set to store all unique players from the matches. This ensures we have a list of every player, whether they are a winner or a loser.
- `ff` is a map that keeps track of the number of losses for each player. The key is the player ID, and the value is the number of losses that player has.
- `n` stores the number of matches, which is the size of the `matches` vector.

#### Step 2: Populate the Containers
```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    u.insert(matches[i][0]);
    u.insert(matches[i][1]);
    ff[matches[i][1]]++;
}
```
- The loop iterates over each match in the `matches` vector.
- `matches[i][0]` is the winner, and `matches[i][1]` is the loser of the current match.
- We insert both the winner and the loser into the `unordered_set` `u` to ensure all players are accounted for.
- We increment the count of losses for the loser in the map `ff`.

#### Step 3: Classify Players Based on Losses
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> arr(2);
for(auto it = u.begin(); it != u.end(); it++) {
    if(!ff.count(*it)) arr[0].push_back(*it);
    else if(ff[*it] == 1) arr[1].push_back(*it);
}
```
- `arr` is a 2D vector with two lists:
  - `arr[0]` will store players who have never lost a match.
  - `arr[1]` will store players who have lost exactly one match.
- The loop iterates through all the players in `u`.
  - If a player does not appear in the `ff` map, it means they have never lost a match, so we add them to `arr[0]`.
  - If a player has exactly one loss (i.e., `ff[*it] == 1`), we add them to `arr[1]`.

#### Step 4: Sort the Results
```cpp
sort(arr[0].begin(), arr[0].end());
sort(arr[1].begin(), arr[1].end());
```
- After categorizing the players, we sort both `arr[0]` and `arr[1]` in ascending order. This ensures that the players are listed in sorted order in the final result.

#### Step 5: Return the Final Results
```cpp
return arr;
```
- Finally, we return the 2D vector `arr` containing the two lists: one for players who never lost and one for players who lost exactly once.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)** for iterating over the `matches` vector and populating the unordered set `u` and map `ff`. The time complexity for inserting into an unordered set or a map is on average O(1).
- **O(m log m)** for sorting both `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`, where `m` is the total number of unique players (which is at most 2n, since each match involves two players).
- Overall time complexity: **O(n + m log m)**, where `n` is the number of matches and `m` is the number of unique players involved in those matches.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(m)** for storing the unique players in the unordered set `u`.
- **O(m)** for storing the loss count in the map `ff`.
- **O(m)** for storing the two result lists in `arr`.
- Overall space complexity: **O(m)**, where `m` is the number of unique players.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the problem by using a combination of an unordered set and a map. It tracks all players and counts their losses to identify those who never lost and those who lost exactly once. The approach has an optimal time complexity of **O(n + m log m)**, where `n` is the number of matches and `m` is the number of unique players. The solution also ensures that the results are returned in sorted order, which is required by the problem statement.

The space complexity is **O(m)**, which is efficient for the problem, as it only stores the necessary information about players and their losses. This solution is well-suited for handling large input sizes and provides a clear, concise method for solving the problem.
