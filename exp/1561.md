### Problem Statement

The problem involves a strategic game where players pick coins from piles to maximize their total coin collection. Given an array `piles`, where each element represents the number of coins in a pile, the goal is to determine the maximum number of coins one player can collect. The game follows these rules:
1. Players can only take coins in rounds, and each player picks one pile during their turn.
2. The player can only collect coins after every other player has taken their turn, meaning they can only take coins in every second turn of the game.
3. The game continues until no more coins can be picked based on the total number of piles.

The objective is to compute the maximum coins that the player can collect based on the distribution of coins across the piles.

### Approach

The solution employs a greedy strategy to maximize the number of coins collected by the player. The following steps outline the approach:

1. **Find the Maximum Value**: Determine the maximum number of coins in any pile to set the range for frequency counting.

2. **Frequency Count**: Create a frequency array that counts how many piles contain each possible number of coins.

3. **Coin Collection Logic**: Use a loop to simulate the collection of coins:
   - The player can only collect coins in every second turn.
   - For each turn, check if the current maximum pile has coins available. If so, reduce its count and add its value to the player's total coins collected. 
   - Adjust the turn counter and decrease the chance counter accordingly.

4. **Return Result**: Once the player can no longer collect coins (when the `chance` counter reaches zero), return the total coins collected.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the code, explaining each section:

- **Class Declaration**:
    The solution is encapsulated within a class named `Solution`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
```

- **Function Definition**:
    The `maxCoins` function is defined, taking a vector of integers (`piles`) as input and returning an integer representing the maximum coins collectible.

```cpp
int maxCoins(vector<int>& piles) {
```

- **Initialization**:
    A variable `max` is initialized to zero, and the size of the `piles` vector (`n`) is determined.

```cpp
int max = 0;
int n = piles.size();
```

- **Finding Maximum Value**:
    A loop iterates through the `piles` vector to find the maximum number of coins in any pile.

```cpp
for (int i : piles) {
    if (max < i) max = i;
}
```

- **Frequency Array**:
    A frequency array `freq` is created to count the occurrences of each coin count in the piles.

```cpp
vector<int> freq(max + 1, 0);
for (int i : piles) {
    freq[i]++;
}
```

- **Coin Collection Variables**:
    Initialize variables to keep track of the total coins collected (`coins`), the number of chances (`chance`), the turn indicator (`turn`), and an index `i` starting from the maximum value.

```cpp
int coins = 0;
int chance = n / 3;
int turn = 1;
int i = max;
```

- **Coin Collection Loop**:
    The main loop continues until there are no more chances to collect coins.

```cpp
while (chance != 0) {
```

- **Collecting Coins**:
    Inside the loop, check if there are coins in the current maximum pile (`freq[i]`). If there are:
    - Toggle the `turn` variable.
    - If it’s the player’s turn (when `turn == 1`), skip to the next iteration. Otherwise, collect the coins, reduce the pile count, and decrease the `chance` counter.

```cpp
if (freq[i] > 0) {
    if (turn == 1) turn = 0;
    else {
        chance--;
        turn = 1;
        coins += i;
    }
    freq[i]--;
} else {
    i--;
}
```

- **Return Statement**:
    Once the loop concludes (when `chance` reaches zero), the total coins collected is returned.

```cpp
return coins;
}
```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the number of piles and \(m\) is the maximum value of coins in any pile. The `O(n)` accounts for populating the frequency array, while `O(m)` accounts for iterating through possible pile values.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(m)\) due to the frequency array used to count occurrences of coin counts.

### Conclusion

The `maxCoins` function offers an efficient solution to the problem of maximizing coin collection from piles. By employing a greedy algorithm, the function effectively calculates the optimal strategy for selecting coins while adhering to the game’s turn rules. The combination of frequency counting and controlled collection simulates the strategic choices that a player would make in such a game.

Understanding this solution can enhance one’s algorithmic skills, particularly in the areas of greedy strategies and array manipulations. This approach serves as a reference for tackling similar problems involving optimization in competitive programming scenarios, showcasing how to efficiently navigate through a collection of items to achieve the best outcome. The algorithm's clarity and performance make it an excellent choice for developers looking to implement coin collection strategies or similar game mechanics in their applications.
