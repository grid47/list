### Problem Statement
The problem involves an array of integers and an integer \( k \). The goal is to partition the array into contiguous subarrays of size at most \( k \) such that the sum of each subarray is maximized. The sum of each partition is defined as the maximum element in that partition multiplied by the size of that partition. The objective is to find the maximum possible sum after performing the partitioning.

### Approach
To tackle this problem, we utilize a dynamic programming approach. The main idea is to keep track of the best possible sum we can obtain starting from each index in the array.

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We maintain a memoization array `memo` to store the maximum sum for each index to avoid redundant calculations.

2. **Recursion with Memoization**: The function `dp(i)` computes the maximum sum starting from index `i` and considers partitions of size up to `k`.

3. **Iterative Calculation of Maximums**: For each starting index, we calculate the maximum value of the subarrays, updating the results as we expand the size of the subarray.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Class Definition**: The code is wrapped in a class named `Solution`.

   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
   ```

2. **Member Variables**:
   - `memo`: A vector to store results of computed states to facilitate memoization.
   - `arr`: The input array passed to the function.
   - `k`: The maximum allowed size of any subarray.

   ```cpp
   vector<int> memo;
   vector<int> arr;
   int k;
   ```

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - The `dp(int i)` function calculates the maximum sum starting from index `i`.
   - It first checks if it has reached the end of the array; if so, it returns 0.

   ```cpp
   int dp(int i) {
       if(i == arr.size()) return 0;
   ```

4. **Memoization Check**:
   - If the result for the current index `i` is already computed (i.e., not equal to -1), it returns that result.

   ```cpp
       if(memo[i] != -1) return memo[i];
   ```

5. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - Two variables `res` and `mx` are initialized to track the best result and the maximum value of the current subarray, respectively.
   - A loop iterates from the current index `i` to the smaller of the array size or \( i + k \) (to ensure subarrays do not exceed size \( k \)).

   ```cpp
       int res = 0, mx = 0;
       for(int j = i; j < min((int)arr.size(), i + k); j++) {
           mx = max(mx, arr[j]);
           res = max(res, mx * (j - i + 1) + dp(j + 1));
       }
   ```

6. **Updating Memoization**:
   - The maximum result for the current index is stored in `memo[i]` for future reference.

   ```cpp
       return memo[i] = res;
   ```

7. **Main Function**:
   - The `maxSumAfterPartitioning(vector<int>& arr, int k)` function initializes member variables and starts the recursive process from index 0.

   ```cpp
   int maxSumAfterPartitioning(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
       this->arr = arr;
       this->k = k;
       memo.resize(arr.size(), -1);
       return dp(0);
   }
   ```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \cdot k)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array. For each index, we consider partitions of length up to \(k\). The memoization helps in optimizing repeated calls to the same index.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the `memo` vector and the function call stack for recursion.

### Conclusion
The provided code effectively solves the problem of maximizing the sum after partitioning an array. By employing a dynamic programming approach with memoization, it ensures that each state is computed only once, leading to efficient execution.

The algorithm iteratively evaluates potential partitions, maintaining the maximum value of each subarray. This guarantees that the solution adheres to the constraints of the problem while providing an optimal result.

In summary, the `maxSumAfterPartitioning` function demonstrates how dynamic programming can be leveraged to solve complex problems involving partitioning and optimization. The approach not only provides an efficient solution but also serves as a practical example of applying recursion and memoization in algorithm design.

The code exemplifies best practices in competitive programming and algorithm development, offering clarity and efficiency that can be utilized in various contexts involving similar problems.
