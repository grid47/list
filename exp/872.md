### Problem Statement
Given two binary trees, you need to determine if the leaves of the two trees are similar. The leaves of a tree are defined as the nodes that do not have any children. Two trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf values, in order from left to right, are the same.

### Approach
1. **Use Stacks for Iteration**: We will use two stacks to traverse the trees. This allows us to perform a depth-first search (DFS) without recursion.

2. **DFS for Leaves**: The helper function `dfs` will be used to find the next leaf in the tree:
   - Pop nodes from the stack until a leaf node is found. If the popped node has children, push them onto the stack.
   - Return the value of the leaf node.

3. **Compare Leaves**:
   - While both stacks are not empty, repeatedly call `dfs` to get the next leaf from each tree.
   - If the leaf values are different at any point, return `false`.
   - If one stack is empty before the other, the trees are not leaf-similar.

4. **Final Check**: After exiting the loop, check if both stacks are empty, confirming that both trees have the same number of leaves.

### Code Walk-through
- The `leafSimilar` function initializes two stacks and pushes the root nodes of both trees.
- It compares the leaves found by `dfs` until either stack is empty.
- The function concludes by checking if both trees are exhausted simultaneously.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where \( n \) is the total number of nodes in both trees. In the worst case, all nodes are leaves.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where \( h \) is the height of the taller tree, due to the stack space used for the DFS traversal.
