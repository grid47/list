### Problem Statement
Given a `n x n` grid where each element is either `0` or `1`, construct a QuadTree to represent the grid. A QuadTree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children corresponding to the four quadrants of a 2D space.

### Approach
1. **QuadTree Node Definition**: Each node has:
   - A boolean value `val` representing whether the region it covers is filled with `1` (true) or `0` (false).
   - A boolean `isLeaf` indicating if the node is a leaf node (i.e., it represents a single color).
   - Pointers to its four children: `topLeft`, `topRight`, `bottomLeft`, and `bottomRight`.

2. **Recursive Construction**:
   - Use a helper function to construct the QuadTree recursively.
   - Base Case: If the size of the current region (`sz`) is `1`, create a leaf node using the value of the single cell.
   - Recursive Case:
     - Divide the current grid into four quadrants and call the helper function for each quadrant.
     - If all four child nodes are leaf nodes and have the same value, merge them into a single leaf node. Otherwise, keep the four children.

3. **Merging Logic**: After constructing the child nodes:
   - Check if all children are leaf nodes and have the same value. If so, set the current node as a leaf with that value; otherwise, link the children to the current node.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Construct Function**: Initializes the QuadTree construction by calling the helper function with the full grid.
2. **Helper Function**:
   - Checks for base case (single cell) and creates a leaf node if true.
   - Recursively creates the four child nodes by dividing the grid.
   - Merges nodes if all child nodes are leaf nodes with the same value; otherwise, links the child nodes.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) where `n` is the dimension of the grid, since each cell is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(log(n)) for the recursive call stack in the worst case, assuming the tree is balanced. The space for the tree itself depends on the number of distinct regions in the grid.
