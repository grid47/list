### Problem Statement
You are climbing a staircase with `n` steps. You can take either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Determine how many distinct ways you can climb to the top of the staircase.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Create a vector `dp` of size `n + 1` to store the number of ways to reach each step. The element `dp[i]` will represent the number of distinct ways to reach the `i`-th step.
2. **Base Cases**: 
   - There is 1 way to stay at the ground (0 steps), so set `dp[0] = 1`.
   - There is also 1 way to climb to the first step (1 step), so set `dp[1] = 1`.
3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each step from 2 to `n`, calculate the number of ways to reach that step:
   - The number of ways to reach step `i` is the sum of the ways to reach steps `i-1` (taking a single step) and `i-2` (taking two steps). Thus, use the relation:  
     \[
     dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
     \]
4. **Return Result**: The value at `dp[n]` will give the total distinct ways to reach the top of the staircase.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: A vector `dp` is initialized with zeros, and the base cases are set.
2. **Loop Through Steps**: A loop iterates from step 2 to `n`, updating the `dp` array based on the previous two values.
3. **Final Output**: Return the value stored in `dp[n]`, which represents the number of ways to reach the `n`-th step.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of steps, as we compute the value for each step from 2 to `n`.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \), for the dynamic programming array used to store intermediate results.
