### Problem Statement
Given a directed graph represented as an adjacency list, the task is to find all the nodes that are "eventually safe." A node is considered safe if every path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (a node with no outgoing edges).

### Approach
1. **Initialize Structures**:
   - Create a result vector `res` to store the safe nodes.
   - Get the size of the graph `n`.
   - Create a visitation status vector `vis` of size `n`, initialized to 0:
     - 0: Not visited
     - 1: Visiting
     - 2: Visited (safe)

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - For each node `i`, invoke the DFS function to determine if the node is safe:
     - If the DFS returns `true`, add the node to the result vector `res`.

3. **DFS Function Logic**:
   - In the `dfs` function:
     - Check if the current node has been visited:
       - If `vis[cur] == 2`, the node is safe, so return `true`.
       - If `vis[cur] == 1`, a cycle is detected, so return `false`.
     - Mark the current node as being visited (`vis[cur] = 1`).
     - Recursively visit all adjacent nodes:
       - If any adjacent node is not safe, return `false`.
     - Mark the current node as safe (`vis[cur] = 2`).
     - Return `true`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - Return the vector `res` containing all the eventual safe nodes.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to identify eventual safe nodes.
    - `vector<int> eventualSafeNodes(vector<vector<int>>& graph)`: Implements the logic for finding safe nodes.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `graph`: A vector of vectors representing the directed graph's adjacency list.
      - **Returns**: A vector of integers representing the eventual safe nodes.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges. Each node and edge is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V), for the visitation status vector and the recursion stack in the DFS.
