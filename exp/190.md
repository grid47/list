### Problem Statement
Given a 32-bit unsigned integer `n`, reverse its bits and return the resulting integer. 

### Approach
1. **Bit Manipulation**:
   - The approach uses bitwise operations to reverse the bits in groups. This involves shifting bits and applying masks to isolate specific bits.

2. **Step-by-Step Reversal**:
   - **Step 1**: Swap the first 16 bits with the last 16 bits.
   - **Step 2**: Swap the bytes within the two halves.
   - **Step 3**: Swap the nibbles (4 bits).
   - **Step 4**: Swap pairs of bits.
   - **Step 5**: Swap individual bits.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the class `Solution`.
- **Line 2**: Define the `reverseBits` function, which takes an unsigned 32-bit integer `n`.
- **Lines 3-7**: Apply a series of bitwise operations to reverse the bits in `n` using masks:
  - `n = (n & 0xffffffff) << 16 | (n & 0xffffffff) >> 16;` — swaps the first 16 bits with the last 16 bits.
  - `n = (n & 0x00ff00ff) << 8  | (n & 0xff00ff00) >> 8;` — swaps bytes within the two halves.
  - `n = (n & 0x0f0f0f0f) << 4  | (n & 0xf0f0f0f0) >> 4;` — swaps nibbles.
  - `n = (n & 0x33333333) << 2  | (n & 0xcccccccc) >> 2;` — swaps pairs of bits.
  - `n = (n & 0x55555555) << 1  | (n & 0aaaaaaaa) >> 1;` — swaps individual bits.
- **Line 8**: Return the reversed bits.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as the number of operations is constant (a fixed number of bit manipulations).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as the operations are performed in-place without requiring additional space.
