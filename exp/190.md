### Problem Statement

The task is to reverse the bits of a given 32-bit unsigned integer. Given an integer `n`, we are required to return the number formed by reversing its binary representation. For instance, if the binary of `n` is `00000010100101000001111010011100`, after reversing the bits, the result should be `00111001011110000010100101000000`.

#### Example:

- Input: `n = 43261596` (in decimal, binary representation: `00000010100101000001111010011100`)
- Output: `964176192` (in decimal, binary representation: `00111001011110000010100101000000`)

### Approach

The problem asks for reversing the bits in a 32-bit unsigned integer, which means flipping the bit order from the least significant bit to the most significant bit (or vice versa). The brute force approach of simply converting the number to a binary string, reversing it, and then converting it back to an integer can be inefficient in terms of both time and space. Therefore, a more optimal approach uses bitwise operations.

The approach involves using **bit manipulation** to perform the reversal efficiently. The solution divides the bit-reversal task into smaller chunks using bitwise masks and shifts. The idea is to iteratively reverse smaller portions of the bits (e.g., pairs of bits, 4 bits, 8 bits, etc.), which progressively moves towards a fully reversed 32-bit value.

The steps can be summarized as follows:

1. **Pairwise Reversal**: Swap adjacent pairs of bits.
2. **Nibbles Reversal**: Swap nibbles (4 bits at a time).
3. **Bytes Reversal**: Swap bytes (8 bits at a time).
4. **16-bit Blocks Reversal**: Swap 16-bit blocks at a time.
5. **Final Reversal**: After performing the above steps, the full 32-bit number will be reversed.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

The code utilizes bitwise operations to perform the bit reversal in an efficient manner:

```cpp
uint32_t reverseBits(uint32_t n) {
    // Step 1: Swap 16-bit blocks
    n = (n & 0xffffffff) << 16 | (n & 0xffffffff) >> 16;
    
    // Step 2: Swap 8-bit blocks
    n = (n & 0x00ff00ff) << 8 | (n & 0xff00ff00) >> 8;
    
    // Step 3: Swap 4-bit blocks
    n = (n & 0x0f0f0f0f) << 4 | (n & 0xf0f0f0f0) >> 4;
    
    // Step 4: Swap 2-bit blocks
    n = (n & 0x33333333) << 2 | (n & 0xcccccccc) >> 2;
    
    // Step 5: Swap individual bits
    n = (n & 0x55555555) << 1 | (n & 0xaaaaaaaa) >> 1;
    
    return n;
}
```

Let's break down each line of the code to understand its function:

#### 1. Swapping 16-bit blocks:

```cpp
n = (n & 0xffffffff) << 16 | (n & 0xffffffff) >> 16;
```

This operation works on the entire 32-bit number. The first part, `n & 0xffffffff`, is essentially redundant because `0xffffffff` is a mask that leaves all bits unchanged. The key operation here is shifting the lower half of the bits (the right 16 bits) to the left and the upper half of the bits (the left 16 bits) to the right. This effectively swaps the two 16-bit halves of the number.

#### 2. Swapping 8-bit blocks:

```cpp
n = (n & 0x00ff00ff) << 8 | (n & 0xff00ff00) >> 8;
```

In this step, we focus on swapping 8-bit chunks (also known as nibbles) of the number. The mask `0x00ff00ff` isolates the lower 8 bits of every 16-bit block. Shifting these bits 8 positions to the left moves the lower byte to the higher byte's position. Similarly, the mask `0xff00ff00` isolates the higher 8 bits, and they are shifted 8 positions to the right.

#### 3. Swapping 4-bit blocks:

```cpp
n = (n & 0x0f0f0f0f) << 4 | (n & 0xf0f0f0f0) >> 4;
```

This operation targets 4-bit blocks within the 32-bit number. The mask `0x0f0f0f0f` isolates the lower 4 bits in each 8-bit group. By shifting them 4 positions to the left, the lower nibble is moved to the upper nibble's position. Similarly, `0xf0f0f0f0` isolates the upper 4 bits, and they are shifted 4 positions to the right.

#### 4. Swapping 2-bit blocks:

```cpp
n = (n & 0x33333333) << 2 | (n & 0xcccccccc) >> 2;
```

Here, the operation works at the granularity of 2-bit blocks. The mask `0x33333333` isolates pairs of bits, and these are shifted 2 positions to the left. The mask `0xcccccccc` isolates the other pair of bits, and they are shifted 2 positions to the right.

#### 5. Swapping individual bits:

```cpp
n = (n & 0x55555555) << 1 | (n & 0xaaaaaaaa) >> 1;
```

Finally, this step swaps adjacent individual bits in the 32-bit integer. The mask `0x55555555` isolates the odd-numbered bits, and they are shifted to the left. The mask `0xaaaaaaaa` isolates the even-numbered bits, and they are shifted to the right.

At this point, the entire 32-bit number has been reversed.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The time complexity is constant, as the number of operations required to reverse the bits does not depend on the size of the input number. Each operation works on a fixed number of bits (32 bits), and thus, the number of operations is fixed and independent of the input.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is also constant, as the algorithm only uses a few extra variables and does not require additional space that scales with the input.

### Conclusion

This solution leverages **bitwise operations** to efficiently reverse the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer. By breaking down the reversal process into smaller steps (swapping 16-bit blocks, 8-bit blocks, etc.), the solution performs the reversal in a constant time complexity of **O(1)**, which is optimal for this problem. The algorithm operates in-place with constant space complexity **O(1)**, making it both time and space efficient. This approach is ideal for problems involving bit manipulations, where performance is a priority.
