### Problem Statement
Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions surrounded by 'X'. A region is captured if all 'O's in that region are completely surrounded by 'X's.

### Approach
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Traverse the borders of the board and use DFS to mark all 'O's that are connected to the borders (i.e., the 'O's that should not be captured).
   - Mark these 'O's temporarily as '1' to differentiate them from the 'X's.

2. **Post DFS Processing**:
   - After marking, iterate through the board:
     - Convert all remaining 'O's (not connected to the borders) to 'X' since they are surrounded.
     - Convert all '1's back to 'O', restoring the originally un-captured regions.

### Code Walk-through
- **`solve` function**:
  - **Line 2-3**: Get the dimensions of the board (`m` for rows and `n` for columns).
  - **Line 4-8**: Loop through all border elements:
    - For each 'O' found on the border, initiate a DFS.
- **Inner Loop**: Check if the current element is on the border and if it's 'O'.
  
- **Line 10-15**: Post DFS processing:
  - Convert remaining 'O's to 'X'.
  - Convert '1's back to 'O'.
  
- **`dfs` function**:
  - **Line 17-30**: Perform DFS:
    - Check for boundary conditions and if the current cell is 'O'.
    - Mark the current 'O' as '1' to indicate it is connected to the border.
    - Recursively call DFS for all four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(M \times N)\), where \(M\) is the number of rows and \(N\) is the number of columns, since we may visit every cell in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(M \times N)\) due to the call stack in the worst case during DFS, but typically it would be much lower depending on the board's configuration.
