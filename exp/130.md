### Problem Statement

The problem is to solve a classic board game scenario where the board is a grid of characters, and we are tasked with finding and modifying certain regions of the board. The board consists of 'X' and 'O' characters, where 'O' represents regions of interest. The goal is to modify the board such that any 'O' that is **completely surrounded** by 'X' characters (i.e., it cannot connect to the boundary of the board) should be changed to 'X'. However, any 'O' that is **connected to the boundary** (either directly or indirectly) should remain unchanged.

### Problem Example

Given the following board:

```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```

After applying the solution, the board should be modified as follows:

```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```

### Approach

This problem can be solved using a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to explore the 'O' regions connected to the boundary. The key idea is:

1. **Boundary Identification**: First, identify all 'O' characters that are connected to the boundary of the board. These should not be flipped to 'X', as they are considered safe.
2. **Mark Safe Regions**: Use DFS to traverse all 'O' cells that are connected to any boundary. We mark these cells temporarily (with a different character, e.g., '1') to avoid modifying them in the next step.
3. **Flipping Surrounded Regions**: After marking all the safe regions, we iterate over the entire board. Any 'O' that wasn't marked (i.e., is surrounded by 'X') should be flipped to 'X'. Any cell marked as '1' should be restored back to 'O' since it was part of a safe region.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: **Solve Function**
```cpp
void solve(vector<vector<char>>& board)
```
The `solve` function is the main function that processes the entire board. It first identifies and marks the 'O' regions that are connected to the boundary, and then flips the 'O' characters that are completely surrounded by 'X' characters.

1. **Initialize Board Dimensions**:
   ```cpp
   int m = board.size(), n = board[0].size();
   ```
   Here, `m` and `n` represent the number of rows and columns of the board, respectively.

2. **Mark Boundary Connected 'O' Regions**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
   for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
       if(i == 0 || j == 0 || i == m - 1 || j == n - 1)
           if(board[i][j] == 'O')
               dfs(board, i, j);
   ```
   This double loop checks all cells in the first and last rows and columns (i.e., the boundary). If an 'O' is found on the boundary, the `dfs` function is called to explore all connected 'O' cells.

3. **Flip the Surrounded 'O' Regions**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
   for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
       if(board[i][j] == 'O')
           board[i][j] = 'X';
       else if(board[i][j] == '1')
           board[i][j] = 'O';
   ```
   This loop traverses the entire board:
   - If a 'O' is found that wasn't marked as '1', it is flipped to 'X'.
   - If a cell is marked as '1', it means it was part of a boundary-connected 'O' region, so it is restored back to 'O'.

#### Step 2: **DFS Function**
```cpp
void dfs(vector<vector<char>> &grid, int i, int j) {
    if(i < 0 || j < 0 || i == grid.size() || 
       j == grid[0].size() || grid[i][j] != 'O')
        return;
    grid[i][j] = '1';
    dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
    dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
    dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
    dfs(grid, i, j - 1);
}
```
- The `dfs` function is a recursive function that explores all the 'O' cells connected to a given cell `(i, j)`.
- The base case ensures that the search does not go out of bounds or revisit cells that are not 'O'.
- If an 'O' is found, it is temporarily marked as '1' to indicate that it is part of a region connected to the boundary.
- The DFS continues to explore the four directions (up, down, left, right) to mark all connected 'O' cells.

### Time Complexity

- **DFS Traversal**: The DFS function is called at most once for each 'O' cell in the grid. Since each cell in the grid is visited once and each DFS operation performs a constant amount of work for each cell, the time complexity of DFS is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: Since we call DFS on each boundary 'O' and then perform a traversal to flip or restore 'O' cells, the overall time complexity is `O(m * n)`.

### Space Complexity

- **Space for DFS Stack**: The depth of the DFS recursion stack can be as large as the number of 'O' cells connected to the boundary. In the worst case, the space complexity is `O(m * n)` for the recursive stack.
- **Space for Board Modifications**: The board itself is modified in-place, so no extra space is required for storing the grid. Hence, the space complexity is `O(1)` for in-place modification, excluding the recursion stack.

### Conclusion

The solution efficiently solves the "Surrounded Regions" problem by using DFS to explore and mark regions connected to the boundary. By temporarily marking the connected regions, we ensure that only the fully surrounded 'O' cells are flipped to 'X'. The overall time and space complexities are optimal for this problem, making it suitable for large boards. This approach ensures that we correctly identify and handle all the regions without redundant operations, and it operates efficiently within the problem constraints.
