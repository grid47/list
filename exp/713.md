### Problem Statement
Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`, find the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all elements in the subarray is less than `k`.

### Approach
1. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Use two pointers (`i` and `j`) to represent the current subarray.
   - Iterate through the array with the outer pointer `i` while maintaining a running product of the elements.

2. **Product Calculation**:
   - Multiply the current number (`nums[i]`) into the product.
   - If the product becomes greater than or equal to `k`, increment the inner pointer `j` to reduce the product until it is less than `k`.

3. **Count Valid Subarrays**:
   - For each valid position of `i`, the number of valid subarrays that end at `i` is `(i - j + 1)`, since all subarrays starting from `j` to `i` are valid.

### Code Walk-through
- **Variables**:
  - `prod`: To keep track of the product of the current subarray.
  - `res`: To count the number of valid subarrays.
  - `j`: The starting index of the current subarray.

- **Function**:
  - `numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k)`: Computes the total number of contiguous subarrays with a product less than `k`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of `nums`. Each element is processed at most twice (once by `i` and once by `j`).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only a constant amount of extra space is used for variables.
