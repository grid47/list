### Problem Statement
Given two strings `a` and `b`, your task is to find the minimum number of times you need to repeat string `a` such that string `b` is a substring of the repeated version of `a`. If it is not possible, return -1.

### Approach
The approach involves checking for each possible starting position in `a` whether `b` can be formed by repeating `a`. The key steps in the algorithm are:

1. **Double the String**: While we will not actually create a repeated string, we can conceptually treat `a` as if it were repeated by allowing it to wrap around using the modulo operation.

2. **Nested Loop**: Use two nested loops:
   - The outer loop iterates over each character in `a`.
   - The inner loop checks if the characters of `b` match the characters of `a`, accounting for wrapping using modulo.

3. **Count Repetitions**: If a full match of `b` is found starting from a given index in `a`, calculate the number of times `a` needs to be repeated to form this match.

4. **Return the Result**: If no match is found after all possible starting positions, return -1.

### Code Walk-through
- The outer loop iterates through each character of `a`. For each starting character, the inner loop checks if the substring of `b` can be matched with the repeated characters of `a` using the modulo operator to handle wrapping.
- If a full match of `b` is found, the number of repetitions is calculated based on the index of the match in relation to the size of `a`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the length of `a` and `n` is the length of `b`. In the worst case, the algorithm checks all characters in `b` for every character in `a`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are not using any additional data structures that grow with input size.

This method efficiently checks for substring formation through repetition without generating large strings, making it suitable for the problem constraints.
