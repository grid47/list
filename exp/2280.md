### Problem Statement

In this problem, we are given a list of 2D points represented as pairs of coordinates, and our goal is to determine the minimum number of straight lines required to connect all the points. The key challenge is to minimize the number of lines by grouping points that lie on the same straight line.

A straight line is defined by two points, and if a third point lies on the same line, it will satisfy the equation of the line formed by the first two points. The problem requires finding the minimum number of such lines needed to connect all points.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimal number of straight lines that can connect all the given points, such that some points are collinear (lie on the same line). Here's how we can approach the problem:

1. **Sorting the Points**: First, we sort the points by their x-coordinates. Sorting helps us process the points in an orderly manner and helps ensure that we check for collinearity in a sequential manner.

2. **Checking for Collinearity**: The main task is to determine if three consecutive points lie on the same straight line. To check whether three points are collinear, we can calculate the slope between pairs of points. Instead of computing the slope directly (which could involve division and floating-point errors), we compare the cross-products of the differences in the y-coordinates and x-coordinates.

   - For three points \( (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) \), the points are collinear if:
   
     \[
     (y2 - y1) * (x3 - x2) = (y3 - y2) * (x2 - x1)
     \]
   
   If this condition holds, the three points are collinear and can be connected by the same line. If not, a new line is needed.

3. **Counting the Number of Lines**: We start by assuming that the first two points are connected by a line, so we set the initial number of lines to 1. Then, we iterate through the rest of the points, checking for collinearity with the previous two points. If a point is collinear with the previous two, it can be connected to the same line. If not, we increment the count of lines.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The algorithm also accounts for small inputs, such as when there are fewer than two points. In such cases, no lines are required, and the output is 0.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's break down the code to understand its functionality in detail:

#### Step 1: Sort the Points

```cpp
sort(stk.begin(), stk.end());
```

- First, we sort the points in increasing order based on their x-coordinates. Sorting helps to process points sequentially, making it easier to check for collinearity between consecutive points.
  
#### Step 2: Initialize Variables

```cpp
int res = 1, n = stk.size();
if (n < 2) return 0;
```

- We initialize `res` to 1, assuming that at least one line is required to connect the points.
- We check if the number of points is less than 2. If so, no lines are required (since a single point doesn’t need a line to connect it), so we return 0 immediately.

#### Step 3: Iterate Through Points to Check for Collinearity

```cpp
for(int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    long x1 = stk[i][0], x2 = stk[i - 1][0], x3 = stk[i - 2][0];
    long y1 = stk[i][1], y2 = stk[i - 1][1], y3 = stk[i - 2][1];
    
    long diff1 = (y3 - y2) * (x2 - x1);
    long diff2 = (y2 - y1) * (x3 - x2);
    
    if (diff1 != diff2) res++;
}
```

- We begin the loop from the third point (index 2) and iterate through the list of points.
- For each point, we calculate the cross-products to check if the current point and the previous two points are collinear.
  - `diff1` and `diff2` represent the cross-products of differences in y-coordinates and x-coordinates for the consecutive points. If `diff1` is equal to `diff2`, it means the points are collinear.
  - If the points are not collinear, we increment the count of lines `res`.

#### Step 4: Return the Result

```cpp
return res;
```

- After the loop, we return the total count of lines required to connect all points.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the Points**: Sorting the points takes **O(n log n)** time, where `n` is the number of points. This is because the sort operation uses an efficient sorting algorithm like QuickSort or MergeSort, which has a time complexity of **O(n log n)**.

2. **Checking for Collinearity**: The loop iterates through each point exactly once, and in each iteration, we perform constant time calculations to check for collinearity. Therefore, the time complexity for this step is **O(n)**.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is:
- **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step.

#### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is **O(1)** because we only use a few extra variables for calculations, and the input is sorted in-place. No extra space is used other than the input itself.

### Example Walkthrough

Let’s walk through an example to better understand how the solution works.

#### Example 1

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> points = {{1, 1}, {2, 2}, {3, 3}, {4, 5}, {5, 5}};
```

1. First, we sort the points by their x-coordinates:
   - After sorting, the points are: `{{1, 1}, {2, 2}, {3, 3}, {4, 5}, {5, 5}}`.

2. We initialize `res = 1` (assuming at least one line is required) and start checking for collinearity from the third point.

3. For the first set of points (`{1, 1}, {2, 2}, {3, 3}`), we calculate the cross-products:
   - `diff1 = (2 - 1) * (3 - 2) = 1`
   - `diff2 = (3 - 2) * (2 - 1) = 1`
   - Since `diff1 == diff2`, the points are collinear, and we don’t need to increment `res`.

4. For the next set of points (`{2, 2}, {3, 3}, {4, 5}`), we calculate the cross-products:
   - `diff1 = (3 - 2) * (4 - 3) = 1`
   - `diff2 = (4 - 3) * (3 - 2) = 1`
   - Since `diff1 != diff2`, the points are not collinear, so we increment `res` to 2.

5. For the last set of points (`{3, 3}, {4, 5}, {5, 5}`), we calculate the cross-products:
   - `diff1 = (5 - 5) * (4 - 5) = 0`
   - `diff2 = (5 - 3) * (5 - 4) = 2`
   - Since `diff1 != diff2`, the points are not collinear, so we increment `res` to 3.

6. The result is `res = 3`, meaning three lines are required to connect all the points.

#### Example 2

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> points = {{1, 1}, {2, 2}, {3, 3}};
```

1. Sorting the points gives: `{{1, 1}, {2, 2}, {3, 3}}`.

2. The first two points `{1, 1}` and `{2, 2}` are collinear with the third point `{3, 3}`, so only one line is needed.

3. The result is `res = 1`.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently calculates the minimum number of straight lines required to connect a set of points using sorting and collinearity checks. By leveraging the properties of collinearity and using cross-products to avoid floating-point arithmetic, it ensures that the solution is both accurate and efficient. With a time complexity of **O(n log n)**, this approach works well for large inputs.
