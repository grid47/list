### Problem Statement
Implement a function to solve the N-Queens puzzle. The objective is to place \( N \) queens on an \( N \times N \) chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be placed in the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Approach
1. **Backtracking**:
   - Use backtracking to explore all potential placements of queens on the board.
   - Start placing queens row by row.
   
2. **Base Case**:
   - If all \( N \) queens are placed (i.e., the current row index equals \( n \)), add the current board configuration to the result.

3. **Placement Check**:
   - For each position in the current row, check if placing a queen there is valid using the `canPlace` function.
   - If valid, place the queen and move to the next row recursively.
   - Backtrack by removing the queen after exploring the possibilities.

4. **Checking Valid Placement**:
   - Ensure no queen is placed in the same column, and check both diagonals for conflicts.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function `solveNQueens`**:
   - Initializes the board and starts the backtracking process.
- **Function `bt` (Backtracking)**:
   - Iterates over each column in the current row, checking for valid placements.
- **Function `canPlace`**:
   - Checks if a queen can be placed at position \((i, j)\) by checking:
     - The column for existing queens.
     - The upper-left diagonal for conflicts.
     - The upper-right diagonal for conflicts.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The worst-case scenario is \( O(N!) \), as we may need to explore all permutations of queen placements.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(N) \) for the recursion stack and board representation.
