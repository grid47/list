### Problem Statement

The problem requires us to find the number of arithmetic triplets in a given array `nums` such that for each triplet `(a, b, c)`:
- `b - a = diff`
- `c - b = diff`

Where `diff` is a given difference value. In other words, we need to find how many triplets of numbers in the array form an arithmetic progression with the given common difference `diff`.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize a **hash map** (or an array in this case, since the range of numbers is limited) to track the occurrences of potential values that could form the triplet. The idea is to iterate over the numbers in the array, and for each number, check if the required preceding and succeeding numbers of the triplet have already been encountered. If they have, we increment the count of valid triplets.

The algorithm works by:
1. Iterating over the array `nums`.
2. For each number `n` in the array, check if:
   - `n - diff` exists in the array (this is the first number in the triplet).
   - `n - 2*diff` exists in the array (this is the second number in the triplet).
3. If both conditions are met, we have found an arithmetic triplet and increment the result counter.
4. We maintain an array `cnt` to track the numbers we've encountered so far and ensure that we do not count the same number multiple times.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int arithmeticTriplets(vector<int>& nums, int diff) {
        int cnt[201] = {}, res = 0;
```
- **`cnt[201] = {}`**: We declare a frequency array `cnt` with a size of `201` to track the occurrence of numbers in `nums`. The array is initialized to zero. The reason we use a fixed array size is because the numbers in `nums` are guaranteed to be in the range `[0, 200]`, as per the problem constraints. So, we can safely use this array to track the numbers we encounter.
- **`res = 0`**: This variable keeps track of the number of valid arithmetic triplets we have found.

```cpp
        for (auto n : nums) {
            if (n >= 2 * diff)
                res += cnt[n - diff] && cnt[n - 2 * diff];
            cnt[n] = true;
        }
```
- **`for (auto n : nums)`**: We iterate through each number `n` in the array `nums`.
- **`if (n >= 2 * diff)`**: This condition checks if the current number `n` can potentially be the third number in an arithmetic triplet. The smallest possible value for `n` to be the third number in the triplet is `2 * diff`. If `n` is less than `2 * diff`, it's impossible for `n` to be the third number of a valid triplet because the second number would be negative or outside the valid range of the array.
  
  If `n >= 2 * diff`, we proceed to check for potential triplets.
  
- **`res += cnt[n - diff] && cnt[n - 2 * diff]`**: This line checks whether the previous two numbers in the triplet (i.e., `n - diff` and `n - 2 * diff`) have been encountered before in the array. If both of these values are present (i.e., `cnt[n - diff]` and `cnt[n - 2 * diff]` are both `true`), it means that we have found an arithmetic triplet `(n - 2*diff, n - diff, n)`. Therefore, we increment the result counter `res` by 1.
  
- **`cnt[n] = true`**: We mark the number `n` as encountered by setting `cnt[n]` to `true`. This ensures that future numbers can check if they can form a triplet with `n` as the second or third element.

```cpp
        return res;
    }
};
```
- **Return Statement**: Finally, we return the result `res`, which contains the total number of valid arithmetic triplets found in the array.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the algorithm is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we iterate over the array once, performing constant-time operations (array accesses and assignments) for each element.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)**, assuming that the size of the array `cnt` is constant (which it is, with size 201). Although we use an array to track numbers, its size does not depend on the input size `n`, making the space complexity constant.

### Conclusion

This solution is highly efficient for finding arithmetic triplets in an array with a time complexity of **O(n)** and a constant space complexity of **O(1)**. The algorithm works by maintaining a hash map (in this case, a simple frequency array `cnt`) to track the presence of numbers and checking the necessary conditions to form valid triplets. This method ensures that we can solve the problem with minimal time and space usage, making it suitable for large inputs.

- **Edge Cases Considered**:
  - Arrays with fewer than 3 elements (no triplet can be formed).
  - Arrays where no valid arithmetic triplets exist.
  - Arrays where all numbers are the same but don't form valid arithmetic progressions.
  
The solution leverages simple, efficient array operations to count valid arithmetic triplets, making it an ideal approach for solving this problem.
