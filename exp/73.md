### Problem Statement

The problem is to modify a given **m x n matrix** such that if any element in the matrix is `0`, its entire row and column are set to `0`. This operation must be done **in-place**, meaning you cannot use additional space for another matrix. The goal is to solve this problem with **O(1) additional space** (aside from the input matrix).

### Approach

To solve the problem efficiently, we need to use the **input matrix itself** to track which rows and columns need to be zeroed out. We can take advantage of the first row and first column of the matrix as markers to indicate which rows and columns contain zeros. This method ensures that we can modify the matrix without using extra space, other than a couple of flags for the first row and column.

#### Key Insights:
1. **Mark Rows and Columns Using First Row and First Column**:
   - Use the first row to mark which columns should be zeroed out.
   - Use the first column to mark which rows should be zeroed out.
   
2. **First Row and First Column Handling**:
   - Special attention is needed for the first row and first column because they are being used as markers. We must check if they themselves contain any zeros initially.

3. **In-place Zeroing**:
   - Once the markers are set in the first row and first column, we can iterate over the rest of the matrix to zero out the appropriate rows and columns.

4. **Restoring First Row and Column**:
   - After processing all other rows and columns, we will handle the first row and first column separately based on the flags set earlier.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize the Flags for First Row and Column
```cpp
int m = mtx.size(), n = mtx[0].size();
int zr = 0, zc = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    if(mtx[0][i] == 0) zr = 1;
for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    if(mtx[i][0] == 0) zc = 1;
```
- First, we initialize two variables `zr` and `zc` to track if the first row or first column contains any zeros.
- We loop over the first row to check if any element is `0`, and if so, we set the `zr` flag to `1`.
- Similarly, we loop over the first column to check if any element is `0`, and set the `zc` flag to `1`.

#### Step 2: Mark the Zeros in the Matrix Using First Row and First Column
```cpp
for(int i = 1; i < m; i++)
    for(int j = 1; j < n; j++)
        if(mtx[i][j] == 0) {
            mtx[i][0] = 0;
            mtx[0][j] = 0;
        }
```
- Now, we iterate over the matrix starting from the second row and second column.
- If any element `mtx[i][j]` is `0`, we set `mtx[i][0]` and `mtx[0][j]` to `0`. This marks the respective row and column to be zeroed.

#### Step 3: Zero Out the Rows and Columns Based on Markers
```cpp
for(int i = 1; i < m; i++)
    for(int j = 1; j < n; j++)
        if(mtx[i][0] == 0 || mtx[0][j] == 0)
            mtx[i][j] = 0;
```
- After marking the first row and first column, we iterate over the rest of the matrix.
- If the first column or the first row for any element `mtx[i][j]` is `0`, we set `mtx[i][j]` to `0`.

#### Step 4: Handle the First Row and First Column
```cpp
if(zr == 1)
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        mtx[0][i] = 0;
if(zc == 1)
    for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
        mtx[i][0] = 0;
```
- Finally, we handle the special case for the first row and first column.
- If the first row contains a zero (indicated by the `zr` flag), we set all elements in the first row to `0`.
- Similarly, if the first column contains a zero (indicated by the `zc` flag), we set all elements in the first column to `0`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**: We iterate over the matrix multiple times. In the worst case, we process each element of the matrix a constant number of times, resulting in a time complexity of O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The solution uses only a few integer variables (`zr`, `zc`) to track the state of the first row and first column. All modifications are made in-place, so no additional space is used.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently modifies the matrix in-place to set the entire row and column to zero if any element in the matrix is zero. By using the first row and column to store markers, the algorithm avoids using additional space, achieving **O(1) space complexity**. This approach ensures that the problem is solved efficiently in terms of both time and space.

This method is particularly useful for problems that require in-place transformations while maintaining optimal space usage. The use of the first row and first column as markers is a classic technique for reducing space complexity in matrix manipulation problems.
