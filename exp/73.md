### Problem Statement
Given a matrix `mtx`, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to `0`. Modify the matrix in place and do not use additional space for another matrix.

### Approach
1. **Identify Rows and Columns to Zero**:
   - Use the first row and the first column of the matrix to mark which rows and columns need to be set to zero.
   - Use two variables `zr` and `zc` to track if the first row or first column itself contains a zero.

2. **Mark Rows and Columns**:
   - Traverse the matrix starting from the second row and second column (i.e., `mtx[1][1]`).
   - If a cell contains `0`, set the corresponding cell in the first row and first column to `0`.

3. **Set Rows and Columns to Zero**:
   - Iterate through the matrix again, starting from the second row and column.
   - If the first cell of the row or the first cell of the column is `0`, set the cell to `0`.

4. **Zero out the First Row and Column**:
   - If `zr` is `1`, set the entire first row to `0`.
   - If `zc` is `1`, set the entire first column to `0`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix and set the `zr` and `zc` flags based on the first row and first column.
2. **Marking**:
   - For each zero found in the matrix (excluding the first row and column), mark the respective first row and first column.
3. **Applying Zeroes**: Use the marked positions to set the respective rows and columns to `0`.
4. **Final Adjustments**: If necessary, zero out the first row and/or first column based on the flags.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(M \times N) \), where \( M \) and \( N \) are the dimensions of the matrix.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \), since the solution modifies the matrix in place without using additional space.
