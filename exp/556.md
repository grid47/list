### Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `n`, find the next greater permutation of its digits. If no such permutation exists, return `-1`.

### Approach
1. **Convert to Digits**:
   - Convert the integer `n` into a string to easily access and manipulate its digits.

2. **Generate Next Permutation**:
   - Use the `next_permutation` function from the standard library to rearrange the digits into the next lexicographical order.

3. **Convert Back to Integer**:
   - Convert the resulting string back to a long long integer.

4. **Check for Validity**:
   - Ensure the resulting integer is greater than `n` and does not exceed `INT_MAX`. If either condition is not met, return `-1`.

### Code Walk-through
- The function `nextGreaterElement` takes an integer `n`.
- It converts `n` into a string, calls `next_permutation` to find the next greater arrangement of digits, and converts it back to an integer.
- Finally, it checks if the resulting integer is valid before returning it.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(d), where `d` is the number of digits in `n`, due to the next permutation operation.
- **Space Complexity**: O(d) for storing the digits in a string.
