### Problem Statement

Given a binary string `m`, we need to process multiple queries. Each query contains two integers, `a` and `b`, and the goal is to find the starting and ending indices of the substring in `m` that represents the binary number equal to `a XOR b`. If no such substring exists, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Approach

1. **Binary String Conversion**: Convert each number to binary to match substrings in the main string. By precomputing substrings in `m` that represent specific binary values, we can quickly answer each query.

2. **Mapping Substring Values**:
   - For each position in `m`, build substrings up to 32 bits (to avoid integer overflow in large numbers).
   - For each substring, calculate the integer value represented by its binary form. Use a map to store the integer value as a key and its starting and ending indices as the value.
   - This mapping (`mp`) allows us to directly retrieve the position of any target value by searching for the XOR result of each query in `mp`.

3. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query, calculate the XOR result (`a XOR b`). This result is the target integer that we need to find as a substring in `m`.
   - If the target exists in `mp`, use the mapped indices for the result. If not, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Helper Method: `str`

The `str` function converts an integer to a binary string representation.

1. **Initialize**:
   ```cpp
   string ans = "";
   ```
   The answer string is initialized as empty.

2. **Handle Edge Case of Zero**:
   ```cpp
   if(n == 0) return "0";
   ```
   If the input `n` is `0`, return `"0"` since the binary representation of zero is just `0`.

3. **Convert Number to Binary**:
   ```cpp
   while(n) {
       if(n & 1) {
           ans = "1" + ans;
       } else {
           ans = "0" + ans;
       }
       n >>= 1;
   }
   return ans;
   ```
   For each bit in `n`, prepend either `"1"` or `"0"` based on the current least significant bit. Right-shift `n` after each iteration until all bits are processed.

#### Helper Method: `substr`

The `substr` method manually finds a substring `s` in a string `m`.

1. **Edge Case Check**:
   ```cpp
   if(m.size() < s.size()) return vector<int>{-1, -1};
   ```
   If `m` is smaller than `s`, return `[-1, -1]` since `s` canâ€™t be a substring of `m`.

2. **Iterate to Find Matching Substring**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < m.size(); i++) {
       int j = 0;
       while(j < s.size() && i + j < m.size() && m[i + j] == s[j]) j++;
       if(j == s.size()) return vector<int>{i, i + j - 1};
   }
   return vector<int>{-1, -1};
   ```
   This loop attempts to match `s` to each possible substring starting from every position `i` in `m`. If `s` is found, it returns the start and end indices of the match.

#### Main Method: `substringXorQueries`

The `substringXorQueries` method handles the main logic of the problem.

1. **Initialize Map for Storing Substring Positions**:
   ```cpp
   map<int, vector<int>> mp;
   ```
   Use a map to store the binary values of all substrings in `m` as keys, with their starting and ending positions as values.

2. **Build Substring Integer Values**:
   ```cpp
   int k = m.size();
   for(int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
       if(m[j] == '0') {
           if(!mp.count(0)) mp[0] = {j, j};
           continue;
       }
       int num = 0;
       for(int i = j; i <= min(j + 31, k - 1); i++) {
           num = (num << 1) + (m[i] - '0');
           if(!mp.count(num)) mp[num] = {j, i};
       }
   }
   ```
   - Loop through each character in `m` starting from `j`.
   - If `m[j]` is `0`, map `0` to the position `[j, j]`.
   - For non-zero starting characters, form binary numbers of substrings up to 32 bits from position `j`. For each unique binary integer, map its indices in `mp`.

3. **Process Each Query**:
   ```cpp
   vector<vector<int>> ans(n, vector<int>{-1, -1});
   for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       int num = (q[i][0] ^ q[i][1]);
       if(mp.count(num)) ans[i] = mp[num];
   }
   return ans;
   ```
   For each query:
   - Calculate the XOR result (`a XOR b`) to get the target integer.
   - If `num` exists in `mp`, the mapped value gives the substring indices in `m`.
   - Store the result in `ans`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Mapping each substring takes \(O(k)\) for iterating through `m` and up to 32 iterations for each `j`. Thus, this portion is \(O(k)\).
  - Each query is processed in \(O(1)\) lookup time, resulting in \(O(n)\) for all queries.
  - Total time complexity is \(O(k + n)\).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The map `mp` uses \(O(k)\) space in the worst case for unique binary values.
  - `ans` uses \(O(n)\) space for storing query results.
  - Overall, the solution has a space complexity of \(O(k + n)\).

### Conclusion

This approach allows efficient handling of substring-based XOR queries by using a map to precompute binary representations for all potential substrings. The map enables quick lookups for each XOR result, providing a time-efficient solution.
