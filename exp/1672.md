### Problem Statement

The problem is to find the maximum wealth among a group of customers, where each customer has a specific amount of money distributed across different bank accounts. The wealth of a customer is defined as the sum of the money in all of their accounts. Given a 2D array, `accounts`, where each row represents a customer and each column represents the amount of money in a specific bank account, the goal is to determine which customer has the highest wealth.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we iterate through each customer's accounts, calculating the total wealth for each customer by summing the values in their corresponding row of the 2D array. We then compare each customer's total wealth to find the maximum value. The algorithm efficiently utilizes the `accumulate` function from the C++ Standard Library, which simplifies the summation of elements in each customer's account vector.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

The following is a breakdown of the code, explaining its functionality line by line:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumWealth(vector<vector<int>>& accounts) {
```

- **Class Definition**: We define a class named `Solution` that contains the method `maximumWealth`.
- **Method Signature**: The method takes a reference to a 2D vector of integers called `accounts`, which represents the wealth distribution among customers.

```cpp
        int richest = 0;
```

- **Variable Initialization**: We declare and initialize a variable `richest` to zero. This variable will keep track of the maximum wealth found during the iterations.

```cpp
        for (auto &customer : accounts)
```

- **Range-based for Loop**: We utilize a range-based for loop to iterate through each `customer` in the `accounts` vector. The `auto &` syntax ensures that we access each row of the accounts by reference, avoiding unnecessary copies.

```cpp
            richest = max (richest, accumulate(customer.begin(), customer.end(), 0));
```

- **Calculate Wealth**: For each `customer`, we use the `accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` header to compute the total wealth.
  - **`customer.begin()` and `customer.end()`**: These represent the beginning and end of the current customer's account vector.
  - **Sum Calculation**: The `accumulate` function computes the sum of all elements in the `customer` vector, starting from an initial value of `0`.
  - **Update Maximum Wealth**: We then compare this total wealth with the current maximum wealth stored in `richest`. If the current wealth is greater, we update `richest` with this new value.

```cpp
        return richest;
    }
};
```

- **Return Statement**: After iterating through all customers, we return the value of `richest`, which represents the maximum wealth found among all customers.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of customers (rows in `accounts`) and \(n\) is the average number of accounts per customer (columns in `accounts`). This is due to iterating through each customer and summing their account values.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) for this implementation, as we are using a constant amount of extra space to store the `richest` variable, regardless of the input size.

### Conclusion

The provided solution effectively computes the maximum wealth among customers using a straightforward approach. By leveraging the `accumulate` function, the code is concise and clear, demonstrating the efficiency of C++ STL functions in handling common tasks such as summation.

**Key Insights**:
1. **Efficiency**: The use of `accumulate` allows for clean and efficient summation of account values, reducing the need for manual loops.
2. **Clarity**: The range-based for loop improves readability by clearly indicating the traversal of the `accounts` data structure.
3. **Simplicity**: The problem is approached with simplicity, focusing on clear steps to achieve the desired outcome.

Overall, this solution highlights the importance of utilizing standard library functions to simplify code and enhance performance, making it an effective method for solving the maximum wealth problem.
