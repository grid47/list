### Problem Statement
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key. 

### Approach
1. **Reverse In-Order Traversal**:
   - Perform a reverse in-order traversal (right, root, left) of the BST to visit nodes in descending order.

2. **Maintaining a Running Sum**:
   - Use a variable (`sum`) to maintain the cumulative sum of node values encountered so far. When visiting each node, add the current node's value to `sum`, then update the node's value with this new sum.

3. **Updating Node Values**:
   - For each node visited, its value is updated to the cumulative sum, which effectively transforms the BST into a Greater Tree.

### Code Walk-through
- Initialize a `sum` variable to zero.
- The `convertBST` function initiates the conversion process.
- The `convert` function is recursively called to traverse the tree and update node values:
  - Traverse to the right child.
  - Update the current node's value and add it to `sum`.
  - Traverse to the left child.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, since each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack.
