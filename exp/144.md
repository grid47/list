### Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to return the **preorder traversal** of its nodes' values. Preorder traversal means that for each node in the tree, the algorithm visits the node first, then recursively visits the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.

For example:
- **Input**: `root = [1, null, 2, 3]`
- **Output**: `[1, 2, 3]`

In preorder traversal, you visit nodes in this order:
1. Visit the root node.
2. Traverse the left subtree.
3. Traverse the right subtree.

### Approach

The problem can be solved using **recursion** to implement the preorder traversal of a binary tree. We can visit each node and process it before moving on to its left and right children, following the definition of preorder traversal.

The recursive strategy for this task will involve:
1. **Base Case**: If the node is `NULL`, we return immediately (i.e., no further processing is needed).
2. **Recursive Case**: If the node is not `NULL`, we:
   - Process the current node (i.e., store its value).
   - Recursively call the preorder function for the left child.
   - Recursively call the preorder function for the right child.

This approach ensures we process the root node before recursively exploring the left and right subtrees.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Define the TreeNode Structure
```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};
```
The `TreeNode` structure is defined to represent each node of the binary tree. Each node contains:
- `val`: The value stored in the node.
- `left`: A pointer to the left child node.
- `right`: A pointer to the right child node.
  
#### Step 2: Define the Recursive Preorder Traversal Function
```cpp
void pre(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& ans) {
    if(!root) return;  // Base case: if the node is null, do nothing.
    ans.push_back(root->val);  // Visit the root node (process it).
    pre(root->left, ans);  // Recursively traverse the left subtree.
    pre(root->right, ans);  // Recursively traverse the right subtree.
}
```
- The `pre` function is defined to perform the preorder traversal. It takes the current node (`root`) and a vector (`ans`) to store the result.
- The function first checks if the current node is `NULL`. If it is, the function returns, terminating the recursion for that branch.
- If the node is not `NULL`, we add the value of the current node to the result vector `ans`.
- Then, the function recursively calls itself on the left child and the right child.

#### Step 3: Define the Preorder Traversal Wrapper Function
```cpp
vector<int> preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    vector<int> ans;  // Initialize an empty vector to store the result.
    pre(root, ans);  // Call the recursive preorder function.
    return ans;  // Return the result vector.
}
```
- The `preorderTraversal` function serves as the entry point. It initializes an empty vector `ans` to hold the values in preorder.
- It then calls the `pre` function to start the traversal from the root of the tree.
- Finally, it returns the vector `ans` containing the preorder traversal of the tree.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: In the worst case, we visit every node in the binary tree exactly once. The number of operations is proportional to the number of nodes in the tree, which is `n`.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The space complexity is determined by the space required to store the result vector `ans`, which has a size of `n` in the worst case. Additionally, the recursive calls on the call stack will use space, but the maximum depth of the recursion is equal to the height of the tree, which is `O(h)`. In the worst case, the tree is unbalanced, and the recursion depth is `O(n)`.

### Conclusion

This solution provides an efficient way to perform preorder traversal on a binary tree. By using recursion, we process the current node first, then recursively process the left and right subtrees, exactly as required by the preorder traversal. The approach is both straightforward and efficient, with a time complexity of **O(n)** and a space complexity of **O(n)**. This method is ideal for relatively small to medium-sized trees and guarantees that we traverse each node exactly once.

#### Key Points:
- The algorithm follows the definition of preorder traversal: visit the root, traverse the left subtree, then traverse the right subtree.
- **Recursive Solution**: The algorithm uses recursion to traverse the tree, making the code simple and easy to understand.
- **Linear Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, ensuring the algorithm runs efficiently.
- **Space Complexity Considerations**: The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the recursive call stack and the space used to store the result vector.

This approach can be modified to use an **iterative** method with a stack, but the recursive solution is elegant and easy to implement for this problem.
