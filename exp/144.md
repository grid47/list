### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, return the values of its nodes in preorder traversal (root, left, right).

### Approach
1. **Recursive Traversal**:
   - Use a recursive helper function to traverse the tree.
   - First, visit the root node, then recursively traverse the left subtree, followed by the right subtree.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1-7**: Define the `TreeNode` structure for a binary tree node.
- **Line 8**: Define the `Solution` class containing the traversal methods:
  - **Line 9-14**: Implement the `pre` function for recursive traversal:
    - Check if the current node (`root`) is null. If so, return.
    - Add the value of the current node to the result vector (`ans`).
    - Recursively call `pre` for the left and right children of the current node.
  - **Line 15-18**: Implement the `preorderTraversal` function:
    - Initialize an empty vector `ans` to store the traversal result.
    - Call the `pre` function with the root node to fill the `ans` vector.
    - Return the populated vector.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree, since each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(H)\), where \(H\) is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack in the worst case (unbalanced tree).
