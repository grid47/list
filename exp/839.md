### Problem Statement
You are given a list of strings. Two strings are considered similar if they can be made identical by swapping at most two characters. Your task is to determine how many groups of similar strings can be formed from the list.

### Approach
1. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - Implement a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to manage groups of similar strings.
   - Maintain a count of groups, initialized to the number of strings.

2. **Define Similarity**:
   - Create a function `similar` that checks if two strings differ by at most two characters. If they do, they are part of the same group.

3. **Iterate Through the Strings**:
   - Use a nested loop to compare each string with every other string. If two strings are similar, join their respective groups in the Union-Find structure.

4. **Count the Groups**:
   - The number of unique groups can be obtained from the Union-Find structure after processing all pairs.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2 * m), where n is the number of strings and m is the maximum length of the strings, due to the nested loop and character comparison.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the Union-Find structure.
