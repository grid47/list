### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, you need to find the maximum size of a set `S` such that you can start with any index `i`, follow the indices in `nums`, and eventually return to the starting index. The objective is to determine the length of the longest set formed in this manner.

### Approach
1. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - Use a loop to iterate over each index of the array `nums`.
   - For each index, initialize a counter to keep track of the size of the current set.

2. **Follow the Indices**:
   - Use a nested loop to follow the indices based on the values in `nums`.
   - Mark visited indices by setting their values to `-1` to avoid counting them again.

3. **Update Maximum Size**:
   - After processing each index, compare the size of the current set with the maximum size found so far and update it accordingly.

### Code Walk-through
- The function `arrayNesting` initializes a variable `mxsize` to store the maximum size of any set found.
- For each index, it follows the chain of indices while counting the size of the set formed and marking visited indices.
- The maximum size is returned at the end.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. Each element is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the modification of the original array is used to track visited elements, and no extra space proportional to input size is used.
