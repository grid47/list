### Problem Statement:
In this problem, we are given an array of integers `nums` and a positive integer `space`. The task is to find the smallest number in the array that can be divided by the largest frequency of remainders when divided by `space`. In other words, we want to find the number that, when divided by `space`, yields the most common remainder, and if there are multiple such numbers, we return the smallest one.

### Approach:
The approach involves two main steps:
1. **Finding the Most Frequent Remainder**:
   We need to find the remainder when each number in `nums` is divided by `space`. Using a hash map (unordered_map in C++), we count the occurrences of each remainder. The remainder with the highest frequency is our target remainder.
   
2. **Finding the Smallest Number with the Most Frequent Remainder**:
   After determining the most frequent remainder, we then iterate through the numbers in the array again. For each number, we calculate its remainder when divided by `space` and check if it matches the most frequent remainder. Among the numbers that match this remainder, we choose the smallest.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step):

Let’s break down the code into parts for better understanding:

1. **Function Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   int destroyTargets(vector<int>& nums, int space)
   ```
   This function `destroyTargets` takes two parameters:
   - `nums`: A vector of integers representing the array of numbers.
   - `space`: A positive integer used to calculate remainders.
   
   It returns an integer — the smallest number in `nums` that can be divided by the most frequent remainder.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int ans = INT_MAX;
   unordered_map<int, int> mp;
   int mx = INT_MIN;
   ```
   - `ans`: Initialized to `INT_MAX`, which will eventually store the smallest number that meets the criteria.
   - `mp`: An unordered map (`unordered_map<int, int>`) to store the frequency of each remainder when numbers are divided by `space`.
   - `mx`: Initialized to `INT_MIN`, which will keep track of the maximum frequency of any remainder.

3. **First Loop to Calculate Remainders and Their Frequencies**:
   ```cpp
   for(int n: nums) {
       int r = n % space;
       mp[r]++;
       if(mx < mp[r]) mx = mp[r];
   }
   ```
   This loop iterates through each number in the `nums` array:
   - For each number `n`, we calculate the remainder `r = n % space` — this gives the remainder when `n` is divided by `space`.
   - We then increment the count for this remainder in the map `mp[r]`.
   - If the frequency of this remainder exceeds the current maximum frequency (`mx`), we update `mx` to this new higher frequency.

   After this loop, the `mp` map contains the frequencies of all remainders, and `mx` contains the highest frequency.

4. **Second Loop to Find the Smallest Number with the Most Frequent Remainder**:
   ```cpp
   for(int n : nums)
       if(mx == mp[n %space]) ans = min(ans, n);
   ```
   This second loop iterates through the numbers in the `nums` array again:
   - For each number `n`, we calculate the remainder `n % space`.
   - If the frequency of this remainder matches the maximum frequency (`mx`), we update `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `n`. This ensures that `ans` holds the smallest number that has the most frequent remainder.

5. **Return the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return ans;
   ```
   Finally, the function returns `ans`, which holds the smallest number from `nums` that has the most frequent remainder when divided by `space`.

### Complexity:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the first loop is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the size of the `nums` array. This loop iterates through all the numbers to calculate the remainders and their frequencies.
   - The time complexity of the second loop is also \(O(N)\), as it iterates through the array again to find the smallest number with the most frequent remainder.
   
   Thus, the overall time complexity is:
   \[
   O(N)
   \]
   where \(N\) is the number of elements in `nums`.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is \(O(K)\), where \(K\) is the number of distinct remainders. In the worst case, the number of distinct remainders can be at most `space` (since remainders are values from 0 to `space-1`).
   
   Therefore, the space complexity is:
   \[
   O(S)
   \]
   where \(S\) is the value of `space`.

### Conclusion:
The `destroyTargets` function efficiently solves the problem by calculating the remainders of all the numbers when divided by `space` and counting their frequencies using a hash map. By tracking the maximum frequency of any remainder, the algorithm identifies the remainder that occurs most frequently. Then, by iterating through the `nums` array again, it finds the smallest number corresponding to the most frequent remainder.

The time complexity of the solution is linear with respect to the size of the input array, making it efficient for large inputs. The space complexity is dependent on the value of `space`, but it remains manageable for typical inputs. This solution is optimal for the problem and provides a clear, concise approach to finding the desired result.
