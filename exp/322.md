### Problem Statement

The problem is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given amount using a set of available coin denominations. You are given an array of integers `coins` representing different coin denominations, and an integer `amount` representing the total amount you need to form. Your task is to return the minimum number of coins needed to make the amount, or return `-1` if that amount cannot be formed using the given coin denominations.

This is a classical **dynamic programming** problem that can be solved using either **bottom-up** or **top-down** approaches. Here, we will be using the **top-down approach** (also known as memoization) to efficiently compute the solution.

### Approach

The problem can be approached using dynamic programming (DP) because it has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties. This means that we can break down the problem into smaller subproblems and store their solutions to avoid redundant calculations.

#### Key Insights:
1. **Recursive Structure**: To solve for a given amount, we consider whether we include a coin of a particular denomination or not. If we include it, the problem reduces to a smaller amount, and if we don't, we move on to the next coin.
2. **Memoization**: Since there are overlapping subproblems (i.e., the same amount can be recomputed multiple times), we use memoization to store the results of previously computed subproblems. This ensures that we do not recompute results for the same problem multiple times.
3. **Optimization by Sorting**: Sorting the coins in descending order is a potential optimization to prioritize larger coins first, though it's not strictly necessary for correctness.

#### Detailed Approach:
- **Recursive Relation**: For each coin at index `idx`, we have two options:
  1. **Use the coin**: If the remaining amount (`amnt`) is greater than or equal to the current coin value, we reduce the amount and count one more coin.
  2. **Skip the coin**: If we do not use the coin, we move to the next coin in the list.
  
- The goal is to minimize the number of coins required to reach the given amount.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Sorting the Coins
```cpp
sort(coins.begin(), coins.end(), cmp);
```
- The coins are sorted in descending order to prioritize larger coin denominations first. Sorting is optional, but it can potentially help to reach a solution faster when trying to minimize the number of coins (although it doesn't affect the correctness of the algorithm).

#### Step 2: Memoization Initialization
```cpp
memo.resize(coin.size(), vector<int>(amount + 1, -1));
```
- The `memo` table is initialized to store the results of subproblems. The table is a 2D array where `memo[idx][amnt]` stores the minimum number of coins required to form the amount `amnt` starting from the coin at index `idx`.
- The table is initialized with `-1`, which signifies that a particular subproblem hasn't been solved yet.

#### Step 3: Recursive DP Function (`dp`)
```cpp
int dp(int idx, int amnt) {
    if(idx == coin.size()) return amnt == 0 ? 0 : INT_MAX - 1;
    if(memo[idx][amnt] != -1) return memo[idx][amnt];
    
    int res;
    if(amnt >= coin[idx]) {
        int r1 = 1 + dp(idx, amnt - coin[idx]);            
        int r2 = dp(idx + 1, amnt);
        res = min(r1, r2);
    } else {
        res = dp(idx + 1, amnt);
    }

    return memo[idx][amnt] = res;
}
```
- **Base Case**: If we reach the end of the `coin` list (`idx == coin.size()`), we check if the remaining amount `amnt` is zero. If it is, the result is `0` (no coins needed). Otherwise, if `amnt > 0`, it is impossible to form the amount with the remaining coins, so we return a large value (`INT_MAX - 1`).
- **Memoization Check**: If the solution for `memo[idx][amnt]` is already computed (not `-1`), we return the cached result to avoid redundant computation.
- **Recursive Case**: For each coin at index `idx`, we try two possibilities:
  - **Use the coin**: If the current amount `amnt` is greater than or equal to `coin[idx]`, we recursively call `dp(idx, amnt - coin[idx])` to check how many coins are required to form the remaining amount.
  - **Skip the coin**: If we cannot use the coin, we move on to the next coin by calling `dp(idx + 1, amnt)`.
  - We return the minimum of these two results, which represents the optimal choice (the minimum number of coins required).

#### Step 4: Final Result
```cpp
int ans = dp(0, amount);
return ans == INT_MAX - 1 ? -1 : ans;
```
- The result of the `dp(0, amount)` function call gives the minimum number of coins required to form the amount starting from the first coin.
- If the result is `INT_MAX - 1` (i.e., the amount cannot be formed), we return `-1`. Otherwise, we return the number of coins required.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the number of coin denominations and `m` is the target amount.
  - The memoization table has `n * m` entries.
  - Each entry is filled once, and the computation for each entry is constant time (`O(1)`).
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n * m)`.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space complexity**: `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the number of coin denominations and `m` is the target amount.
  - The space complexity is dominated by the memoization table, which has `n * m` entries.

### Conclusion

The solution utilizes dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently solve the coin change problem. By recursively breaking down the problem and storing intermediate results, we avoid redundant calculations, significantly improving efficiency. The approach has a time complexity of `O(n * m)`, making it suitable for a wide range of inputs. The algorithm ensures that the minimum number of coins is found, or returns `-1` if it is not possible to form the given amount. This approach is optimal for solving this type of coin change problem.
