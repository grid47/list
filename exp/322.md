### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `coins` representing coin denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money, find the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

### Approach
This problem can be approached using dynamic programming with memoization. The steps are as follows:

1. **Sorting Coins**: Sort the `coins` array in descending order. This helps in exploring larger denominations first, which can potentially lead to fewer coins used.

2. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   - Define a recursive function `dp(idx, amnt)` where `idx` represents the current coin index being considered and `amnt` is the remaining amount to be made.
   - The base case checks if `idx` has reached the end of the `coins` array. If `amnt` is zero, return 0 (no more coins needed). If `amnt` is not zero, return `INT_MAX - 1` (indicating that this path is not valid).

3. **Memoization**: Use a 2D vector `memo` to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - If the current coin can be used (i.e., `amnt >= coin[idx]`), calculate the minimum coins needed by:
     - Taking the coin (`1 + dp(idx, amnt - coin[idx])`).
     - Not taking the coin (`dp(idx + 1, amnt)`).
   - If the current coin cannot be used, skip to the next coin (`dp(idx + 1, amnt)`).

5. **Return Result**: After exploring all options, if the result is still `INT_MAX - 1`, it means it is impossible to form the `amount` with the given coins, and return `-1`. Otherwise, return the number of coins.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A vector of integers `coins` and an integer `amount`.
- **Output**: An integer representing the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount.

1. Sort the `coins` array.
2. Initialize the memoization table.
3. Call the `dp` function starting from the first coin and the full amount.
4. Return the result based on the computed value.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \cdot m)\), where \(n\) is the number of coins and \(m\) is the amount. The memoization table has dimensions based on the number of coins and the amount.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n \cdot m)\) for the memoization table.
