### Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `nums` and `cost`, the task is to find the minimum cost to make all elements in `nums` equal, where the cost of changing any element `nums[i]` to a value `x` is given by the formula `abs(nums[i] - x) * cost[i]`. You need to determine the value of `x` that minimizes the total cost.

### Approach

The problem asks us to choose a value `x` and compute the total cost to transform all elements of `nums` to `x`. The cost is determined by the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `x`, multiplied by `cost[i]`. The goal is to find the value of `x` that minimizes this total cost.

To approach this problem, a **binary search** strategy is used to efficiently find the optimal value of `x` that minimizes the cost.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Cost Calculation**:
   The cost to make all elements equal to `x` is the sum of `abs(nums[i] - x) * cost[i]` for each element `i` in the array. The key idea is that this function is unimodal, meaning it decreases to a minimum point and then increases. This makes it well-suited for binary search.

2. **Binary Search for Minimum Cost**:
   - Since the cost function is unimodal, we can use binary search to efficiently find the `x` that minimizes the cost.
   - The binary search is performed over the range of values from the minimum element to the maximum element in the `nums` array.

3. **Function for Cost Calculation**:
   We define a helper function `fn(nums, cost, x)` that computes the total cost of transforming all elements of `nums` to `x`. This function iterates through the array `nums`, computes the cost for each element, and sums it up.

4. **Binary Search Process**:
   - We initialize the range for `x` as the minimum and maximum values in the `nums` array.
   - In each step of the binary search, we compute the cost for two middle values (`mid` and `mid + 1`), and select the smaller one to continue searching in the corresponding half of the range.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
long long fn(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& cost, int x) {
    long long res = 0;
    int n = nums.size();
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        res += (long long)abs(nums[i] - x) * cost[i];
    }
    return res;
}

long long minCost(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& cost) {
    // Step 1: Initialize left and right bounds for binary search
    int l = nums[0], r = nums[0];
    for(int x: nums) {
        l = min(x, l);  // Find the minimum value in nums
        r = max(x, r);  // Find the maximum value in nums
    }

    // Step 2: Compute the initial cost for making all elements equal to nums[0]
    long long ans = fn(nums, cost, nums[0]);
    
    // Step 3: Perform binary search to minimize the cost
    while(l <= r) {
        long long mid   = l + (r - l + 1) / 2;    // Compute the middle point
        long long y1    = fn(nums, cost, mid);     // Cost of making all elements equal to mid
        long long y2    = fn(nums, cost, mid + 1); // Cost of making all elements equal to mid + 1

        ans = min(y1, y2); // Update the minimum cost with the smaller of y1 and y2

        // Step 4: Adjust the search bounds based on the costs
        if(y1 < y2) {
            r = mid - 1;  // If y1 is smaller, we search the left half
        } else {
            l = mid + 1;  // If y2 is smaller or equal, we search the right half
        }
    }

    return ans;  // Return the minimum cost found
}
```

#### Step 1: Initialize left and right bounds for binary search
```cpp
int l = nums[0], r = nums[0];
for(int x: nums) {
    l = min(x, l);  // Find the minimum value in nums
    r = max(x, r);  // Find the maximum value in nums
}
```
- We begin by setting the initial search range for `x` as the minimum and maximum values in the `nums` array.
- These values represent the potential range for `x` since we are looking for a value in the range of `nums` that minimizes the cost.

#### Step 2: Compute the initial cost for making all elements equal to `nums[0]`
```cpp
long long ans = fn(nums, cost, nums[0]);
```
- The function `fn` is called with `x = nums[0]` to compute the initial cost of transforming all elements of `nums` to `nums[0]`.
- This serves as the starting point for the binary search process.

#### Step 3: Perform binary search to minimize the cost
```cpp
while(l <= r) {
    long long mid = l + (r - l + 1) / 2;
    long long y1 = fn(nums, cost, mid);
    long long y2 = fn(nums, cost, mid + 1);
    ans = min(y1, y2);
```
- In the binary search loop, we compute the middle point `mid` of the current range `[l, r]`. The value `mid` represents a candidate for the optimal `x`.
- We then compute the total cost for transforming all elements of `nums` to `mid` and `mid + 1` using the `fn` function.
- The minimum of these two costs is selected as the new answer `ans`.

#### Step 4: Adjust the search bounds based on the costs
```cpp
if(y1 < y2) {
    r = mid - 1;
} else {
    l = mid + 1;
}
```
- After comparing the costs, we adjust the bounds of the search:
  - If the cost for `mid` (`y1`) is smaller than the cost for `mid + 1` (`y2`), we narrow the search to the left half of the current range, setting `r = mid - 1`.
  - Otherwise, we narrow the search to the right half, setting `l = mid + 1`.

#### Final Step: Return the minimum cost
```cpp
return ans;
```
- Once the binary search completes, the variable `ans` holds the minimum cost to make all elements in `nums` equal, and this value is returned.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is **O(n log m)**, where:
- `n` is the size of the `nums` array (the number of elements),
- `m` is the range between the minimum and maximum values in `nums`.

1. **Binary Search**: The binary search operates over the range `[l, r]`, which takes **O(log m)** iterations.
2. **Cost Calculation**: For each middle value in the binary search, the cost calculation `fn` requires iterating through all `n` elements of the `nums` array, which takes **O(n)** time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log m)**.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the input arrays `nums` and `cost`, which are required to store the values for the calculations. The auxiliary space used by the algorithm is constant, **O(1)**.

### Conclusion

The solution uses binary search to efficiently find the value of `x` that minimizes the cost of transforming all elements in `nums` to `x`. By leveraging the unimodal nature of the cost function, we are able to reduce the complexity of the problem and find the optimal value of `x` in **O(n log m)** time, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums` and `m` is the range of values in `nums`. This approach ensures that we can solve the problem efficiently for large inputs.
