### Problem Statement
Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the k-th smallest integer in the range from 1 to n in lexicographical order.

### Approach
1. **Understanding Lexicographical Order**:
   - Lexicographical order is similar to dictionary order. For example, "10" comes before "2".

2. **Counting the Numbers**:
   - Define a helper function `getGap` that calculates the number of integers between a range `[a, b)` that are less than or equal to `n`.
   - The function keeps multiplying `a` and `b` by 10 to check how many complete sets of numbers can be formed (like `1`, `10`, `100`, etc.).

3. **Iterative Search**:
   - Start with the current number as `1` and iterate to find the k-th number:
     - Calculate the gap between `currNum` and `currNum + 1`.
     - If `i + gap` is less than or equal to `k`, increment `i` by `gap` and move to the next prefix (`currNum`).
     - If not, increment `i` and move to the next level by multiplying `currNum` by `10`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After `k` iterations, `currNum` will be the k-th smallest number in lexicographical order.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Lambda Function**:
   - `getGap` computes the number of integers starting with `a` and less than or equal to `n` using the concept of prefixes.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `k` numbers are counted, adjusting `currNum` based on the calculated gaps.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the function returns the value of `currNum`, which represents the k-th smallest number in lexicographical order.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), as each step reduces the range by a factor of 10.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space is used apart from a few variables.
