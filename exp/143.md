### Problem Statement

The problem requires you to reorder a singly linked list in a specific way: the first node should be followed by the last node, then the second node followed by the second last node, and so on. More formally, for a given linked list `L0 -> L1 -> L2 -> L3 -> ... -> Ln`, we want to reorder the list in the following pattern: 

`L0 -> Ln -> L1 -> Ln-1 -> L2 -> Ln-2 -> ...`.

### Example:
- **Input**: `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- **Output**: `head = [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`

- **Input**: `head = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- **Output**: `head = [1, 4, 2, 3]`

This problem requires manipulating a singly linked list in a way that the nodes are reordered in alternating positions, starting from both ends of the list.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to split the linked list into two halves, reverse the second half, and then merge the two halves in the desired alternating order.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Find the Middle of the List**: Use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle node of the list. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, and the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.

2. **Reverse the Second Half**: After finding the middle, the second half of the list starting from the `slow->next` node is reversed. This is done by iterating through the second half and reversing the `next` pointers.

3. **Merge the Two Halves**: After reversing the second half, merge the two halves alternately, starting with the first node of the first half, then the first node of the second half, and so on.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Finding the Middle of the Linked List
```cpp
ListNode* fast = head, *slow = head;
while(fast->next && fast->next->next) {
    slow = slow->next;
    fast = fast->next->next;
}
```
- We use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, initialized to the head of the list.
- The `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time, and the `slow` pointer moves one step at a time.
- The loop continues until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, at which point the `slow` pointer will be at the middle.

#### Step 2: Split the List and Reverse the Second Half
```cpp
ListNode* mid = slow->next;
slow->next = NULL;
ListNode* next, *prev = NULL;
while(mid) {
    next = mid->next;
    mid->next = prev;
    prev = mid;
    mid = next;
}
```
- After finding the middle, we split the list into two parts. The first part goes from `head` to `slow`, and the second part starts from `slow->next`.
- We set `slow->next` to `NULL` to disconnect the first half from the second half.
- Then, we reverse the second half of the list. We use a `prev` pointer to track the reversed list, and `mid` moves through the second half, reversing the links one by one.

#### Step 3: Merge the Two Halves
```cpp
ListNode* l1 = head, *l2 = prev;
while(l1 && l2) {
    ListNode* tmp1 = l1->next;
    l1->next = l2;
    ListNode* tmp2 = l2->next;
    l2->next = tmp1;
    l1 = tmp1;
    l2 = tmp2;
}
```
- Now we merge the two halves. We initialize two pointers, `l1` (pointing to the first half) and `l2` (pointing to the reversed second half).
- We alternate between nodes from `l1` and `l2` by updating the `next` pointers. Specifically, we first link `l1` to `l2`, then `l2` to the next node of `l1`, and so on.
- The `while` loop continues until both `l1` and `l2` become `NULL`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The algorithm performs three major operations:
  1. Finding the middle of the list: O(n) where `n` is the number of nodes in the list.
  2. Reversing the second half: O(n/2) which is essentially O(n).
  3. Merging the two halves: O(n).
  
  As all operations are linear, the overall time complexity is O(n).

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The algorithm uses a constant amount of space (apart from the input list), as we are only using a few pointers to traverse and manipulate the list.

### Conclusion

This solution effectively reorders a singly linked list in linear time using a constant amount of space. The main idea is to split the list into two halves, reverse the second half, and then merge the two halves alternately. This approach ensures that the problem is solved optimally in terms of both time and space complexity.

#### Key Points:
1. **Linear Time Complexity**: The algorithm efficiently processes the list in a single pass for each of the three main steps.
2. **Constant Space Complexity**: It uses a fixed number of pointers and does not require extra data structures.
3. **Optimal Solution**: This method is the most optimal approach to reorder the list, leveraging efficient list manipulations without needing to convert the list to other data structures like arrays or vectors.

This approach is useful when working with large linked lists, as it ensures minimal memory usage and quick execution.
