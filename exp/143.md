### Problem Statement
Given a singly linked list, reorder it such that the nodes are arranged in a specific order: the first node followed by the last node, followed by the second node, followed by the second last node, and so forth.

### Approach
1. **Find the Middle**:
   - Use the two-pointer technique (slow and fast pointers) to find the middle of the linked list.
   
2. **Reverse the Second Half**:
   - Reverse the second half of the linked list starting from the middle node.

3. **Merge Two Halves**:
   - Merge the first half and the reversed second half of the linked list.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1-7**: Define the `ListNode` structure for the linked list.
- **Line 8**: Define the `reorderList` function:
  - **Line 9-12**: Initialize `fast` and `slow` pointers to find the middle of the list:
    - Move `fast` two steps and `slow` one step until `fast` reaches the end.
  - **Line 13**: Set `mid` to the node after `slow` and disconnect the first half from the second.
  - **Line 14-18**: Reverse the second half of the list:
    - Use `prev` to track the previous node while iterating through `mid`.
  - **Line 19-27**: Merge the two halves:
    - Use pointers `l1` (for the first half) and `l2` (for the reversed second half) to alternate between nodes and reconstruct the list.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the linked list, since each node is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as the reordering is done in place without using any additional data structures.
