### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `target`, and your goal is to determine the minimum number of moves required to reach that target from position `0`. In each move, you can either move one step forward or one step backward.

### Approach
1. **Target Adjustment**:
   - Since the movement is symmetric around `0`, convert `target` to its absolute value.

2. **Calculate Steps**:
   - Use the formula derived from the arithmetic series to find the minimum number of steps `n` such that the sum of the first `n` integers is at least `target`. This is given by the formula:
     \[
     n = \lceil \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 8 \cdot target}}{2} \rceil
     \]
   - Compute the sum of the first `n` integers: 
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n \cdot (n + 1)}{2}
     \]

3. **Check Conditions**:
   - If the sum equals the target, return `n` since it requires exactly `n` moves.
   - Calculate the difference `res` between `sum` and `target`.
   - If `res` is even, return `n` (no extra moves needed).
   - If `res` is odd, return `n + 1` or `n + 2` based on whether `n` is odd or even to ensure the parity matches.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to compute the minimum moves.

- **Method**:
  - `int reachNumber(int target)`: Implements the logic to determine the minimum number of moves required to reach the target position.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) since it involves constant-time mathematical operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as no additional space is used beyond a few variables.
