### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum value in each sliding window of size `k`.

### Approach
This solution utilizes a deque to maintain indices of elements in the current sliding window, ensuring that the front of the deque always holds the index of the maximum element within the window.

1. **Deque Maintenance**:
   - Remove elements from the front of the deque if they are outside the current window of size `k`.
   - Remove elements from the back of the deque while the current element is greater than or equal to the element at the deque’s back (to maintain decreasing order).

2. **Window Maximum**:
   - After processing the first `k` elements, add the maximum for each window to the result by taking the element at the deque's front.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: Vector `nums` and integer `k` (size of sliding window).
- **Output**: Vector `ret` where each element is the maximum of a sliding window of size `k`.

1. Iterate through each element in `nums` with index `i`.
   - Remove the front element if it’s outside the window (`i - k`).
   - Maintain decreasing order by popping from the back if the current element is greater.
   - Add the current index `i` to the back of the deque.
2. Once the first `k` elements are processed (`i >= k - 1`), add `nums[dq.front()]` (max in the current window) to `ret`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`, since each element is added and removed from the deque at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(k)\) for the deque, which stores indices within the sliding window.

### Edge Cases
1. **Small Array or Window Size**: If `nums` size is less than `k`, adjust to return empty or partial window results.
2. **All Elements Same**: Handles duplicates efficiently since it only retains necessary indices.
