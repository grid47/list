### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to maximize the sum of the largest elements in the array `nums` after performing `k` operations. Each operation allows you to take the largest element from the array, add it to the result, and replace it with a value that is one-third of its current value (rounded up). You need to repeat this process `k` times, and at the end, you should return the total sum.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to repeatedly access and modify the largest element of the array. The best way to handle this in an efficient manner is by using a max heap (priority queue). The steps can be broken down as follows:

1. **Initialize a Max Heap**: A max heap allows us to efficiently access the largest element in constant time. In C++, a `priority_queue` provides this functionality.

2. **Iterate for `k` Steps**: For each iteration (up to `k` times), we:
   - Extract the maximum element from the heap.
   - Add this element to the running total sum.
   - Replace the maximum element with one-third of its value (rounded up).
   - Push the modified value back into the heap.

3. **Return the Result**: After `k` operations, return the accumulated sum.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. Initializing the Max Heap

```cpp
priority_queue<int> pq;
```

- We declare a priority queue `pq` to represent a max heap. In a max heap, the largest element is always at the top, making it easy to access and modify.
  
#### 2. Push All Elements into the Max Heap

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
    pq.push(nums[i]);
}
```

- We iterate over all elements of the input array `nums` and push each element into the max heap `pq`. This allows us to access the largest element efficiently during each operation.

#### 3. Initialize the Running Total (`ans`)

```cpp
long long ans = 0;
```

- We initialize a variable `ans` to 0. This will be used to accumulate the sum of the largest elements chosen during the `k` operations.

#### 4. Perform `k` Operations

```cpp
while(k--) {
    int tmp = pq.top();
    cout << tmp << " ";
    ans += tmp;
    pq.pop();
    pq.push(ceil(tmp / 3.0));
}
```

- We enter a `while` loop that runs `k` times. In each iteration:
  
  1. **Access the Largest Element**: We use `pq.top()` to get the largest element of the heap (i.e., the element at the top of the heap).
  
  2. **Add to the Total**: We add the value of this largest element (`tmp`) to the total sum `ans`.
  
  3. **Remove the Element from the Heap**: We use `pq.pop()` to remove the largest element from the heap.
  
  4. **Modify and Reinsert the Element**: We calculate the new value of the element by dividing it by 3 and rounding up using `ceil(tmp / 3.0)`. We then push this new value back into the heap using `pq.push()`.

  5. This process ensures that the largest element is always selected, added to the sum, and replaced with a smaller value for the next iteration.

#### 5. Return the Result

```cpp
return ans;
```

- After performing `k` operations, we return the accumulated sum `ans`.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity is primarily determined by the operations on the priority queue:
- **Inserting into the heap**: Each insertion operation takes \( O(\log n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the heap.
- **Removing from the heap**: Similarly, each `pop` operation takes \( O(\log n) \).
- Since we perform `k` operations and each operation involves both a `pop` and a `push`, the overall time complexity is:
  
  \[
  O(k \cdot \log n)
  \]
  
  Where:
  - \( k \) is the number of operations.
  - \( n \) is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity is determined by the space required to store the heap:
- The heap stores all the elements of the array, which takes \( O(n) \) space.
  
Thus, the space complexity is:
  
  \[
  O(n)
  \]

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the maximum sum achievable by performing `k` operations on the array. Using a max heap ensures that we can always access and modify the largest element in logarithmic time. The overall time complexity of \( O(k \cdot \log n) \) makes this approach suitable for large input sizes, and the space complexity of \( O(n) \) is manageable.

This approach works well because:
- The max heap allows for efficient retrieval and modification of the largest element.
- By performing the operation `k` times, we ensure the sum is maximized by selecting the largest available elements during each step.
  
The solution is optimal in both time and space, making it a robust approach to solving the problem.
