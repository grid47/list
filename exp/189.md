### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps. The rotation is performed in-place, meaning you must modify the input array directly without using extra space.

### Approach
1. **Understanding Rotations**:
   - Rotating the array by `k` steps to the right can be achieved by reversing parts of the array.

2. **Reversal Technique**:
   - First, reverse the entire array.
   - Then, reverse the first `k` elements.
   - Finally, reverse the remaining elements from index `k` to the end of the array.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Calculate the effective number of rotations with `k = k % nums.size()` to handle cases where `k` is greater than the size of the array.
   - Call the `rev` function three times to perform the necessary reversals.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the class `Solution`.
- **Line 2**: Define the `rotate` function, which takes the array `nums` and the integer `k`.
- **Line 3**: Calculate the effective rotation count.
- **Line 4**: Reverse the entire array.
- **Line 5**: Reverse the first `k` elements.
- **Line 6**: Reverse the remaining elements.
- **Line 8**: Define the helper function `rev` to reverse elements in the specified range.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array. Each element is reversed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as the reversal is done in-place and does not require additional space.
