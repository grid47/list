### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to determine the first day on which a person has visited all rooms in a circular structure where each room points to the next room they will visit. Given an array `nxt` where `nxt[i]` indicates the room that can be accessed from room `i`, the goal is to compute the total number of steps taken until all rooms have been visited. The steps must be calculated modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Approach

To solve this problem, we will use a dynamic programming approach. The main idea is to keep track of the number of steps needed to reach each room while ensuring we efficiently calculate the contributions of previous rooms in our calculations.

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We will use a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the number of steps required to visit all rooms from room 0 to room `i`. The size of this array will be equal to the number of rooms, `n`.

2. **Transition Formula**: The main transition relies on the previous room's value in the DP array. For each room `i`:
   - The steps to reach room `i` can be derived from room `i-1`, which includes the previously calculated steps to reach `i-1`, plus additional steps needed to visit room `i`. The formula to compute `dp[i]` can be expressed as:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 1 + (dp[i - 1] - dp[nxt[i - 1]]) + 1 + \text{mod}) \mod \text{mod}
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the steps taken to get to the current room and adjusts for any backtracking to previously visited rooms.

3. **Final Result**: The answer will be the value of `dp[n - 1]`, which represents the total number of steps taken to visit all rooms.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let’s break down the provided code for a better understanding:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int n; // Number of rooms
    
    int firstDayBeenInAllRooms(vector<int>& nxt) {
        n = nxt.size(); // Get the size of the nxt array
        int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7; // Define the modulo value
        vector<long long> dp(n, 0); // Create a DP array initialized to 0
```
- The class `Solution` is defined, which contains a method `firstDayBeenInAllRooms`.
- We define `n` to hold the number of rooms.
- We initialize a vector `dp` of size `n`, where each element is initialized to `0` to store the number of steps for each room.
- The modulo value is set to \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure we don't encounter integer overflow.

```cpp
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 1 + (dp[i - 1] - dp[nxt[i - 1]]) + 1 + mod) % mod;
```
- The loop iterates over each room starting from `1` to `n - 1`. For each room `i`, we compute the number of steps required to reach it using the defined formula:
  - `dp[i - 1]`: Represents the total steps taken to reach the previous room.
  - `+ 1`: Accounts for the step taken to move from room `i-1` to room `i`.
  - `+ (dp[i - 1] - dp[nxt[i - 1]])`: Adjusts for any backtracking, ensuring we only count the necessary steps.
  - `+ 1`: Adds an additional step for the transition.
  - `mod`: Ensures that we stay within the bounds of the modulo.

```cpp
        return dp[n - 1]; // Return the total steps to visit all rooms
    }
};
```
- Finally, the function returns `dp[n - 1]`, which is the total number of steps taken to visit all rooms.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\) since we iterate through the `nxt` array once, performing constant-time calculations for each room.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the storage of the DP array that holds the number of steps for each room.

### Conclusion

The provided solution efficiently calculates the number of steps taken to visit all rooms using dynamic programming. By leveraging the properties of the problem and maintaining a DP array, the solution avoids unnecessary computations and achieves the desired result in linear time.

This algorithm is optimal for scenarios where you need to analyze paths in a structured way, especially in problems involving transitions between states or rooms. The modular arithmetic ensures that we handle large numbers gracefully, making this approach robust and suitable for competitive programming or algorithmic challenges.

### Example Usage

Here’s how you might utilize the `Solution` class to find the first day on which all rooms are visited:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nxt = {1, 2, 3, 4, 0}; // Example input
    int result = sol.firstDayBeenInAllRooms(nxt);
    cout << "First day been in all rooms: " << result << endl; // Should print the total steps
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `Solution` class, define the `nxt` vector representing the rooms' transitions, and call the `firstDayBeenInAllRooms` method to get the result.
