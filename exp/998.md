### Problem Statement
You are given the root of a maximum binary tree and an integer `val`. A maximum binary tree is defined as follows:
1. The root is the maximum value in the tree.
2. The left subtree is a maximum binary tree containing only values less than the root's value.
3. The right subtree is a maximum binary tree containing only values greater than the root's value.

The task is to insert a new value `val` into the maximum binary tree and return the root of the modified tree.

### Approach
1. **Recursive Insertion**:
   - If the current `root` is not `NULL` and the value of `root` is greater than `val`, then the new value should be inserted into the right subtree.
   - If the `root` is `NULL` or its value is less than or equal to `val`, create a new node with `val` and make this node the new root. The existing tree (root) becomes the left child of this new node.

### Code Walk-through
- The function `insertIntoMaxTree` takes the current `root` and the value to be inserted (`val`).
- It checks if the current `root` is valid and whether its value is greater than `val`.
- If so, it recursively inserts the value into the right subtree.
- If not, it creates a new node for `val`, sets its left child to the current `root`, and returns this new node as the new root.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(h), where `h` is the height of the tree. In the worst case, the function may traverse the height of the tree.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h) for the recursion stack in the worst case, where `h` is the height of the tree.
