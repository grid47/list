### Problem Statement
You are given `k` projects to choose from, each project has a capital requirement and a profit. Your goal is to maximize your capital after selecting `k` projects, starting with an initial capital `w`. You can only choose projects that require capital less than or equal to your current capital.

### Approach
1. **Data Structure Preparation**:
   - Use a vector of pairs to store the capital and profit of projects that require more capital than the initial amount.
   - Use a max-heap (priority queue) to store profits of projects that can be completed with the current capital.

2. **Initial Population**:
   - Loop through all projects. If the project's capital requirement is less than or equal to the initial capital `w`, add its profit to the max-heap.

3. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the projects that need more capital by their capital requirement to facilitate adding projects to the max-heap in the correct order later.

4. **Selecting Projects**:
   - For `k` iterations, do the following:
     - If the max-heap is not empty, pop the top profit (the highest profit available).
     - Increase the current capital by the profit obtained from the project.
     - While there are projects in the sorted list that can now be afforded, add their profits to the max-heap.

5. **Return Result**:
   - After selecting `k` projects, return the final capital.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Class Definition**:
   - The `Solution` class contains the method `findMaximizedCapital`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `arr` holds projects needing more capital, while `pq` is a max-heap for profits. `n` stores the number of projects.

3. **Main Method**:
   - `findMaximizedCapital` iterates through projects to fill the max-heap and sorted array.

4. **Project Selection Loop**:
   - In the main loop, profit is added to the capital, and further projects are pushed into the heap if their capital requirements are met.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of projects due to sorting and heap operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing projects in the array and max-heap.
