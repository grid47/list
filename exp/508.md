### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, find all subtree sums that occur most frequently. A subtree sum is the sum of all node values in a subtree, including the node itself.

### Approach
1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a map to count the frequency of each subtree sum.
   - Use a vector to store the most frequent sums.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Implement a DFS function to calculate the sum of each subtree.
   - For each node, calculate its subtree sum by adding the values of its left and right subtrees along with its own value.
   - Record the frequency of each sum in the map.

3. **Tracking Maximum Frequency**:
   - Maintain a variable to track the maximum frequency of any subtree sum encountered.
   - Update the result vector with subtree sums that have the maximum frequency.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After traversing the entire tree, return the vector of sums that occur most frequently.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Class Definition**:
   - The `Solution` class contains the method `findFrequentTreeSum`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `mx` stores the maximum frequency of subtree sums.
   - `mp` is a map to count occurrences of each subtree sum.
   - `ans` is a vector to store the sums with the highest frequency.

3. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function recursively computes subtree sums.
   - It updates the map with the frequency of each computed sum.

4. **Result Compilation**:
   - The function checks and updates the result vector based on the frequency of each sum.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case for the map and call stack in the DFS.
