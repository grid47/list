### Problem Statement
Convert an integer to its corresponding Roman numeral representation.

### Approach
Use a greedy algorithm to subtract the largest possible Roman numeral values from the integer, appending the corresponding symbols to the result string.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create two vectors: `nums` for the integer values of Roman numerals and `chrs` for their corresponding symbols.
   - Initialize an index `idx` to track the current position in the `nums` and `chrs` arrays.
   - Initialize an empty string `res` to build the resulting Roman numeral.

2. **While Loop**:
   - Continue processing until `num` is greater than 0:
     - Use a nested while loop to repeatedly subtract the current Roman numeral value (`nums[idx]`) from `num` as long as `num` is greater than or equal to that value.
     - Append the corresponding Roman numeral symbol (`chrs[idx]`) to `res` each time a subtraction occurs.
   - Increment `idx` to move to the next Roman numeral value.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Once `num` has been reduced to 0, return the constructed Roman numeral string `res`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) - where \(n\) is the number of different Roman numeral symbols (constant time as there are only 13 symbols).
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) - no additional space is used that scales with input size; only a few variables and strings are used.
