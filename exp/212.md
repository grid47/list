### Problem Statement
You need to find all words from a given list that can be formed by sequentially adjacent letters on a 2D board. The same letter cell can be used more than once in a word. Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring.

### Approach
1. **Trie Structure**: Use a trie to store the words for efficient searching.
   - Each node in the trie represents a character in a word and has:
     - A `val` for the character.
     - A `bool isWord` to indicate if the node marks the end of a valid word.
     - A `word` string to store the complete word when reached.
     - A `next` vector to represent children nodes.

2. **Building the Trie**:
   - Iterate through the list of words and insert each word into the trie character by character.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Traverse each cell in the grid, starting a DFS whenever an unvisited cell is reached.
   - During DFS:
     - Mark the cell as visited by changing its value to a placeholder (e.g., `'#'`).
     - Check if the current character leads to a valid word in the trie. If it does, store the word and mark it as found to prevent duplicates.
     - Explore all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
     - Backtrack by resetting the cell to its original value after exploring.

### Code Walk-through
- **Node Class**:
  - Represents a single character in the trie with attributes for the character value, a boolean flag indicating if it's a complete word, the word itself, and a vector for its children.

- **Solution Class**:
  - **findWords**: Initializes the board and constructs the trie from the provided words. It iterates through each cell to start the DFS.
  - **dfs**: The recursive function that explores the grid and searches for words in the trie:
    - Checks if the current cell is valid and if it corresponds to a character in the trie.
    - If a valid word is found, it adds it to the results.
    - Marks the cell as visited and explores its neighbors.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Constructing the trie: \(O(k \cdot m)\), where \(k\) is the number of words and \(m\) is the average length of the words.
  - DFS traversal: In the worst case, visiting all cells leads to \(O(N \cdot M)\) operations, where \(N\) and \(M\) are the dimensions of the board.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - \(O(k \cdot m)\) for the trie structure, and \(O(N \cdot M)\) for the grid if we consider the visited states.
