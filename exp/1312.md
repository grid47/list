### Problem Statement
Given a string `str`, determine the minimum number of insertions required to make it a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. The task is to find the smallest number of characters we can add to make the string symmetric.

### Approach
To solve this problem, we use a **Dynamic Programming (DP)** approach with memoization. The idea is to recursively find the minimum insertions needed by checking if characters at both ends of a substring are equal and adjusting accordingly:

1. **Define Recursive State**:
   - Let `dp(i, j)` represent the minimum insertions needed to make the substring `s[i]` to `s[j]` a palindrome.

2. **Recursive Transition**:
   - If `i == j`, the substring has only one character, so it’s already a palindrome, and no insertions are needed.
   - If `i == j - 1`, meaning the substring has two characters, check if they’re equal. If they are, no insertion is required (`dp(i, j) = 0`), otherwise, one insertion is needed (`dp(i, j) = 1`).
   - For larger substrings, if `s[i] == s[j]`, then no insertions are needed for these two characters. So, the problem reduces to `dp(i + 1, j - 1)`.
   - If `s[i] != s[j]`, one insertion is needed to make the ends match. We can choose either:
     - Insert a character to match `s[i]`, reducing the problem to `dp(i + 1, j)`.
     - Insert a character to match `s[j]`, reducing the problem to `dp(i, j - 1)`.
   - Take the minimum of these two options and add one to account for the insertion.

3. **Memoization**:
   - We use a 2D memoization table `memo[i][j]` to store results of subproblems, reducing redundant calculations.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The function `minInsertions(str)` initiates the recursive DP from the full string, `dp(0, str.size() - 1)`, to calculate the minimum insertions for the entire string.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Define Class Variables and Memoization Table**:
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `memo` is a 2D vector initialized to `-1` to store the results of subproblems.

   ```cpp
   string s;
   vector<vector<int>> memo;
   ```

2. **Recursive Function `dp(i, j)`**:
   - If `i == j`, return 0 (no insertion needed).
   - If `i == j - 1`, return `0` if `s[i] == s[j]`; otherwise, return 1.
   - If `s[i] == s[j]`, the result is `dp(i + 1, j - 1)`.
   - Otherwise, store and return `1 + min(dp(i + 1, j), dp(i, j - 1))`.

   ```cpp
   int dp(int i, int j) {
       if(i == j) return 0;
       if(i == j - 1) return s[i] == s[j]? 0: 1;
       
       if(memo[i][j] != -1) return memo[i][j];
       
       if(s[i] == s[j]) {
           return memo[i][j] = dp(i + 1, j - 1);
       }
       return memo[i][j] = 1 + min(dp(i + 1, j), dp(i, j - 1)); 
   }
   ```

3. **`minInsertions(str)` Function**:
   - Initialize `s` with `str` and resize `memo` based on the length of `s`.
   - Call `dp(0, s.size() - 1)` to start the calculation.

   ```cpp
   int minInsertions(string str) {
       s = str;
       memo.resize(s.size(), vector<int>(s.size(), -1));
       return dp(0, s.size() - 1);
   }
   ```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\)
  - Each subproblem is solved only once and stored in the memoization table.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\)
  - The space is required for the 2D `memo` table to store subproblem results.

### Conclusion
This solution efficiently determines the minimum number of insertions needed to make a string a palindrome by using a DP approach with memoization. The recursive function `dp(i, j)` optimally solves subproblems by checking characters at both ends and breaking the problem down further, making it suitable for long strings. This approach leverages memoization to improve efficiency, making it ideal for scenarios where minimizing modifications is crucial, such as text processing or sequence analysis.
