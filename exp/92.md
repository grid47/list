### Problem Statement
Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right`, reverse the nodes between positions `left` and `right`, inclusive, and return the modified list. The problem requires an in-place reversal of a specific sublist without affecting other nodes.

### Approach
1. **Create a Dummy Node**: Use a dummy node to simplify edge cases (e.g., reversing from the head).
2. **Identify Nodes**:
   - Traverse to `left-1`-th position and store the node as `pre`.
   - `start` is the node at the `left` position, marking the beginning of the section to reverse.
   - `then` is the node immediately following `start`.
3. **Reverse Sublist**:
   - For each position from `left` to `right`, adjust the pointers to reverse nodes in the target range.
   - Update pointers in each iteration to "insert" `then` after `pre` and adjust `start`'s `next` pointer.
4. **Return Result**: After reversing the required sublist, `dummy->next` will point to the head of the modified list.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Dummy Node Initialization**: Create a dummy node pointing to the head to handle edge cases smoothly.
2. **Positioning**: Traverse to `left-1` and set `pre`.
3. **Reversal Loop**:
   - For each position in the range `[left, right]`, adjust pointers to reverse the order.
   - Move `then` to the next node after each insertion.
4. **Return Modified List**: Return `dummy->next` as the head of the modified list.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the linked list, as we iterate through the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), for in-place modification of the list.
