### Problem Statement
You are given a list of `rooms`, where `rooms[i]` contains a list of keys that you can use to access other rooms. Initially, you are in room `0`, and your goal is to determine if you can visit all rooms.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a `vector<bool>` called `vis` to track which rooms have been visited. Mark room `0` as visited since you start there.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Implement a DFS function that takes the rooms, the visited list, and the current room as parameters.
   - Mark the current room as visited and explore each key in that room to access other rooms.

3. **Check All Rooms**:
   - After performing DFS, iterate through the `vis` vector to check if all rooms have been visited. If any room is not visited, return `false`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - If all rooms are visited, return `true`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the total number of rooms, as each room and each key is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for the visited list and the recursion stack.
