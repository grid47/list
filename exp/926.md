### Problem Statement
Given a binary string `s`, determine the minimum number of flips (changing '0' to '1' or '1' to '0') required to make the string monotonically increasing. A string is considered monotonically increasing if all '0's come before all '1's.

### Approach
1. **Count Tracking**:
   - Use two counters: `cnt_one` to count the number of '1's encountered and `cnt_flip` to count the flips needed to maintain a monotonic structure.

2. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', increment `cnt_one`.
     - If the character is '0', increment `cnt_flip`.
     - After processing each character, update `cnt_flip` to be the minimum of `cnt_one` and `cnt_flip`. This reflects the idea that for every '0' encountered, we could either flip it to '1' or consider it as a potential break in the monotonic sequence.

3. **Final Count**:
   - At the end of the iteration, `cnt_flip` will represent the minimum flips required to make the string monotonic.

### Code Walk-through
- Initialize `cnt_one` and `cnt_flip` to zero.
- Iterate through each character in the string `s`:
  - Update the counters based on the character.
  - Ensure `cnt_flip` always holds the minimum flips required.
- Return `cnt_flip` as the result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we traverse it once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space for counters.
