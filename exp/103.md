### Problem Statement
1. **Level Order Traversal**: Given a binary tree, return the level-order traversal of its nodes' values.
2. **Zigzag Level Order Traversal**: Extend the traversal to alternate the order of levels in a zigzag manner (left-to-right for one level, right-to-left for the next).

### Approach
1. **Level Order Traversal**:
   - Use a queue to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal on the tree.
   - For each level, collect nodes' values in a temporary list, `tmp`, and enqueue children for the next level.
   - Append `tmp` to the final answer list and clear it for the next level.
2. **Zigzag Level Order**:
   - First, obtain the level order traversal.
   - Iterate over the result and reverse the values for every other level (i.e., odd-indexed levels in the list).

### Code Walk-through
1. **Level Order Traversal**:
   - **Lines 4-6**: Initialize the result `ans`, temporary list `tmp`, and queue `q`. Check if the root is `NULL` and return an empty result if true.
   - **Line 8**: Enqueue the root.
   - **Lines 10-19**: For each level:
      - Determine the number of nodes at the current level (`sz`).
      - Process each node: add its value to `tmp`, enqueue its children, then move to the next node.
      - Append `tmp` to `ans` and clear `tmp` for the next level.
2. **Zigzag Level Order Traversal**:
   - **Lines 22-23**: Call `levelOrder` and store its result in `ans`.
   - **Lines 24-28**: Reverse the values for every other level starting from the first level.
   - **Line 30**: Return the zigzag traversal result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for both `levelOrder` and `zigzagLevelOrder`, where \(N\) is the number of nodes.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\), due to queue storage and result lists.
