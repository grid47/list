### Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to perform a **zigzag level order traversal** of the tree. In a normal level order traversal, nodes are visited level by level from left to right. In zigzag level order traversal, the nodes are visited alternately from left to right and right to left for each level, thus forming a zigzag pattern.

### Approach

To solve the problem, we can break it into two main steps:

1. **Perform level order traversal:** First, we perform the level order traversal of the binary tree to obtain the nodes at each level.
2. **Reversing odd levels:** After obtaining the level order traversal, we reverse the nodes at odd levels (starting from the second level) to achieve the zigzag pattern.

For the level order traversal, we will use a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** approach with the help of a queue. The queue allows us to traverse the tree level by level. After obtaining the level order traversal, we simply reverse the nodes at every alternate level to create the zigzag effect.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. The levelOrder Function

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
    vector<vector<int>> ans;
    vector<int> tmp;
    queue<TreeNode*> q;

    if(root == NULL) return ans;
    q.push(root);
```
- **Input:** We are given the root node of the binary tree (`TreeNode* root`).
- **Output:** We return a vector of vectors (`vector<vector<int>>`), where each inner vector represents a level of the tree, with node values in that level.

- **Initialization:** 
  - `ans`: A 2D vector to store the result of the level order traversal.
  - `tmp`: A temporary vector to store the values at the current level.
  - `q`: A queue to store nodes for level order traversal. We begin by pushing the root node into the queue.
  - If the tree is empty (`root == NULL`), we immediately return an empty vector.

#### 2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Level Order Traversal

```cpp
    while(!q.empty()) {
        int sz = q.size();
        while(sz--) {
            TreeNode* it = q.front();
            q.pop();
            tmp.push_back(it->val);
            if(it->left  != NULL) q.push(it->left);
            if(it->right != NULL) q.push(it->right);
        }
        ans.push_back(tmp);
        tmp.clear();
    }
```
- **Outer Loop:** We continue the BFS as long as the queue is not empty, meaning there are still nodes to process.
- **Inner Loop:** For each level, we:
  - Get the size of the queue (`sz`), which indicates how many nodes are present at the current level.
  - Process all nodes at the current level by dequeuing them one by one (`q.front()`), adding their value to `tmp`, and enqueueing their left and right children (if they exist).
- After processing all nodes at the current level, we add the `tmp` vector (which contains node values at the current level) to the `ans` vector. Then, we clear the `tmp` vector to prepare for the next level.

#### 3. The Zigzag Level Order Function

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> zigzagLevelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
    vector<vector<int>> ans = levelOrder(root);
    for(int i = 1; i < ans.size(); i += 2) {
        vector<int> tmp = ans[i];
        reverse(tmp.begin(), tmp.end());
        ans[i] = tmp;
    }
    return ans;
}
```
- **Input:** This function takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns the zigzag level order traversal.
- **Output:** It returns a 2D vector of integers representing the zigzag level order traversal of the binary tree.

- **Process:**
  - First, we call the `levelOrder` function to get the normal level order traversal of the binary tree. The result is stored in the `ans` vector.
  - Then, we iterate through every **odd-indexed** level (i.e., levels 2, 4, 6, etc.) in the `ans` vector (indexing starts from 0, so we start at index 1).
  - For each odd level, we reverse the corresponding vector of node values to switch the direction of traversal for that level.
  - Finally, we return the modified `ans` vector, which now contains the zigzag level order traversal of the tree.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

- **Level Order Traversal:** 
  - The time complexity of the `levelOrder` function is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once, and for each node, we perform constant time operations (pushing and popping from the queue).

- **Zigzag Reversal:** 
  - Reversing the nodes at odd levels takes **O(n)** time as well. For each level, we reverse the vector, which has a maximum size of `n` (in the worst case, when the tree is a complete binary tree).
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

#### Space Complexity:

- **Level Order Storage:**
  - We store the level order traversal in the `ans` vector, which requires **O(n)** space for the `n` nodes in the tree.
  
- **Queue Storage:**
  - The queue used for BFS can store at most **O(n)** nodes at a time, since the maximum number of nodes at any level is `n/2` in a balanced tree. Thus, the queue will require **O(n)** space in the worst case.

- Therefore, the total space complexity is **O(n)**.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the problem of **zigzag level order traversal** using a two-step approach. First, we perform a **level order traversal** using a queue (BFS), which gives us the nodes in a traditional left-to-right order. Then, we reverse the nodes at every odd level to create the **zigzag** effect. The time and space complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, making it optimal for solving this problem on a binary tree of `n` nodes.
