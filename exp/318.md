### Problem Statement
Given a list of unique words, find the maximum product of lengths of two words where the two words do not share any common letters.

### Approach
The solution employs bit manipulation to efficiently determine whether two words share common letters. The main steps are:

1. **Bitmask Representation**:
   - Create an array `mask` where each element represents a word in the list as a bitmask. Each bit in the mask indicates whether a corresponding letter ('a' to 'z') is present in the word.

2. **Calculating the Mask**:
   - For each word, iterate through its characters and set the respective bits in the bitmask. For example, if the word contains the character 'c', the bit at position `2` (since 'c' is the third letter) is set.

3. **Finding the Maximum Product**:
   - For each word, compare its bitmask with the bitmasks of all previously processed words. If the bitwise AND of the two masks is `0`, it means there are no common letters between the two words.
   - Calculate the product of their lengths and update the maximum product found so far.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A vector of strings `words`.
- **Output**: An integer representing the maximum product of lengths of two words with no common letters.

1. Initialize a mask for each word based on its letters.
2. Compare the masks of each pair of words to determine if they share any common letters.
3. Return the maximum product of the lengths of the valid word pairs.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2 \cdot m)\), where \(n\) is the number of words and \(m\) is the average length of the words. The nested loop compares each pair of words.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the mask array.
