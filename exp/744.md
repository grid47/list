### Problem Statement
Given a sorted array of distinct characters `letters` and a character `target`, find the smallest character in `letters` that is greater than `target`. The array wraps around, meaning that if the target is greater than or equal to the largest character, the answer should be the smallest character in the array.

### Approach
1. **Iterate through the Array**:
   - Traverse the `letters` array from the beginning.
   - Find the first character that is greater than `target`.

2. **Return Result**:
   - If such a character is found, return it. If no character is greater than `target`, return the first character in the array (wrap-around case).

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to find the next greatest letter.

- **Method**:
  - `char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target)`: Implements the logic to find and return the next greatest letter.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of characters in the `letters` array, since we may need to check each character.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional data structures are used.
