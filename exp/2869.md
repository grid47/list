### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to find the minimum number of operations required to remove elements from an array `nums` such that the remaining elements form a subsequence that contains all integers from 1 to `k`. Specifically, we need to find how many elements need to be removed from the array to achieve this. An operation consists of removing any element from the array. 

### Approach

The approach here is to efficiently count the operations needed by iterating over the array from right to left. The goal is to check for the presence of every number from `1` to `k` in the array and count how many elements need to be removed to ensure that these numbers remain. The key idea is to keep track of the numbers that have been encountered from `1` to `k` using a frequency array (`cnt`). We then compute how many elements we need to remove to make sure all numbers from `1` to `k` are in the remaining sequence.

We utilize a greedy approach where we iterate over the array and try to find the smallest subsequence that contains all the numbers from `1` to `k`. To minimize the number of operations, we begin removing elements from the end of the array.

### Code Breakdown

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

```cpp
int cnt[51] = {}, i = nums.size() - 1;
```
- `cnt`: This array is used to track the frequency of each number from `1` to `k` in the subsequence. The array has a size of 51 to accommodate all possible values of `nums[i]` (since `nums[i]` is bounded between 1 and 50).
- `i`: This is the index from which we will start the iteration. We begin from the end of the array (`nums.size() - 1`) because we are looking for the minimum number of removals, and we want to process the elements in reverse order.

#### Step 2: Loop to Find Numbers from `1` to `k`

```cpp
for (int found = 0; found < k; --i)
    if (nums[i] <= k)
        found += cnt[nums[i]]++ == 0;
```
- We iterate from the end of the array and look for the numbers `1` through `k`.
- `found`: This variable keeps track of how many unique numbers from `1` to `k` we have encountered in the array so far. We stop once we have found all numbers from `1` to `k` in the sequence.
- `nums[i] <= k`: We only care about numbers less than or equal to `k`. If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, we ignore it, as it is irrelevant to our subsequence of interest.
- `cnt[nums[i]]++ == 0`: This checks if the current number `nums[i]` is already present in the subsequence. If it is not present (i.e., its count is zero), we increment `found` by 1, meaning we've found another number from `1` to `k`.

#### Step 3: Calculate Number of Removals

```cpp
return nums.size() - i - 1;
```
- Once we have found all the required numbers (`1` to `k`), the index `i` will point to the first number that we do not need to remove in order to form the desired subsequence.
- The total number of elements that need to be removed is simply the total size of the array minus `i - 1` (since `i` is the index of the last number that must remain in the subsequence).
- `nums.size() - i - 1` gives the count of the elements that need to be removed to form the subsequence.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's go through an example to understand how the code works.

**Example 1**:

Input:
```cpp
nums = [5, 3, 1, 4, 2], k = 3
```

**Step-by-Step Execution**:
1. `cnt` is initialized to an array of zeros: `cnt[51] = {0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0}`.
2. We start iterating from the last element (index `4`), which is `2`. Since `2 <= k`, we increment `cnt[2]` and mark that we've found a valid number (2) from the subsequence `1` to `3`. The `found` counter becomes 1.
3. Next, we move to `4` at index `3`. Since `4 > k`, we ignore this element.
4. At index `2`, the number is `1`. We increment `cnt[1]`, and since this is the first occurrence of `1`, the `found` counter becomes 2.
5. At index `1`, the number is `3`. We increment `cnt[3]`, and since this is the first occurrence of `3`, the `found` counter becomes 3.
6. At index `0`, the number is `5`, which is greater than `k`, so we ignore this element.

At this point, we have found all the numbers `1`, `2`, and `3`. The required subsequence is `[1, 2, 3]`.

**Result**:
- The number of elements that need to be removed is `nums.size() - i - 1 = 5 - 2 - 1 = 2`.
- So, the answer is `2`.

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: The algorithm loops through the array once, processing each element in constant time. Since there are no nested loops, the time complexity is linear, i.e., O(n), where `n` is the size of the input array.

### Space Complexity

- **O(k)**: We use a frequency array (`cnt`) of size `k + 1` to keep track of the numbers from `1` to `k`. Since `k` is constant and at most 50, the space complexity is O(k), which is O(1) in practical terms.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the problem by iterating over the array from right to left and greedily keeping track of the numbers needed for the subsequence. The algorithm ensures that only the minimum number of elements are removed by stopping as soon as we have found all numbers from `1` to `k`. The solution is optimal with a linear time complexity of O(n) and a constant space complexity of O(k). This makes it well-suited for large inputs.
