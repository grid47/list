### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers such that the product of those integers is maximized. Return the maximum product you can get.

### Approach
To maximize the product of integers that sum to `n`, the following observations can be made:

1. **Base Cases**: 
   - If \( n = 2 \), the only way to break it is \( 1 + 1 \), which gives a product of \( 1 \).
   - If \( n = 3 \), the optimal break is \( 1 + 2 \), which gives a product of \( 2 \).

2. **Using 3's**:
   - For \( n > 4 \), breaking \( n \) into as many 3's as possible maximizes the product. This is because multiplying by 3 tends to yield a higher product than using larger numbers.
   - Reduce \( n \) by 3 iteratively until it is less than or equal to 4, while accumulating the product.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After the loop, multiply the remaining \( n \) (which will be \( 1, 2, \) or \( 4 \)) to the product.

### Code Walk-through
- The function first checks for the special cases \( n = 2 \) and \( n = 3 \).
- It then enters a loop where it keeps multiplying by 3 until \( n \) is less than or equal to 4.
- Finally, it multiplies the remaining \( n \) to the product and returns the result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \) in the worst case for large values of \( n \) (though typically it converges quickly).
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \) as no additional space proportional to input size is used.
