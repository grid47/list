### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find the maximum number of jumps you can make in a list of integers, `nums`, starting from the first element and following certain jump constraints. Specifically, for each jump from index `i` to `j`, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` must not exceed a given `target`. You need to return the maximum number of jumps possible or `-1` if no jumps can be made.

### Approach

The solution to this problem can be broken down using dynamic programming (DP). The key idea is to maintain a `dp` array that tracks the maximum number of jumps starting from each index of the array. We'll attempt to jump from each index `i` to all subsequent indices `j` where the difference `|nums[i] - nums[j]|` is less than or equal to `target`. We compute the maximum number of jumps recursively, storing the results to avoid redundant computations.

### Code Breakdown

Let's break down the code to understand how the solution works.

#### Class Definition and Member Variables

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int target, n;
    vector<int> memo, nums;
```

1. **target**: This variable holds the maximum allowed difference between consecutive elements for a valid jump.
2. **n**: The number of elements in the `nums` array.
3. **memo**: This vector will store the results of subproblems, i.e., the maximum number of jumps starting from each index. Initially, it is filled with `INT_MIN` to represent uncomputed states.
4. **nums**: This vector holds the input list of integers.

#### Dynamic Programming Helper Function

```cpp
int dp(int idx) {
    if(idx == n - 1) return 0;
    if(memo[idx] != INT_MIN) return memo[idx];
    
    int ans = INT_MIN;
    for(int i = idx + 1; i < n; i++) {
        if(abs(nums[i] - nums[idx]) <= target) {
            ans = max(ans, dp(i) + 1);
        }
    }
    return memo[idx] = ans;
}
```

1. **Base Case**: If `idx == n - 1`, we return `0`, meaning weâ€™ve reached the last index, so no more jumps can be made.
   
2. **Memoization**: Before performing any calculations, we check if the result for the current index `idx` has already been computed by checking if `memo[idx]` is not equal to `INT_MIN`. If it has been computed, we simply return that result, avoiding redundant calculations.

3. **Recursion**: We loop through all indices `i` from `idx + 1` to `n - 1`, and for each index, check if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[idx]` is less than or equal to `target`. If the difference is valid, we recursively compute the maximum jumps from index `i`, and update the result for `idx` as `max(ans, dp(i) + 1)`. The `+1` represents the jump we just made from `idx` to `i`.

4. **Memoization Update**: After computing the result for `idx`, we store it in the `memo` vector so that it can be reused later.

#### Main Function

```cpp
int maximumJumps(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    n = nums.size();
    this->target = target;
    this->nums = nums;
    memo.resize(n, INT_MIN);
    int ans = dp(0);
    return ans <= 0? -1: ans;
}
```

1. **Initialization**: We initialize the size of the `nums` array (`n`), the `target` value, and the `nums` array. Then, we resize the `memo` array to the size of `nums` and fill it with `INT_MIN` to indicate uncalculated states.

2. **Computing the Result**: We call the `dp` function starting from index `0` to compute the maximum number of jumps possible from the first index.

3. **Final Decision**: If the result is `<= 0`, it means no valid jumps are possible, and we return `-1`. Otherwise, we return the computed result, which represents the maximum number of valid jumps.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\), where `n` is the size of the `nums` array. Here's why:
1. For each index `idx`, we loop through all subsequent indices `i` to check if a valid jump can be made. This results in a loop within another loop, leading to \(O(n^2)\) comparisons in the worst case.
2. The memoization reduces redundant recalculations by storing intermediate results, but the overall time complexity remains \(O(n^2)\) due to the nested loop structure.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is \(O(n)\), where `n` is the size of the `nums` array. The space is used for:
1. The `memo` array, which stores the maximum number of jumps from each index.
2. The function call stack for the recursion.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the maximum number of valid jumps that can be made, starting from the first index of the `nums` array and adhering to the jump constraint defined by the `target`. By utilizing dynamic programming with memoization, we avoid redundant calculations and make the solution scalable for larger inputs.

The solution works by recursively calculating the maximum number of jumps for each index while storing intermediate results in the `memo` array. The time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) makes this approach efficient enough for reasonable input sizes.

In summary, this approach is a well-optimized dynamic programming solution that uses memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblems. It provides a clear and efficient method to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of valid jumps in an array.
