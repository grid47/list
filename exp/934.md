### Problem Statement
Given a binary grid `grid` where `0`s represent water and `1`s represent land, the goal is to find the length of the shortest bridge that connects two islands. A bridge is formed by changing `0`s to `1`s and should be as short as possible.

### Approach
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Start by identifying one of the islands using DFS. This will allow us to traverse all the cells that belong to the first island and mark them as visited (set to `-1`).
   - During the DFS, each cell of the first island is added to a queue for later processing.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - After marking the first island, use BFS to explore the water cells adjacent to the first island's cells stored in the queue.
   - For each water cell explored, check its neighbors. If a land cell (`1`) is found, the search is complete, and the current distance (number of steps taken) is returned as the result.

3. **Directional Movement**:
   - The movement is restricted to four directions (up, down, left, right) while ensuring we do not go out of bounds or revisit cells.

### Code Walk-through
- **DFS Function**: 
  - The `dfs` function recursively marks all parts of the first island and populates the queue.
- **BFS Functionality**:
  - The BFS loop processes each cell in the queue, expanding outwards until it reaches another island.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid, as each cell is visited at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the queue used in BFS, which can store all the cells of the first island in the worst case.
