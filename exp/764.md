### Problem Statement
Given an `n x n` grid of `1`s and `0`s where `1` represents a cell that can be part of a plus sign and `0` represents a cell that cannot, the task is to find the order (size) of the largest plus sign that can be formed in the grid. A plus sign consists of a vertical and a horizontal line of `1`s, with the center of the plus sign being the intersection.

### Approach
1. **Grid Initialization**:
   - Create a grid initialized with `n` (the maximum possible arm length of a plus sign).
   - Set the cells corresponding to the mines (where `0` is present) to `0`.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Iterate through the grid, updating each cell with the minimum arm length possible from four directions: left, right, up, and down.
   - For each cell, the arm length in each direction is incremented if the current cell is not a mine.

3. **Finding the Maximum**:
   - After processing the grid, find the maximum value in the grid, which represents the largest plus sign.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method for calculating the largest plus sign.

- **Method**:
  - `int orderOfLargestPlusSign(int n, vector<vector<int>>& mines)`: This method implements the logic to find the size of the largest plus sign.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the dimension of the grid, due to the double iteration through the grid.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2), for storing the grid.
