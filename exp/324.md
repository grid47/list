### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, rearrange the elements of the array in such a way that they form a "wiggle" sequence. A wiggle sequence is defined such that for all `i`:
- `nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3] > nums[4]` and so on.
If there is an even number of elements, the last element should not be considered.

### Approach
The problem can be solved using a three-step process:

1. **Find the Median**: Use the `nth_element` function to partition the array and find the median. This allows us to understand how to arrange the elements into two halves: those less than the median and those greater than the median.

2. **Wiggle Sorting Logic**:
   - Define an access function `A(i)` to reorder the array such that it can be accessed in a wiggle manner: `A(i) = nums[(1 + 2 * i) % (n | 1)]`.
   - This mapping helps distribute the elements in the desired "wiggle" structure.

3. **Partition the Elements**: Use a three-pointer approach:
   - Pointer `i` for the next position to fill with an element greater than the median.
   - Pointer `j` to traverse through the array.
   - Pointer `k` for the next position to fill with an element less than the median.
   - Depending on the comparison of `A(j)` with the median, either swap elements to the correct position and adjust pointers accordingly.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A vector of integers `nums`.
- **Output**: The same vector rearranged into a wiggle sequence.

1. Calculate the size `n` of the input array.
2. Use `nth_element` to find the median and partition the array around it.
3. Iterate through the array, using pointers to swap elements into the correct positions based on their relationship to the median.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) due to the linear partitioning operation used to find the median.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) since the operation is done in-place without using additional data structures.
