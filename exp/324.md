### üöÄ Problem Statement

The task at hand is to **wiggle sort** an input array `nums` such that the elements alternate between smaller and larger values, satisfying the following conditions:
- `nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3] >= nums[4] ...`
  
In other words, the array should be rearranged to create a "wiggle" pattern, where the even indices contain values smaller than or equal to their following odd indices, and the odd indices contain values greater than or equal to their following even indices.

The challenge here is to achieve the desired result **in-place**‚Äîthat is, without using extra space for sorting, while maintaining an efficient solution in terms of both time and space complexity.

### üß† Approach

Achieving the **wiggle sort** efficiently can be done using a clever strategy based on the **median** of the array and **three-way partitioning**. Here's the approach, step by step:

1. **Find the Median**: First, identify the median of the array. This acts as a pivot for splitting the array into elements smaller than the median, equal to the median, and larger than the median.
   
2. **Three-Way Partitioning**: Partition the array into three sections:
   - Elements smaller than the median
   - Elements equal to the median
   - Elements larger than the median
   
3. **Rearrange the Array**: After partitioning, we'll rearrange the elements to ensure the wiggle property is satisfied, ensuring alternating smaller and larger values.

This approach works in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of elements in the array, and **O(1)** space, since the rearrangement is done in place.

### üî® Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

#### Step 1: Find the Median

To start, we need to find the **median** of the array, which is the element that divides the array into two roughly equal halves. We can do this efficiently using the `nth_element` function, which is faster than fully sorting the array.

```cpp
auto midptr = nums.begin() + n / 2;
nth_element(nums.begin(), midptr, nums.end());
int mid = *midptr;
```
- We calculate the middle pointer `midptr`, which gives the position of the median.
- The `nth_element` function finds the median in **O(n)** time.

#### Step 2: Define the Index Mapping Function (`A(i)`)

Next, we need a way to map the indices of the array to their new positions in the wiggle order. This is done using a clever formula:

```cpp
#define A(i) nums[(1 + 2 * i) % (n|1)]
```
- The formula `(1 + 2 * i) % (n | 1)` ensures that even indices are placed at odd positions, and odd indices are placed at even positions, creating the wiggle pattern.

#### Step 3: Partitioning the Array

Now that we have the median, we need to partition the array into three sections: smaller-than-median, equal-to-median, and larger-than-median.

```cpp
int i = 0, j = 0, k = n - 1;
while (j <= k) {
    if (A(j) < mid)
        swap(A(j), A(k--));
    else if (A(j) > mid)
        swap(A(i++), A(j++));
    else j++;
}
```
- We use three pointers: `i` (for the smaller section), `j` (to iterate over the array), and `k` (for the larger section).
- The `while` loop ensures that we correctly partition the array by swapping elements based on their relation to the median.
  
#### Step 4: Rearrangement into Wiggle Order

Once the partitioning is done, the array is rearranged into the desired wiggle order, with alternating smaller and larger values satisfying the wiggle property.

### üìà Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
  - Finding the median using `nth_element` takes **O(n)** time.
  - The partitioning process inside the `while` loop also runs in **O(n)** time, since each element is processed once.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space complexity**: `O(1)`, since we only use a constant amount of extra space (for variables like pointers and indices). The rearrangement is done **in-place** without using any additional data structures.

### üèÅ Conclusion

The **wiggle sort** problem can be solved **efficiently in O(n) time and O(1) space** by utilizing the median and three-way partitioning. This approach guarantees the desired rearrangement without needing extra space or a brute-force sorting approach. The use of the `nth_element` function and a custom index mapping makes this solution both efficient and elegant.

This solution is ideal for scenarios requiring both **time efficiency** and **space efficiency**, making it perfect for **competitive programming** or **real-world applications** where performance is crucial. So, next time you face a wiggle sort problem, remember this elegant and optimal approach! üåü
