### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `arr`, find the length of the longest turbulent subsequence. A turbulent subsequence is defined as one where the signs of the differences between adjacent elements alternate. For example, in a subsequence `[9, 4, 5, 2]`, the differences are negative (9-4) followed by positive (4-5) and negative (5-2).

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Utilize two variables `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` to track the lengths of the turbulent subsequence ending with an upward and downward comparison, respectively.
   - Maintain a variable `prv` to remember the last comparison (0 for no comparison, 1 for upward, -1 for downward).

2. **Iterate Through Array**:
   - For each pair of adjacent elements in `arr`, update `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` based on the comparison:
     - If the current element is greater than the previous one, increase the length of the upward sequence.
     - If the current element is less, increase the length of the downward sequence.
     - If the elements are equal, reset both sequences to 1.
     - If they alternate, reset both sequences to 2 (indicating a valid turbulent pair).
   - Update the result `res` with the maximum length found so far.

3. **Return the Maximum Length**:
   - The maximum length of the turbulent subsequence is returned as the final result.

### Code Walk-through
1. **`maxTurbulenceSize` Method**:
   - Initializes `dp` to track the current lengths of the turbulent subsequences and sets `res` to 1 since a single element is a valid turbulent subsequence.
   - Loops through the array to evaluate the conditions for upward and downward trends.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in `arr`, as each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since only a fixed amount of space is used for variables regardless of the input size.
