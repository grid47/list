### Problem Statement
The task is to generate all unique permutations of a given vector of integers, allowing for duplicates in the input vector. The solution should avoid generating the same permutation multiple times.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a vector (`ans`) to store the unique permutations.
   - Use a recursive helper function `f` that takes the current state of `nums`, the result vector `ans`, and the current index (`ind`) to track the position in `nums`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the current index (`ind`) equals the size of `nums`, it indicates a complete permutation. The current permutation should be added to `ans`.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - Use an unordered map (`mp`) to keep track of the integers that have been used at the current level of recursion.
   - Loop through the elements of `nums` starting from the current index (`ind`).
   - Check if the current integer has already been used at this level (to avoid duplicates).
   - If it hasn't been used:
     - Mark it as used by adding it to the map.
     - Swap the current integer with the integer at the `ind` position to fix the current integer.
     - Recursively call `f` with the next index (`ind + 1`).
     - After the recursive call, swap back the integers to restore the original order.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After all recursive calls complete, return the vector `ans`, which contains all unique permutations.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `permuteUnique` function takes a vector of integers `nums`.

2. **Variables**:
   - `ans`: A vector to store all unique permutations.
   - `mp`: An unordered map to track used integers for the current recursion level.

3. **Backtracking Logic**:
   - The loop iterates through the elements of `nums` starting from the index `ind`.
   - The check with `mp` ensures that duplicate integers are not processed multiple times at the same recursion depth.
   - Swapping the integers allows for generating permutations in place without creating additional copies of `nums`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \times n!)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`. The \(n!\) factor accounts for all unique permutations, and each permutation takes \(O(n)\) to construct.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the recursion stack and the unordered map used to track duplicates, where \(n\) is the depth of recursion (equal to the number of elements).
