### Problem Statement
Given two integers `A` and `B`, representing the counts of characters `'a'` and `'b'`, respectively, create a string such that:
1. It contains exactly `A` occurrences of `'a'` and `B` occurrences of `'b'`.
2. No three consecutive characters in the string are the same.

### Approach
- **Recursive Reordering**: If `B > A`, swap the values and characters so that `A` is always the larger count.
- **String Construction**:
  - While `A > 0`, append character `a` to the result.
  - If `A > B` after this addition, append one more `a` to balance the count difference.
  - If `B > 0`, append character `b` and decrease both `A` and `B` accordingly.
- **Base Case**: Once the loop completes, the string is guaranteed to meet the requirements without three consecutive occurrences of any character.

### Code Walk-through
1. If `B > A`, swap `A` and `B` along with characters `a` and `b` to maintain `A >= B`.
2. Construct the result string by:
   - Adding `a` and then conditionally adding another `a` if `A > B`.
   - Adding `b` if `B > 0`, ensuring no three consecutive characters are the same.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(A + B), as each character is added to the result string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(A + B), as it stores the result string with length `A + B`.
