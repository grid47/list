### Problem Statement
Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, your task is to return the `k` most frequent strings in `words`. If two strings have the same frequency, return them in lexicographical order.

### Approach
The solution uses a combination of a hash map and a priority queue to efficiently count the frequency of each word and retrieve the most frequent ones. Here are the steps involved:

1. **Count Frequencies**:
   - Use an unordered map to count the occurrences of each word in the `words` array.

2. **Priority Queue for Sorting**:
   - Define a custom comparator for a tuple that contains the frequency and the word. The comparator ensures that when the frequencies are equal, words are sorted in reverse lexicographical order.
   - Use a priority queue (min-heap) to store the words along with their frequencies based on the custom comparator.

3. **Extract Top K Frequent Words**:
   - Pop the top `k` elements from the priority queue to retrieve the most frequent words.

### Code Walk-through
- The `topKFrequent` function first builds the frequency map.
- It then pushes each word-frequency pair into a priority queue, where the custom comparator ensures correct ordering.
- Finally, it extracts the top `k` words from the priority queue and returns them in the desired format.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log k), where N is the number of words. This complexity arises from inserting each word into the priority queue and popping `k` elements from it.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for storing the frequency count of each word in the unordered map.

This approach efficiently finds the top `k` frequent words while handling ties in frequency by utilizing lexicographical order.
