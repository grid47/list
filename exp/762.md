### Problem Statement
Given two integers `left` and `right`, count how many integers in the range `[left, right]` (inclusive) have a number of set bits (1s in their binary representation) that is prime.

### Approach
1. **Identify Prime Numbers**:
   - Use a predefined list of prime numbers up to 20 since the maximum number of bits for integers in the range is limited.

2. **Check Set Bits**:
   - Iterate through each integer in the range `[left, right]`.
   - Use the built-in function `__builtin_popcount` to count the number of set bits in the binary representation of the integer.

3. **Count Valid Integers**:
   - For each integer, check if the count of set bits is a prime number using a boolean vector that marks prime numbers.
   - Increment the count for each integer with a prime number of set bits.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to perform the counting.

- **Method**:
  - `int countPrimeSetBits(int left, int right)`: This method executes the main logic of counting integers with prime set bits.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of integers in the range `[left, right]`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the space used for the prime number check is fixed and does not scale with input size.
