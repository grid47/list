### Problem Statement

The problem asks you to count how many numbers between `left` and `right` (inclusive) have a number of set bits (1s in the binary representation) that is a prime number. The task is to calculate how many numbers in this range satisfy this condition.

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Binary Representation**: Every integer has a binary representation, consisting of 0s and 1s. The count of `1`s in the binary representation of a number is referred to as its "set bits."
   
2. **Prime Numbers**: Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. For this problem, we are interested in the number of set bits being a prime number.

For instance, if a number has exactly 3 set bits, then since 3 is prime, it satisfies the condition. You will count how many numbers between `left` and `right` meet this condition.

### Approach

The algorithm can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Identify Prime Numbers**: We need to know which numbers are prime and we only care about the number of set bits (also called Hamming weight) in a number. The possible number of set bits in a number is limited because the largest number we deal with in this problem has a fixed number of bits (in the range of integers).

2. **Count Set Bits**: For each number in the range `[left, right]`, we need to determine how many `1`s (set bits) are in the binary representation of that number.

3. **Check if the Set Bits Count is Prime**: For each number, once we know the number of set bits, we check if that number of set bits is prime. We keep a tally of how many numbers meet the condition.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Define Prime Numbers

```cpp
int prime[]={2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19};
vector<bool> isPrime(21, 0);
for(int p: prime) isPrime[p]=1;
```

- An array `prime[]` is defined to store prime numbers up to 19 (since a number cannot have more than 20 set bits in a typical 32-bit integer representation). This array is used to mark prime numbers.
  
- We then use a vector `isPrime` of size 21 to mark whether a number in the range `0-20` is prime. For each number in the `prime[]` array, the corresponding index in `isPrime` is marked as `1`, indicating that the number at that index is prime.

#### Step 2: Initialize and Iterate Over the Range `[left, right]`

```cpp
int sum=0;
for(int i=left; i<=right; i++){
    int b=__builtin_popcount(i);
    if (isPrime[b]) sum++;
}
```

- We initialize a variable `sum` to keep track of how many numbers in the range `[left, right]` have a prime number of set bits.
  
- The loop iterates over all numbers in the range `[left, right]`. For each number `i`, we use `__builtin_popcount(i)` to count the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `i`. The `__builtin_popcount()` function is a built-in GCC function that efficiently counts the number of `1`s in the binary representation of an integer.
  
- After counting the number of set bits `b`, we check if `b` is a prime number by using the `isPrime` array. If `b` is prime (i.e., `isPrime[b]` is `1`), we increment the `sum` counter.

#### Step 3: Return the Final Count

```cpp
return sum;
```

- After iterating over all the numbers from `left` to `right`, the final count of numbers that have a prime number of set bits is stored in `sum`, which is then returned as the result.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Precomputing primes**: The initialization of the `isPrime` vector takes constant time, i.e., **O(1)**.
  
- **Counting set bits**: For each number in the range `[left, right]`, the time complexity of the `__builtin_popcount(i)` operation is **O(log(i))** because it operates on the binary representation of the number. In the worst case, `log(i)` is proportional to the number of bits in the largest number in the range.
  
- If `n` is the number of integers in the range `[left, right]`, the total time complexity of the loop is **O(n * log(m))**, where `m` is the largest number in the range, because each `__builtin_popcount()` runs in `O(log(m))` time.

- **Final Complexity**: If `n` is the number of elements between `left` and `right`, the overall time complexity is **O(n * log(m))**.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the solution is **O(1)**, as the space used for storing the prime numbers and the result is constant.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently counts how many numbers between `left` and `right` have a prime number of set bits in their binary representation. The algorithm leverages the built-in GCC function `__builtin_popcount()` to count set bits efficiently. By precomputing the prime numbers and using a simple array to mark them, the algorithm ensures that the problem is solved in an optimal manner.

The solution is highly efficient, with a time complexity of **O(n * log(m))** and a space complexity of **O(1)**, making it well-suited for handling large ranges. This approach ensures that we can quickly count numbers with prime set bits even for larger ranges of integers.
