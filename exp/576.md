### Problem Statement:

The problem asks us to find the number of distinct paths that lead outside a grid starting from a given position. Specifically, we are given an `m x n` grid, and from a starting position `(i, j)`, we need to move `mv` times. Each move can either go up, down, left, or right, and our goal is to count the number of ways the path will go outside the grid after exactly `mv` moves.

We are asked to return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is a common practice in competitive programming to prevent overflow.

### Approach:

The problem can be solved using **dynamic programming** (DP) and **depth-first search** (DFS) combined with **memoization**. Here's how we approach the problem:

1. **DFS with Memoization:**
   - We'll perform a DFS search starting from the position `(i, j)`.
   - At each step, we check all four possible moves (up, down, left, right).
   - If we move out of bounds (i.e., we step outside the grid), we count that as a valid path.
   - If we've made `mv` moves, we stop the recursion, as no further moves are allowed.
   
2. **Memoization:**
   - To avoid recalculating the same state multiple times, we use a 3D memoization table `mm` to store the results of subproblems. The state is represented by the number of remaining moves (`mv`), the current row `x`, and the current column `y`.
   - If we reach a state that has already been computed, we return the stored result to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the number of paths can become very large, we use modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure the result fits within the constraints and avoid overflow.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step):

#### Step 1: Initialization and Memoization Setup
```cpp
int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
public:
    int findPaths(int m, int n, int mv, int i, int j) {
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> mm(mv + 1, vector<vector<int>>(m, vector<int>(n, -1)));
        return dfs(m, n, mv, 0, i, j, mm);
    }
```
- We define `mod` as \(10^9 + 7\) to handle the modulo operation.
- In the function `findPaths`, we initialize a 3D vector `mm` with dimensions `(mv + 1, m, n)` to store the results of subproblems. Initially, all values are set to `-1` to indicate that the states are unvisited.
- We then call the DFS function `dfs` with the initial parameters.

#### Step 2: DFS Recursive Function with Memoization
```cpp
int dfs(int m, int n, int mx, int mv, int x, int y, vector<vector<vector<int>>> & mm) {
    if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= m || y >= n) return 1;  // Out of bounds: 1 valid path
    if (mv == mx) return 0;  // Reached maximum moves, can't move further
    if (mm[mv][x][y] > -1) return mm[mv][x][y];  // Return the memoized result
    
    int res = 0;
    // Explore all four directions: down, up, right, left
    res = ( res + dfs(m, n, mx, mv + 1, x + 1, y, mm) ) % mod;  // Move down
    res = ( res + dfs(m, n, mx, mv + 1, x - 1, y, mm) ) % mod;  // Move up
    res = ( res + dfs(m, n, mx, mv + 1, x, y + 1, mm) ) % mod;  // Move right
    res = ( res + dfs(m, n, mx, mv + 1, x, y - 1, mm) ) % mod;  // Move left
    
    return mm[mv][x][y] = (res % mod);  // Store the result in memoization table
}
```

- **Base Case (Out of Bounds):** If the current position `(x, y)` is outside the grid (i.e., `x < 0` or `y < 0` or `x >= m` or `y >= n`), we return `1` because we've successfully moved outside the grid, which is a valid path.
  
- **Base Case (Max Moves):** If we've made `mv` moves, we return `0` because we've reached the maximum number of allowed moves without going out of bounds, so no valid path exists from here.

- **Memoization Check:** Before performing any recursive calls, we check if the current state `(mv, x, y)` has already been computed. If so, we return the stored result to avoid redundant calculations.

- **Recursive Exploration:** We explore all four possible directions: moving down (`x + 1`), up (`x - 1`), right (`y + 1`), and left (`y - 1`). For each move, we make a recursive call and accumulate the results.

- **Modulo Operation:** Since the number of paths can be large, we apply modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to the results to ensure we don't exceed the limits and avoid overflow.

- **Store Result:** Finally, we store the result of the current state `(mv, x, y)` in the memoization table `mm` and return it.

#### Step 3: Final Return
- The final result is obtained by calling the `dfs` function with the initial position `(i, j)` and starting from `0` moves. The result is then returned to `findPaths`.

### Complexity:

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n * mv):** In the worst case, we may need to calculate the result for each state `(mv, x, y)` where `mv` ranges from `0` to `mv`, and `(x, y)` ranges over the grid of size `m * n`. Thus, the total number of unique states is `m * n * mv`, and since we only calculate each state once (due to memoization), the time complexity is O(m * n * mv).

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(m * n * mv):** We use a 3D array `mm` to store the results for all states. The size of this array is `(mv + 1) * m * n`, so the space complexity is O(m * n * mv).

### Conclusion:

This solution efficiently calculates the number of distinct paths that lead outside the grid using a combination of dynamic programming and depth-first search with memoization. The recursive DFS explores all possible paths while ensuring that each state is computed only once, thus reducing the computational overhead. By using memoization, we avoid redundant calculations and optimize the solution. The time complexity of O(m * n * mv) ensures that the solution can handle larger inputs within the given constraints. The modulo operation ensures that the results stay within the bounds of typical integer ranges in programming contests.
