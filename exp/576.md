### Problem Statement
You are given a grid of size `m x n`, and a starting point `(i, j)`. You can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right, and you can do this at most `mv` times. The objective is to find the number of paths that lead out of the grid.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
   - Use a 3D vector `mm` to store the number of paths from a specific point `(x, y)` with `mv` moves left.
   - The dimensions of `mm` will be `(mv + 1) x m x n`.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Create a recursive function `dfs` that takes parameters for the grid size `(m, n)`, the maximum moves `mx`, the current move count `mv`, and the current position `(x, y)`.
   - Base cases:
     - If the current position `(x, y)` is out of bounds (i.e., `x < 0` or `y < 0` or `x >= m` or `y >= n`), it means a path has successfully moved out of the grid, so return 1.
     - If the maximum moves have been reached (`mv == mx`), return 0 since no more moves can be made.
     - If the result for `(mv, x, y)` is already computed (i.e., `mm[mv][x][y] > -1`), return that stored value.

3. **Exploration of All Directions**:
   - From the current position, recursively call `dfs` for all four possible movements: down, up, right, and left.
   - Sum up the results from these calls, ensuring to take modulo `10^9 + 7` to prevent overflow.

### Code Walk-through
- The `findPaths` function initializes the memoization table and calls `dfs`.
- The `dfs` function checks the base cases and recursively explores all four directions, updating the memoization table with the computed results.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n * mv), since we might potentially compute the value for every cell `(x, y)` for every move `mv`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n * mv), for the memoization table `mm`.
