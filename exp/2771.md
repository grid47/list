### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find the maximum length of a non-decreasing subsequence that can be obtained by either:
1. Taking elements from `nums1` or `nums2` directly, or
2. By swapping elements from `nums1[i]` with `nums2[i]` for each index `i`.

The objective is to compute the maximum length of such a subsequence, which may include swaps or no swaps at all, and return this maximum length.

### Approach

The solution uses dynamic programming (DP) to solve the problem efficiently. The key idea is to maintain two DP arrays, `dp1` and `dp2`, where:
- `dp1[i]` stores the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at index `i` where the last element of the subsequence comes from `nums1[i]`.
- `dp2[i]` stores the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at index `i` where the last element of the subsequence comes from `nums2[i]`.

At each step, we decide whether to extend the subsequence from either `nums1` or `nums2` and whether to swap the current elements to ensure the subsequence remains non-decreasing.

### Code Breakdown

#### Function 1: `Boom`

```cpp
int Boom(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
    int n = nums1.size();
    int ans = 1;
    vector<int> dp1(n, 1), dp2(n, 1);
```
- **`n`**: The size of the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
- **`dp1`** and **`dp2`**: Two vectors initialized to size `n`, representing the longest non-decreasing subsequences ending at each index, initialized to `1` because the minimum subsequence length for any element is `1`.

```cpp
    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {         
        for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if(nums1[i] >= nums1[j]) {
                dp1[i] = max(dp1[i], dp1[j] + 1);
            }
            if(nums1[i] >= nums2[j]) {
                dp1[i] = max(dp1[i], dp2[j] + 1);                    
            }
            if(nums2[i] >= nums1[j]) {
                dp2[i] = max(dp2[i], dp1[j] + 1);                    
            }                 
            if(nums2[i] >= nums2[j]) {
                dp2[i] = max(dp2[i], dp2[j] + 1);                                        
            }
        }
        ans = max(ans, max(dp1[i], dp2[i]));          
    }
```
- The nested loops iterate through each pair of indices `(i, j)` where `j < i`.
- For each pair, we check four possible conditions:
  1. `nums1[i] >= nums1[j]`: If this condition holds, we extend the subsequence by adding `nums1[i]` to the subsequence that ends at `j` and comes from `nums1`.
  2. `nums1[i] >= nums2[j]`: We check if we can extend the subsequence from `nums2[j]` to `nums1[i]`.
  3. `nums2[i] >= nums1[j]`: We check if we can extend the subsequence from `nums1[j]` to `nums2[i]`.
  4. `nums2[i] >= nums2[j]`: We check if we can extend the subsequence from `nums2[j]` to `nums2[i]`.

- We update `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` to store the maximum subsequence length at index `i` using the conditions above.
- Finally, we update the answer `ans` to store the maximum of the current `ans` and the maximum value between `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` for each `i`.

#### Function 2: `maxNonDecreasingLength`

```cpp
int maxNonDecreasingLength(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
    int n = nums1.size();
    int ans = 1;
    vector<int> dp1(n, 1), dp2(n, 1);
```
- **`n`**: The size of the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
- **`dp1`** and **`dp2`**: These arrays store the longest non-decreasing subsequences ending at each index with values from `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively. They are initialized to `1`, as the minimum length of a subsequence is 1.

```cpp
    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {         
        if(nums1[i] >= nums1[i - 1]) {
            dp1[i] = max(dp1[i], dp1[i - 1] + 1);
        }
        if(nums1[i] >= nums2[i - 1]) {
            dp1[i] = max(dp1[i], dp2[i - 1] + 1);                    
        }
        if(nums2[i] >= nums1[i - 1]) {
            dp2[i] = max(dp2[i], dp1[i - 1] + 1);                    
        }                 
        if(nums2[i] >= nums2[i - 1]) {
            dp2[i] = max(dp2[i], dp2[i - 1] + 1);                                        
        }
        ans = max(ans, max(dp1[i], dp2[i]));          
    }
```
- The loop starts from index `1` and checks for possible extensions of subsequences:
  1. **`nums1[i] >= nums1[i - 1]`**: If this condition is true, the subsequence can be extended using `nums1[i]`.
  2. **`nums1[i] >= nums2[i - 1]`**: This checks whether a valid subsequence can be formed by swapping `nums2[i-1]` and `nums1[i]`.
  3. **`nums2[i] >= nums1[i - 1]`**: Similarly, this checks the condition where the subsequence can be extended from `nums1[i-1]` to `nums2[i]`.
  4. **`nums2[i] >= nums2[i - 1]`**: This checks whether the subsequence can be extended using `nums2[i]`.

- After checking all conditions, `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` are updated to reflect the longest subsequence that ends at index `i` in either `nums1` or `nums2`.
- Finally, the maximum value of `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` is taken to update the result `ans`.

```cpp
    return ans;
}
```
- The function returns the maximum length of the non-decreasing subsequence that can be achieved by either directly taking elements from `nums1` and `nums2` or by swapping elements as needed.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\), where `n` is the size of the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. This is because for each index `i`, we check all previous indices `j` using a nested loop, resulting in a quadratic time complexity.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is \(O(n)\), where `n` is the size of the input arrays. We use two arrays `dp1` and `dp2` to store the longest subsequences ending at each index, and this requires space proportional to the size of the input arrays.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently calculates the maximum length of a non-decreasing subsequence that can be obtained from the arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, either by directly taking elements or by swapping elements for each index. By using dynamic programming with two arrays, `dp1` and `dp2`, we can keep track of the maximum subsequences that can be formed, ensuring that the solution is both efficient and easy to understand.

The time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) is appropriate for this problem, and the space complexity of \(O(n)\) ensures that the solution can handle large inputs within reasonable limits.
