### Problem Statement

The problem at hand asks us to find the shortest path that visits all nodes in a graph, where the graph is represented by a directed graph, and each node can be visited multiple times. The problem can be modeled as a variation of the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, where we are trying to determine the minimum number of steps required to visit all nodes starting from any node, and we can only visit nodes that are directly connected (i.e., adjacent nodes in the graph). 

Given a graph with nodes and edges, our goal is to find the shortest path that visits every node at least once.

### Example:
- **Input**: A graph represented by an adjacency list `gph = [[1,2,3], [0], [0], [0]]`.
- **Output**: The length of the shortest path that visits all nodes, starting from any node.

In this case, the shortest path visits all nodes and the correct output would be the minimal number of steps required to visit all nodes at least once.

### Approach

This problem can be solved using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** with a state-space search, where the state at any point consists of:
- The set of visited nodes (`mask`).
- The current node (`cur`).
- The cost or number of steps taken so far (`cost`).

To approach this problem:
1. **State Representation**: We can represent the state of the traversal as a combination of the bitmask of visited nodes and the current node.
   - `mask`: A bitmask representing which nodes have been visited. If there are `n` nodes in the graph, then the `mask` can be a binary number of `n` bits, where each bit corresponds to whether a node has been visited (1) or not (0).
   - `cur`: The current node being visited.
   - `cost`: The number of steps taken so far.

2. **BFS Traversal**: We use BFS to explore all possible states starting from each node. In each step, we expand to neighboring nodes and keep track of the nodes visited and the steps taken.

3. **State Pruning**: To avoid revisiting the same state, we use a **set** to keep track of visited states (combinations of visited nodes and current node).

4. **Termination Condition**: The BFS stops when we visit a state where all nodes have been visited. At that point, the corresponding `cost` represents the minimum number of steps required to visit all nodes.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Define the Node Class

We start by defining a `Node` class to store the state. Each `Node` object contains:
- `mask`: The bitmask representing the visited nodes.
- `cur`: The current node being visited.
- `cost`: The number of steps taken so far to reach this state.

```cpp
class Node {
public:
    int mask, cur, cost;
    Node(int msk, int cu, int cos) {
        mask = msk;
        cur = cu;
        cost = cos;
    }
    int eq(Node *n) {
        return n->mask == this->mask && n->cur == this->cur && n->cost == this->cost;
    }
    int hash() {
        return 1331 * this->mask + 7193 * this->cur + 727 * this->cost;
    }
};
```

The `hash` function is used to generate a unique identifier for each state to efficiently check if a state has already been visited.

#### Step 2: Initialize BFS Queue and Set

We initialize a **queue** for BFS and a **set** to track the visited states. For each node in the graph, we create a `Node` object representing the starting state (with only that node visited).

```cpp
set<int> s;
queue<Node*> q;
for (int i = 0; i < gph.size(); i++) {
    Node* tmp = new Node(1 << i, i, 0);
    s.insert(tmp->hash());
    q.push(tmp);
}
```

The `set` ensures that we do not revisit the same state, and the `queue` facilitates the BFS traversal.

#### Step 3: BFS Loop for State Expansion

We start the BFS loop, where we pop a node from the queue, expand its state, and push the new states (neighboring nodes) into the queue if they haven’t been visited.

```cpp
while (!q.empty()) {
    Node* tmp = q.front();
    q.pop();
    
    if (tmp->mask == (1 << gph.size()) - 1) {
        return tmp->cost;
    }
    
    for (auto x : gph[tmp->cur]) {
        int msk = tmp->mask;
        msk |= (1 << x);
        Node* t = new Node(msk, x, 0);
        if (!s.count(t->hash())) {
            q.push(new Node(msk, x, tmp->cost + 1));
            s.insert(t->hash());
        }
    }
}
```

- We check if the current state has visited all nodes (`tmp->mask == (1 << gph.size()) - 1`). If so, we return the `cost` (number of steps taken so far).
- For each neighbor of the current node, we update the `mask` by marking the neighbor as visited (`msk |= (1 << x)`).
- We create a new `Node` object with the updated state and push it to the queue if it hasn’t been visited before (`!s.count(t->hash())`).

#### Step 4: Return the Result

If the queue is empty and no solution is found (i.e., the BFS traversal does not visit all nodes), we return `-1`.

```cpp
return -1;
```

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n * 2^n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph. This is because we explore all possible combinations of visited nodes (there are `2^n` possible masks) and for each state, we may process up to `n` neighbors.
- For each state, the `hash` function is constant time (`O(1)`), and the state insertions and lookups in the `set` are also constant time on average.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(n * 2^n)**, as we need to store all possible states in the `set` and the `queue`. Each state is represented by a bitmask of size `n` and the current node index.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the problem of finding the shortest path that visits all nodes in a graph using a BFS approach combined with bitmasking. The use of a queue for BFS and a set for state tracking ensures that we explore the graph in the shortest possible steps. Although the time and space complexities are exponential, this solution is feasible for relatively small graphs where the number of nodes (`n`) is not large. This approach is a good example of how bitmasking and BFS can be used together to solve problems related to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and graph traversal.
