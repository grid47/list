### Problem Statement
You are given a directed graph represented as an adjacency list, where each node represents a state (like a city or a junction). The goal is to find the shortest path that visits all nodes in the graph, starting from any node.

### Approach
1. **Node Representation**: Create a `Node` class to represent the state of the search, including:
   - `mask`: A bitmask representing the set of visited nodes.
   - `cur`: The current node.
   - `cost`: The cost (or distance) to reach this node from the starting node.

2. **Initialize Queue and Set**:
   - Use a queue to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) on the nodes.
   - Initialize a set to keep track of visited states (to avoid cycles and redundant checks).

3. **Start BFS**:
   - For each node in the graph, initialize a `Node` with the corresponding mask (indicating that only this node is visited), the current node, and a cost of zero. Push this node onto the queue and add its hash to the set of visited states.

4. **Process Nodes**:
   - Dequeue a node and check if it has visited all nodes (i.e., if its mask is equal to `(1 << gph.size()) - 1`).
   - If it has, return the cost of reaching this node, as it represents the shortest path that visits all nodes.
   - For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the new mask by setting the bit corresponding to the neighbor. If this new state (represented by a new `Node`) has not been visited yet, push it onto the queue and mark it as visited.

5. **Return Result**: If the queue is exhausted without visiting all nodes, return `-1`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * 2^N), where N is the number of nodes in the graph. This accounts for the number of states (visited nodes) and the time taken to process each state.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N * 2^N) for storing the set of visited states and the queue of nodes.
