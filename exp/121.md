### Problem Statement
Given an array of stock prices `prices`, where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day, find the maximum profit you can achieve by buying and selling the stock. You may complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock).

### Approach
1. Initialize `l` (lowest price seen so far) to the first price and `g` (maximum profit) to 0.
2. Iterate through each price in the `prices` vector:
   - Update `l` to be the minimum of the current `l` and the current price.
   - Calculate the profit if selling at the current price (`x - l`) and update `g` to be the maximum profit found so far.
3. Return `g`, which will contain the maximum profit achievable.

### Code Walk-through
- **`maxProfit` function**:
  - **Line 2**: Initialize `l` to the first element of `prices` and `g` to 0.
  - **Line 3**: Loop through each price `x` in the `prices` vector.
    - **Line 4**: Update `l` to the minimum of `l` and `x`.
    - **Line 5**: Update `g` to the maximum of `g` and the profit calculated as `x - l`.
  
- **Line 6**: Return `g`, which represents the maximum profit.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of days (length of the `prices` array), as we make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since we only use a constant amount of space for the variables `l` and `g`.
