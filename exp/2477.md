### Problem Statement:
The problem involves calculating the minimum fuel cost required to transport people between cities connected by roads. The cities are represented by nodes in a tree structure, and the roads are represented by edges. The goal is to determine the minimum fuel cost to transport people from city 0 (the root) to all other cities, with the constraint that each vehicle can carry at most `seats` passengers. The fuel cost for each trip is calculated based on the number of vehicles needed to transport people, where each vehicle requires 1 unit of fuel for each road it travels.

### Approach:
The key idea is to model the problem as a tree, where each node represents a city and each edge represents a road between two cities. The problem becomes one of determining the minimum number of vehicles required to transport people from the root (city 0) to all other cities, using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. 

#### Detailed Steps:
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - First, we represent the roads as an undirected graph using an adjacency list. This allows us to easily traverse the tree from any node to any other connected node.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - We perform a DFS traversal starting from city 0 (the root). The DFS function keeps track of the number of people in the subtree rooted at each node, which includes the node itself and all its descendants.
   - For each node (city), we calculate how many vehicles are needed to transport all the people in that node’s subtree. The number of vehicles required is the ceiling of `people/seats`, which can be calculated as `(people + seats - 1) / seats` (a trick to avoid using floating-point arithmetic).

3. **Accumulate Fuel Costs**:
   - As we visit each node, we accumulate the fuel cost based on how many vehicles are required to transport the people from that node to its parent.
   - For the root node (city 0), we don't accumulate any fuel cost because it’s the starting point. However, for all other nodes, we accumulate the required fuel cost by adding the vehicles needed to transport the people in that subtree.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After the DFS traversal, the accumulated fuel cost will be the minimum fuel cost required to transport people from the root (city 0) to all other cities in the tree.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step):
Now, let’s go through the code and explain each part in detail:

1. **Function Definition and Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   long long ans;
   int s;
   long long minimumFuelCost(vector<vector<int>>& roads, int seats) {
       vector<vector<int>> graph(roads.size() + 1); s = seats;
       for (vector<int> r: roads){
           graph[r[0]].push_back(r[1]);
           graph[r[1]].push_back(r[0]);
       }
       dfs(0, 0, graph);
       return ans;
   }
   ```
   - The function `minimumFuelCost` takes two inputs: `roads`, which is a list of edges (roads between cities), and `seats`, which is the number of seats in each vehicle.
   - The graph is initialized as an adjacency list to represent the cities and roads. The graph has `roads.size() + 1` nodes, because the number of nodes is one more than the number of edges in the tree.
   - The `dfs` function is called starting from city 0, with a parent node of 0 (because city 0 is the root).

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   ```cpp
   int dfs(int i, int prev, vector<vector<int>> &graph) {
       int people = 1;  // Start with 1 person (the current city itself)
       for(int &x: graph[i]) {
           if (x == prev) continue;  // Skip the parent node
           people += dfs(x, i, graph);  // Add the number of people from the child node
       }
       if(i != 0) ans += (s + people - 1) / s;  // If it's not the root, add the fuel cost
       return people;
   }
   ```
   - The function `dfs` is a recursive function that traverses the tree.
   - `i` is the current node (city), and `prev` is the parent node of the current node.
   - The variable `people` is initialized to 1, representing the current node itself.
   - The DFS function recursively calls itself on each child node (`x`), skipping the parent node to avoid cycles.
   - After visiting all the child nodes, the `people` variable will contain the total number of people in the subtree rooted at the current node.
   - If the current node is not the root (i.e., `i != 0`), we calculate the number of vehicles required to transport `people` people, and we add that to the fuel cost (`ans`). The number of vehicles is `(people + seats - 1) / seats`, which gives the ceiling of `people / seats`.
   - Finally, the function returns the total number of people in the subtree rooted at the current node.

3. **Result**:
   - Once the DFS traversal is complete, the variable `ans` will contain the total fuel cost, which is returned as the result.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **DFS Traversal**: The DFS function visits each node exactly once and processes each edge exactly once. Therefore, the time complexity for the DFS traversal is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree (which is equal to `roads.size() + 1`).
  - **Overall Time Complexity**: Since the DFS is the only major operation in this algorithm, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - **Graph Representation**: The space complexity for storing the graph is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - **Recursion Stack**: The depth of the recursion stack will be at most \(O(n)\), since the tree is a connected acyclic graph.
  - **Overall Space Complexity**: The total space complexity is \(O(n)\), dominated by the space required to store the graph and the recursion stack.

### Conclusion:
The algorithm efficiently calculates the minimum fuel cost required to transport people in a tree structure of cities using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. By leveraging the properties of DFS and taking advantage of the tree structure, we can calculate the total fuel cost in linear time, \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of cities. This approach ensures that the solution is both time and space-efficient, making it suitable for large input sizes. The use of integer arithmetic to compute the number of vehicles avoids the need for floating-point operations and keeps the solution simple and fast.
