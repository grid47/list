### Problem Statement
You are given a dictionary of words and a sentence. The goal is to replace every word in the sentence with the root word from the dictionary that can replace it. If no root word can replace a word in the sentence, the original word should remain unchanged.

### Approach
1. **Trie Data Structure**:
   - Use a Trie (prefix tree) to efficiently store and search for root words.
   - Each node in the Trie represents a character, and nodes are linked to represent words.

2. **Insertion into Trie**:
   - Create a method to insert words from the dictionary into the Trie. Each character of a word corresponds to a path in the Trie.
   - Mark the end of a word in the Trie using a boolean flag.

3. **Word Replacement**:
   - For each word in the sentence, traverse the Trie to find the longest prefix that matches the word.
   - If a matching prefix is found (which indicates a root word), replace the word with this prefix; otherwise, keep the original word.

4. **Sentence Construction**:
   - Use a string stream to read the sentence word by word, replacing each word as necessary, and construct the final modified sentence.

### Code Walk-through
1. **TrieNode Class**:
   - This class represents each node in the Trie, containing an array of child nodes and a boolean indicating the end of a word.

2. **Solution Class**:
   - Contains methods to insert words into the Trie and check for root replacements.
   - `replaceWords` method handles the sentence processing.

3. **Insert Method**:
   - Iterates through characters of a word and creates nodes in the Trie if they do not already exist.

4. **Check Method**:
   - Traverses the Trie for a given word and returns the shortest prefix if it matches a root word; otherwise, it returns the original word.

5. **Final Assembly**:
   - After processing all words, the result is constructed by joining the replaced words and returning the final string.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * L), where N is the number of words in the sentence and L is the maximum length of a word in the dictionary. Insertion and search operations in the Trie are efficient due to their prefix nature.
- **Space Complexity**: O(M), where M is the total number of characters in all the root words combined, due to the space used by the Trie.
