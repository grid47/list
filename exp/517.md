### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums`. In one move, you can increment or decrement any element by 1. Your goal is to equalize all elements in the array. Return the minimum number of moves required to equalize the array elements, or -1 if it is not possible.

### Approach
1. **Calculate the Total Sum**:
   - First, compute the sum of all elements in the array using `accumulate`.

2. **Check for Equalization**:
   - If the total sum is not divisible by the number of elements `n`, return -1 because equalization is impossible.
   - If the sum is zero, return 0, as all elements are already equal.

3. **Determine Target Value**:
   - Calculate the target value `hit` as `sum / n`, which represents the desired value for each element after equalization.

4. **Prefix and Suffix Sums**:
   - Use two vectors, `left` and `right`, to store the cumulative sums of the elements to the left and right of each index:
     - `left[i]` accumulates the sum of elements from the start to the index `i-1`.
     - `right[i]` accumulates the sum of elements from the index `i+1` to the end.

5. **Calculate Moves**:
   - For each index in the array:
     - Calculate the expected left sum `expLeft` and the expected right sum `expRight`.
     - Determine how many moves are needed to meet these expectations by comparing `expLeft` with `left[i]` and `expRight` with `right[i]`.
     - Update the result `res` with the maximum moves needed for each index.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `findMinMoves` function takes a vector `nums` as input.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - Calculate the sum and size of the vector. Perform checks for divisibility and zero sum.

3. **Initialize Vectors**:
   - Initialize `left` and `right` vectors to store cumulative sums.

4. **Fill Cumulative Sums**:
   - Use loops to fill `left` and `right` arrays.

5. **Evaluate Moves**:
   - Iterate through the elements, compute expected sums, and calculate the required moves for each position.

6. **Return Result**:
   - Return the maximum moves needed across all indices.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This includes the time for calculating the sum and filling the `left` and `right` arrays.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the storage of the `left` and `right` cumulative sum arrays.
