### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, the task is to return the minimum number of increments required to make all elements unique.

### Approach
1. **Sorting**:
   - Start by sorting the array `nums`. This helps in easily identifying duplicates and determining the necessary increments.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize two variables: `res` to store the total number of increments and `need` to track the next required unique number.

3. **Iterate through the Array**:
   - Loop through each element in the sorted array:
     - Calculate how much we need to increment the current element to make it unique:
       - If the current element is less than `need`, add the difference (`need - nums[i]`) to `res`.
       - Update `need` to be the maximum of the current element and `need`, then increment it by 1 to account for the next unique number.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all elements, return the total increments stored in `res`.

### Code Walk-through
- The function sorts the input array, initializes necessary variables, and iterates through the sorted array to compute the total increments needed for uniqueness.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.
