### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of non-empty subarrays that have a sum divisible by `k`.

### Approach
1. **Prefix Sum and Remainders**:
   - Use a prefix sum to keep track of the cumulative sum of elements as we iterate through the array.
   - Calculate the remainder of the prefix sum when divided by `k` to determine if a subarray sum is divisible by `k`.

2. **Frequency Array**:
   - Maintain a frequency array `frq` where `frq[i]` counts how many times a remainder `i` has occurred.
   - Initialize `frq[0]` to `1` to account for the case where a prefix sum itself is divisible by `k`.

3. **Iterate through `nums`**:
   - For each element, update the prefix sum and compute the current remainder.
   - Adjust the remainder to ensure it is non-negative (i.e., `rm = (sum % k + k) % k`).
   - Increment the result `res` by the frequency of the current remainder.
   - Update the frequency array with the current remainder.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing all elements, `res` will contain the count of subarrays whose sums are divisible by `k`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **`subarraysDivByK` Method**:
   - Initializes variables for the result, prefix sum, and frequency array.
   - Loops through the `nums` array, updating the prefix sum and using the frequency array to count valid subarrays.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`, as we traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), for the frequency array.
