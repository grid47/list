### Problem Statement
The function `maxDistance` is designed to solve the "As Far from Land as Possible" problem. The input is an `n x n` grid, where each cell can either be land (`1`) or water (`0`). The goal is to find the cell that is the farthest distance from any land cell and return that distance. If no such water cell exists or if all cells are either land or water, return `-1`.

### Approach
The approach uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** starting from all land cells simultaneously. This is similar to a multi-source BFS, where every land cell is treated as a starting point. The BFS expands outward from each land cell, calculating the distance to each water cell, until all reachable cells are processed. The BFS guarantees that the first time a cell is reached, it is the shortest possible path to that cell.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the function implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistance(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
```

- **Line 2-4**: The function `maxDistance` begins by initializing `n` to store the size of the grid (which is square-shaped, so `n x n`).
- `q` is a queue of pairs, used to hold the coordinates `(i, j)` of each land cell as BFS starting points.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            if(grid[i][j] == 1) {
                q.push(make_pair(i, j));
                grid[i][j] = 0;
            } else grid[i][j] = -1;
```

- **Lines 5-10**: A nested `for` loop iterates over each cell in the grid.
    - If the cell is a land cell (`grid[i][j] == 1`), it is added to the queue `q`, and its value is set to `0` to mark it as processed.
    - If the cell is water (`grid[i][j] == 0`), it is marked as `-1` to distinguish it from unvisited cells in the BFS.

```cpp
        if(q.empty() || q.size() == n * n) return -1;
```

- **Line 11**: This line checks if there are no land cells (`q.empty()`) or if the grid is filled only with land cells (`q.size() == n * n`). In either case, the function returns `-1` because there’s no valid water cell to calculate a distance.

```cpp
        int dir[] = {0, 1, 0, -1, 0};
        int mx = 1;
```

- **Line 13-14**: An array `dir` defines the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) for movement. `mx` is initialized to 1 to keep track of the maximum distance found.

```cpp
        while(!q.empty()) {
            pair<int, int> tmp = q.front();
            q.pop();
```

- **Lines 15-17**: A `while` loop processes each cell in the queue. `tmp` holds the coordinates of the current cell being processed, and it is then removed from the queue.

```cpp
            for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                int x = tmp.first + dir[i], y = tmp.second + dir[i + 1];
                if(x < 0 || y < 0 || x == n || y == n || grid[x][y] != -1)
                    continue;
```

- **Lines 18-21**: This nested `for` loop iterates over the four possible movement directions. For each direction:
    - New coordinates `(x, y)` are calculated based on `tmp`.
    - If `(x, y)` is out of bounds or already visited (`grid[x][y] != -1`), it’s skipped.

```cpp
                cout << grid[tmp.first][tmp.second] << " ";
                grid[x][y] = grid[tmp.first][tmp.second] + 1;
                q.push(make_pair(x, y));
                mx = max(mx, grid[x][y]);
            }
        }
        return mx;
    }
};
```

- **Lines 22-28**: For each valid cell `(x, y)`:
    - The `cout` statement outputs the current value, helping track the BFS process during debugging.
    - `grid[x][y]` is updated to `grid[tmp.first][tmp.second] + 1`, which represents the distance from the nearest land cell.
    - `(x, y)` is added to the queue `q` for further exploration.
    - `mx` is updated to track the maximum distance found.
- Finally, `mx` is returned as the result.

### Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the grid’s dimension. Each cell is visited once during BFS, and the `for` loop checks each of the four directions per cell.
2. **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), as the queue may store up to all water cells at the beginning.

### Conclusion
The `maxDistance` function is an efficient BFS-based solution that finds the farthest water cell from any land cell in a grid. It handles edge cases like grids with only land or only water and leverages multi-source BFS to avoid redundant distance calculations. This algorithm can be particularly useful in pathfinding applications in 2D grids where distance from a specific region is crucial, such as urban planning, environmental analysis, and game development.

This function is optimized for performance and follows a clear, systematic BFS approach, making it a reliable choice for problems involving the shortest distance in grid structures.
