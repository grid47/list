### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears three times except for one, find the single element that appears only once.

### Approach
1. **Bit Manipulation**:
   - Use two integers, `ones` and `twos`, to track the count of bits appearing once and twice.
   - For each number in the array, update these two integers using bitwise operations:
     - **ones**: Represents bits that have appeared once.
     - **twos**: Represents bits that have appeared twice.
   - The goal is to ensure that when a bit appears three times, it is removed from both `ones` and `twos`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 5**: Initialize `n` to the size of the `nums` array.
- **Line 7**: Initialize `ones` and `twos` to 0.
- **Line 8**: Iterate through each number in the `nums` array.
  - **Line 9**: Update `ones` to hold the XOR of `ones` and the current number, while ensuring bits counted in `twos` are excluded.
  - **Line 10**: Update `twos` similarly to hold the XOR of `twos` and the current number, while excluding bits counted in `ones`.
- **Line 11**: Return the value in `ones`, which will be the single number.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in the `nums` array, as we need to iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
