### Problem Statement

We are tasked with determining the number of ways to reach a target position from a starting position with exactly `k` moves, where each move can either increase, decrease, or keep the current position unchanged. The positions are considered on a one-dimensional number line, and we are given two integers: `start` and `end`, which represent the initial and target positions, respectively.

Given the constraints:
- We need to calculate how many different ways we can move from `start` to `end` using exactly `k` moves.

For example:
- **Input**: `start = 1, end = 3, k = 2`
- **Output**: `1`
  - Explanation: The only valid sequence of moves is: 1 → 2 → 3.

### Approach

This problem can be viewed as a dynamic programming problem where we want to count the number of valid sequences of moves that bring us from the `start` position to the `end` position in exactly `k` moves. Here's the step-by-step approach to solving the problem:

1. **Recursive Exploration**:
   - At each step, we can either:
     - Increase the current position.
     - Decrease the current position.
     - Stay at the current position.
   - Given that we are allowed exactly `k` moves, we need to explore all possible paths from `start` to `end` using these three types of moves.

2. **Dynamic Programming to Avoid Redundant Calculations**:
   - Instead of recalculating the number of ways for the same state multiple times, we use a **memoization** technique with a dynamic programming table (`dp`). This table will store the results for subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The `dp[k][d]` entry represents the number of ways to move from `start` to `end` with exactly `k` moves, where the current distance is `d` (distance between the current position and the target position).

3. **Base Case**:
   - If the current distance is greater than the number of remaining moves, then there are no valid paths to the target. Thus, the result is `0` in such cases.
   - If the distance is equal to the number of remaining moves (`d == k`), it means we have exactly reached the target in the given number of moves. This is the base case of our recursion.

4. **Memoization**:
   - We will use memoization to store already computed results for a given `k` and `d` in the `dp` table. If a state has been computed before, we can simply return the stored result.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Since the result can be very large, the solution uses a modulus operation with `1000000007` to keep the numbers manageable and to avoid overflow.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize DP Table

The `dp` table is initialized globally with all entries set to `0`. The size of the table is `1001 x 1001` because the maximum number of moves (`k`) is `1000` and the maximum distance (`d`) between the starting and target positions is also bounded by `1000`.

```cpp
int dp[1001][1001] = {};
int mod = 1000000007;
```

#### Step 2: Main Function

The main function `numberOfWays` is called with `start`, `end`, and `k` as input parameters. It computes the absolute difference between the start and end positions (`d = abs(start - end)`) and calls the `dfs` (depth-first search) function to compute the result.

```cpp
int numberOfWays(int start, int end, int k) {
    return dfs(k, abs(start - end));
}
```

#### Step 3: Depth-First Search (DFS) with Memoization

The `dfs` function performs the recursive computation. It takes two parameters:
- `k`: The number of remaining moves.
- `d`: The current distance between the `start` and `end` positions.

The function first checks if the current distance is greater than or equal to the remaining moves (`d >= k`). If it is, the function checks whether `d == k`. If the distance equals `k`, it returns `1`, indicating a valid path. Otherwise, it returns `0`.

```cpp
if (d >= k) return d == k;
```

If the state `(k, d)` has already been computed (i.e., `dp[k][d] > 0`), the function returns the stored value from the `dp` table.

```cpp
if(dp[k][d] == 0)
```

If the value is not already computed, we recursively calculate the result by considering three possibilities:
1. We can increase the distance by 1 (`dfs(k - 1, d + 1)`).
2. We can decrease the distance by 1 (`dfs(k - 1, abs(d - 1))`).
3. We can keep the distance unchanged (`dfs(k - 1, d)`).

The result is the sum of these three possibilities, plus 1 to account for the current move.

```cpp
dp[k][d] = (1 + dfs(k-1, d + 1) + dfs(k - 1, abs(d - 1))) % mod;
```

Finally, the function returns `dp[k][d] - 1` because we started with an initial move that doesn't count in the recursive calculations.

```cpp
return dp[k][d] - 1;
```

#### Step 4: Return the Result

After all recursive calls and memoization, the result is stored in `dp[k][d]`, and we return the number of ways to reach the target position in exactly `k` moves.

```cpp
return dp[k][d] - 1;
```

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity

- The function `dfs` is called recursively, and for each state `(k, d)`, we are computing the result at most once due to memoization.
- The `dp` table has `1001 x 1001` entries, and each entry is computed once.
- The overall time complexity is therefore **O(k * d)**, where `k` is the number of moves and `d` is the maximum possible distance between `start` and `end`.

#### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is determined by the size of the `dp` table, which is **O(k * d)**. Given that the maximum values of `k` and `d` are both `1000`, the space complexity is **O(1001 * 1001)**.

### Conclusion

This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of ways to reach a target position from a starting position in exactly `k` moves. The approach involves memoization to avoid redundant calculations, and the modular arithmetic ensures the result remains within the bounds of standard data types. The time and space complexities are manageable, making this solution suitable for large inputs.

Key Takeaways:
- The problem is solved using a recursive approach with memoization to track the number of ways to reach the target position.
- The use of dynamic programming ensures that subproblems are solved only once, improving efficiency.
- The modular arithmetic ensures that the result remains within bounds and prevents overflow.
