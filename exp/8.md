### Problem Statement
Implement the function `myAtoi` that converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer. The function should handle leading whitespace, optional signs, and reject invalid characters while adhering to the constraints of a 32-bit signed integer.

### Approach
Parse the string character by character, handling optional leading spaces, a sign, and numeric digits. Ensure the final result does not exceed the bounds of a 32-bit signed integer.

### Code Walk-through
1. Initialize `res` to 0 for the result, `sgn` to 1 for the sign (positive by default), and `i` to 0 for the index.
2. Skip leading whitespace:
   - Use a while loop to increment `i` while the current character is a space.
3. Check for a sign:
   - If the next character is either '+' or '-', set `sgn` accordingly and increment `i`.
4. Parse numeric digits:
   - Use a while loop to continue as long as the current character is a digit (`'0'` to `'9'`):
     - Before updating `res`, check for overflow conditions:
       - If `res` is greater than `INT_MAX/10`, return the respective boundary (either `INT_MAX` or `INT_MIN`).
       - If `res` is equal to `INT_MAX/10`, check if the next digit exceeds the allowable range.
     - Update `res` by multiplying it by 10 and adding the integer value of the current digit.
5. Return the final result, multiplied by the sign.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) - where \(n\) is the length of the input string, since each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) - no additional space is used beyond a few variables.
