### üí° **myAtoi: Convert String to Integer**

The **`myAtoi`** problem asks us to implement a function that converts a string representing a valid integer into an actual integer. The string may contain leading spaces, an optional sign (`+` or `-`), and numeric characters. If the string is invalid or cannot be parsed into an integer, we return `0`.

Additionally, we must consider edge cases:
- **Overflowing or underflowing** the 32-bit signed integer range (`[-2147483648, 2147483647]`).
- Ignoring **non-numeric characters** after the valid numeric portion.

### üìå **Example**

- **Input**: `"42"`  
  **Output**: `42`
  
- **Input**: `"   -42"`  
  **Output**: `-42`
  
- **Input**: `"4193 with words"`  
  **Output**: `4193`
  
- **Input**: `"words and 987"`  
  **Output**: `0`
  
- **Input**: `"-91283472332"`  
  **Output**: `-2147483648` (since it overflows)

### üõ†Ô∏è **Approach: Parsing the String**

The algorithm can be broken down into several key steps:
1. **Skip Leading Whitespaces**: Start by skipping any leading spaces in the input string.
2. **Check for an Optional Sign**: Look for an optional `+` or `-` sign to determine the number's sign.
3. **Convert String to Integer**: Process the string, converting digits into an integer.
4. **Overflow and Underflow Checks**: During the conversion, check for potential overflow or underflow scenarios.
5. **Return the Final Result**: Finally, return the result, adjusting for the sign.

By processing the string one character at a time, we gradually build the integer, ensuring we handle all edge cases efficiently.

### **Code Breakdown (Step-by-Step)**

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

```cpp
int res = 0;
int sgn = 1;
int i = 0;
```

- `res`: Holds the result, initialized to `0`.
- `sgn`: Stores the sign of the number, initialized to `1` (positive).
- `i`: An index to traverse through the string, initialized to `0`.

#### Step 2: Skip Leading Whitespaces

```cpp
while(i < s.size() && s[i] == ' ') i++;
```

- This loop skips all leading spaces so we can start processing the number immediately.

#### Step 3: Handle Optional Sign

```cpp
if(i < s.size() && (s[i] == '+' || s[i] == '-'))
    sgn = (s[i++] == '+') ? 1 : -1;
```

- If we encounter a `+` or `-`, we adjust the sign (`sgn`) accordingly. We also increment `i` to move past the sign.

#### Step 4: Convert the String to Integer

```cpp
while(i < s.size() && s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9') {
    if(res > INT_MAX / 10 || (res == INT_MAX / 10 && ((s[i] - '0') > (INT_MAX % 10))))
        return (sgn > 0) ? INT_MAX : INT_MIN;
        
    res = res * 10 + (s[i++] - '0');
}
```

- We loop through each character of the string, processing it if it's a digit (`'0'` to `'9'`).
- **Overflow Check**: Before updating the result, we check whether multiplying `res` by `10` and adding the new digit would cause an overflow. If it does, we return `INT_MAX` or `INT_MIN`, depending on the sign.

#### Step 5: Return the Final Result

```cpp
return sgn * res;
```

- Finally, we return the result adjusted for the sign (`sgn`). If the sign was negative, the result will be negative.

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Complexity Analysis**

#### Time Complexity: **O(n)**
- The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. We process each character exactly once.

#### Space Complexity: **O(1)**
- The space complexity is **O(1)** because we only use a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.

### üöÄ **Conclusion**

The `myAtoi` solution efficiently handles the conversion of a string into an integer by following a step-by-step approach:
- **Trimming leading spaces**.
- **Handling the sign**.
- **Converting digits** to an integer, while ensuring no overflow or underflow occurs.
- Returning the result **adjusted for the sign**.

By using simple arithmetic and overflow checks, we ensure that the result stays within the bounds of a 32-bit signed integer. If the input is invalid, we return `0`, providing a clean solution for this problem.
