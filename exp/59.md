### Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `n`, generate an `n x n` matrix filled with elements from `1` to `n^2` in a spiral order.

### Approach
1. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - Create an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros.

2. **Define Boundaries**:
   - Use four variables to define the boundaries of the matrix:
     - `cBgn` (column beginning)
     - `cEnd` (column end)
     - `rBgn` (row beginning)
     - `rEnd` (row end)

3. **Filling the Matrix**:
   - Start with a number `num` initialized to `1`.
   - Use a loop to fill the matrix in a spiral manner until all boundaries are exhausted:
     - Fill from left to right along the top row.
     - Fill from top to bottom along the right column.
     - Fill from right to left along the bottom row (if still within bounds).
     - Fill from bottom to top along the left column (if still within bounds).
   - After filling each side, update the corresponding boundary to narrow the area for the next iteration.

4. **Return the Matrix**:
   - Once the matrix is completely filled, return it.

### Code Walk-through
- **Initialization**: The matrix is created and the boundaries are set.
- **Spiral Filling**: The while loop continues until all boundaries meet:
  - Each side of the square is filled, incrementing `num` appropriately.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \) since every cell in the matrix is filled once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \) for the matrix itself.
