### Problem Statement
Given a `m x n` matrix where each of its rows is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `k`, find the `k`th smallest element in the matrix.

### Approach
1. **Min-Heap (Priority Queue)**:
   - Use a min-heap (priority queue) to efficiently extract the smallest elements from the matrix.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - Insert the first element of each row (up to the smaller of `m` or `k`) into the min-heap. Each entry in the heap will store a vector containing the value, the row index, and the column index.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - Extract the smallest element from the heap `k-1` times. For each extracted element, if the next element in the same row exists (i.e., within bounds), push that next element into the heap.

4. **Final Extraction**:
   - After `k-1` extractions, the next top element in the heap will be the `k`th smallest element.

### Code Walk-through
- The `kthSmallest` function initializes the min-heap and pushes the first element of each row into it.
- A loop runs `k-1` times, extracting the smallest element each time and pushing the next element from the same row into the heap.
- Finally, the `k`th smallest element is obtained by peeking the top of the heap after the loop.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(k \log \min(m, k)) \), where \( m \) is the number of rows. Each insertion and extraction operation from the heap takes \( O(\log \text{size}) \).
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(\min(m, k)) \) for the heap storage.
