### Problem Statement
Implement a solution that allows randomly selecting a node's value from a singly linked list with equal probability. The class `Solution` should provide a method `getRandom()` that returns a random node's value from the linked list.

### Approach
To achieve uniform random selection from a linked list, we will use the **Reservoir Sampling** technique, which allows us to randomly select an item from a stream of unknown size.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The `Solution` class is initialized with the head of the linked list.

2. **Random Selection**:
   - Use a loop to traverse through the linked list.
   - For each node encountered, use `rand() % i` to decide whether to replace the current random value:
     - If the generated number is `0`, replace the stored value with the current node's value.
     - Increment the index `i` at each step to keep track of the number of nodes processed.
   - This ensures that each value has an equal probability of being selected.

### Code Walk-through
- The `Solution` class contains:
  - A pointer to the head of the linked list.
  - The `getRandom()` method, which implements reservoir sampling.
  
### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, since we must traverse the entire list to ensure uniform randomness.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of space for variables, regardless of the input size.
