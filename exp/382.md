### Problem Statement

In this problem, we are given a **singly linked list** with a series of node values. Our task is to implement a `Solution` class that has a method `getRandom()` that returns a random node's value from the linked list with **equal probability** for each node. The linked list has an arbitrary number of nodes, and our solution should efficiently select a random value without using extra space proportional to the size of the list.

### Approach

To solve the problem, we need to pick a random node from the linked list in such a way that each node has an equal chance of being selected. The approach we will use is based on **Reservoir Sampling** — a well-known algorithm that allows us to sample random elements from a stream or a list with **uniform probability** without needing to know the total size of the list upfront. The basic idea is to traverse the list once, maintaining a running random selection, and adjusting the chances of selecting each node as we go.

Here's how we will apply this approach to the problem:

1. **Traverse the List**: We will traverse the list, node by node.
2. **Maintain a Random Value**: At each node, we have a probability of 1/i (where i is the current node's position) of replacing the current value with the value at the node.
3. **End of List**: Once we reach the end of the list, we will have one random value, which will be returned.

This technique ensures that each node has the same probability of being selected, making the algorithm **O(n)** in time complexity, where n is the length of the list. The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are only maintaining a few variables.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Definition of ListNode
```cpp
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};
```
- The `ListNode` structure is defined as per the problem. Each node has a value (`val`) and a pointer to the next node (`next`).
- The constructor `ListNode()` initializes a node with a default value of 0 and a `nullptr` next pointer.
- The constructor `ListNode(int x)` initializes a node with a given value `x` and a `nullptr` next pointer.
- The constructor `ListNode(int x, ListNode* next)` initializes a node with value `x` and a specified next node.

#### Step 2: `Solution` Class and Constructor
```cpp
class Solution {
    ListNode* head;
public:
    Solution(ListNode* head) {
        this->head = head;
    }
```
- The `Solution` class is designed to hold a reference to the linked list’s head (`head`).
- The constructor `Solution(ListNode* head)` takes the head of the list and stores it in the class's private member `head`.

#### Step 3: `getRandom` Method
```cpp
    int getRandom() {
        int ans = 0, i = 1;
        ListNode* p = this->head;
        while(p) {
            if(rand() % i == 0) ans = p->val;
            i++;
            p = p->next;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
- **Random Selection Process**: 
    - `ans` is used to store the current random selection.
    - `i` keeps track of the position of the current node as we traverse the list.
    - We start with `i = 1`, indicating the first node in the list.
    - At each node, we generate a random number using `rand() % i`. This gives us a number between 0 and i-1. If the result is 0, we replace `ans` with the current node's value.
    - As we continue traversing the list, the probability of selecting any given node is adjusted by the formula 1/i, ensuring that each node has an equal chance of being selected.
- **End of Traversal**: After traversing all nodes, we return the value stored in `ans`, which will be the randomly selected node's value.

#### Step 4: Instantiation and Calling the `getRandom` Method
```cpp
/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution* obj = new Solution(head);
 * int param_1 = obj->getRandom();
 */
```
- The class is instantiated by passing the head of the linked list to the constructor.
- The `getRandom()` method is called to get a random node's value from the list. The method returns an integer, which is the value of the randomly selected node.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where n is the length of the linked list.
  - We traverse the linked list once, checking each node and updating the random value based on the current node's position. The time complexity is linear in terms of the number of nodes in the list.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**.
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space to store a few variables (`ans`, `i`, `p`), regardless of the size of the linked list.

### Conclusion

This solution leverages **Reservoir Sampling** to select a random node from a singly linked list with **uniform probability**. It ensures that the random selection process is efficient, with both time and space complexities that are optimal for this problem.

- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, as we traverse each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**, since we only use a few variables to store the state during traversal.

By using the `rand() % i == 0` condition, the algorithm ensures that each node has an equal chance of being selected. This makes the solution both space-efficient and time-efficient, making it ideal for large linked lists where traditional approaches (such as storing the list in an array) would be less efficient.
