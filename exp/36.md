### Problem Statement

The problem requires checking whether a given **9x9 Sudoku board** is valid. The board consists of digits (1-9) and empty cells represented by a period (`.`). A valid Sudoku board adheres to the following rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (also known as "boxes") must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

The task is to return `true` if the given board is valid, and `false` otherwise.

### Approach

To check if the given Sudoku board is valid, the solution uses a **hash map** (`map<string, bool>`) to keep track of the digits and their positions in rows, columns, and subgrids. The idea is to iterate over the entire board and validate the placement of each non-empty cell.

#### Key Observations:
1. A **row** is valid if no digit is repeated in that row.
2. A **column** is valid if no digit is repeated in that column.
3. A **subgrid (3x3 box)** is valid if no digit is repeated in that subgrid.

We will use a hash map to track whether any number has appeared in:
- The current row (represented by `(i, digit)`).
- The current column (represented by `(digit, j)`).
- The current 3x3 subgrid (represented by `(x, digit, y)`, where `x` and `y` are the indices of the subgrid).

The solution will:
- Traverse each element of the board.
- For each non-empty element, check if it violates the Sudoku rules by checking if it exists in the corresponding row, column, or subgrid using the hash map.
- If any violation is found, return `false`. If no violations are found after traversing the board, return `true`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
map<string, bool> ma;
```
- **Step 1:** We create a map `ma` where the key is a **string** that represents a combination of row, column, or subgrid information, and the value is a **boolean** indicating whether the combination has been encountered before. This will help in detecting duplicates.

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < 9; i++)
    for(int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
        if(board[i][j] != '.') {
```
- **Step 2:** We loop through the entire board with two nested `for` loops. The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the columns. For each element, we check if it is not an empty cell (`.`).

```cpp
string key = "(";
key += board[i][j];
key += ")";
if(ma.count(to_string(i) + key)) return false;
else ma[to_string(i) + key] = true;
```
- **Step 3:** If the current cell is not empty, we construct a **key** that uniquely identifies the digit in the current row. The key is in the format of `"(digit)"`. We then check if this key already exists in the map for the current row (i.e., `to_string(i) + key`). If it exists, we return `false`, indicating a violation (duplicate digit in the row). If it does not exist, we add the key to the map, marking it as visited.

```cpp
if(ma.count(key + to_string(j))) return false;
else ma[key + to_string(j)] = true;
```
- **Step 4:** We repeat the same process for the column. The key is formed by appending the column index (`to_string(j)`) to the `key` representing the digit. If a duplicate is found in the column, we return `false`. Otherwise, we add the key to the map.

```cpp
int x = i / 3, y = j / 3;
if(ma.count(to_string(x) + key + to_string(y))) return false;
else ma[to_string(x) + key + to_string(y)] = true;
```
- **Step 5:** Next, we check if the digit is repeated in the corresponding **3x3 subgrid**. The 3x3 subgrid can be identified by dividing the row index `i` and column index `j` by 3, which gives the **subgrid coordinates** `x` and `y`. We form a key by appending `x`, `key`, and `y`, and check the map for duplicates. If a duplicate is found, we return `false`. If no duplicate is found, we mark this subgrid as visited in the map.

```cpp
return true;
```
- **Step 6:** If no violations were found after checking all rows, columns, and subgrids, we return `true`, indicating that the Sudoku board is valid.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(1):** The time complexity is constant because we are always processing a 9x9 board, and the number of iterations does not depend on the size of the input. Each iteration processes a fixed number of cells (81 cells), and each operation (checking and inserting into the map) takes constant time. Therefore, the time complexity is **O(1)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** The space complexity is also constant because the size of the map is limited to a fixed number of keys. The maximum number of keys in the map is **81** (for each cell) times **3** (for row, column, and subgrid), which is still constant. Hence, the space complexity is **O(1)**.

### Conclusion

The `isValidSudoku` function efficiently checks whether a given 9x9 Sudoku board is valid by using a map to track the occurrence of digits in rows, columns, and subgrids. The algorithm operates in **constant time** and uses **constant space** due to the fixed size of the board. The solution is both efficient and scalable for the problem at hand. It guarantees that all the Sudoku constraints are checked and ensures that the solution is optimal for any valid 9x9 Sudoku grid.
