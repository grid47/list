### Problem Statement
Determine if a given 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells (containing digits 1-9) need to be validated according to the following rules:
1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

### Approach
1. **Hash Maps for Tracking**:
   - Use a map to track the occurrences of each number in rows, columns, and sub-boxes.

2. **Iterate Through the Board**:
   - For each cell in the board:
     - If the cell is not empty (`'.'`), perform the following:
       - Create a unique key for the row, column, and sub-box that the number belongs to.
       - Check if this key has already been encountered. If so, return `false` (indicating a duplicate).
       - If not, record the occurrence of the number.

3. **Return True**:
   - If no duplicates are found after checking all cells, return `true`, indicating the board is valid.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: Create a map `ma` to store the keys for tracking occurrences.
2. **Nested Loops**: Iterate through each row `i` and column `j` of the board.
3. **Key Construction**: Construct keys for the row, column, and 3x3 sub-box based on the current number.
4. **Duplicate Checking**: Use the map to check for duplicates and record the occurrences.
5. **Final Check**: If the loops complete without returning false, return true.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(1)\) since the board size is constant (9x9).
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) for the map storing limited keys (only 27 possible keys: 9 for rows, 9 for columns, and 9 for sub-boxes).
