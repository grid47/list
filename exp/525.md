### Problem Statement
Given a binary array `nums`, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray that contains an equal number of 0s and 1s.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use a variable `score` to keep track of the difference between the count of 1s and 0s (1 for each 1 and -1 for each 0).
   - Use a variable `res` to store the maximum length found.
   - Use a hashmap `mp` to store the first occurrence of each score.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - For each element in `nums`, update `score`:
     - Increment `score` by 1 if the element is 1.
     - Decrement `score` by 1 if the element is 0.

3. **Check for Equal Count**:
   - If `score` is 0, it means the subarray from the start to the current index has equal numbers of 0s and 1s, so update `res`.
   - If `score` has been seen before in the hashmap, calculate the length of the subarray between its first occurrence and the current index, updating `res` if this length is greater.
   - If `score` has not been seen before, store its index in the hashmap.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all elements in `nums`, return the maximum length stored in `res`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with `score = 0`, `res = 0`, and an empty hashmap `mp`.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - Loop through the array and update `score` based on the current element.
   - Use the hashmap to check for previously encountered scores and compute potential subarray lengths.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array, as we make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the hashmap storing the indices of scores.
