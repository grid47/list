### Problem Statement
You are given the root of a binary tree. Your task is to find the maximum width of the tree. The width of one level is defined as the length between the two furthest non-null nodes in that level. This is the number of nodes present in that level from the leftmost to the rightmost non-null nodes.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Use a queue to perform a level order traversal of the tree. Each element in the queue is a pair containing a pointer to the `TreeNode` and its corresponding index.
   - Keep a variable `width` to store the maximum width encountered.

2. **Level Order Traversal**:
   - Start by pushing the root node into the queue with index 0.
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Record the indices of the first and last nodes at the current level.
     - For each node at the current level:
       - Calculate the adjusted index based on the first node's index to avoid overflow.
       - Push the left child with index `2 * idx + 1` and the right child with index `2 * idx + 2` into the queue if they exist.
     - Update the maximum width by comparing the current width with the difference between the last and first indices plus one.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing all levels of the tree, return the maximum width found.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: The queue is initialized with the root node and index 0.
2. **Traversal Loop**: The while loop processes each level of the tree:
   - The first and last indices of the current level are determined.
   - Each node is popped from the queue, and its children are added with their respective indices.
3. **Width Calculation**: The maximum width is updated after each level based on the indices of the first and last nodes.
4. **Return Statement**: The final maximum width is returned.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree at any level, due to the storage of nodes in the queue during the traversal.
