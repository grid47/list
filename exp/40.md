### Problem Statement
The task is to find all unique combinations of candidate numbers that sum up to a specified target. Each candidate number can be used only once in a combination, and the solution must avoid duplicate combinations.

### Approach
1. **Backtracking**: This approach involves exploring all possible combinations recursively while keeping track of the current sum.
2. **Sorting**: The input list is sorted to easily skip duplicates during the combination generation.
3. **Base Cases**:
   - If the remaining sum equals zero, add the current combination to the result.
   - If the remaining sum becomes negative or the index exceeds the bounds of the list, terminate that path.
4. **Iterating through Candidates**:
   - Use a loop to iterate through the candidates, starting from the current index.
   - Skip duplicate candidates to prevent generating the same combination.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: The `combinationSum2` function initializes the answer vector, temporary storage vector, and sorts the candidate numbers.
2. **Backtracking Function (`bt`)**:
   - If the target sum is achieved (zero), store the current combination.
   - If the sum is negative or the end of the candidate list is reached, exit the function.
   - Loop through the candidates starting from the current index:
     - Skip duplicates to ensure unique combinations.
     - Include the current candidate in the temporary combination and recurse with the updated sum and index.
     - Remove the last candidate to backtrack and try other combinations.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The complexity is exponential, \(O(2^{\text{n}})\), due to the potential combinations being generated.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(\text{n})\) for the recursion stack and storage of combinations.
