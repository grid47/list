### Problem Statement
Given `n` functions with unique IDs and a list of logs indicating when each function starts and stops, compute the exclusive time for each function. The exclusive time of a function is the total time spent in that function, excluding the time spent in any child functions.

### Approach
1. **Data Structure**:
   - Use a `Log` struct to hold the function ID, status (start or end), and the timestamp.
   - Use a vector `ans` to store the exclusive time for each function.
   - Use a stack to keep track of the active function logs.

2. **Parsing Logs**:
   - For each log entry, split the string using the delimiter `:` to extract the function ID, status, and time.
   - Create a `Log` object for each log entry.

3. **Processing Logs**:
   - If the log indicates a "start" event:
     - Push the log onto the stack.
   - If the log indicates an "end" event:
     - Calculate the time spent in the function using the difference between the end time and the start time (considering inclusive counts).
     - Add this time to the exclusive time of the current function.
     - Pop the function from the stack.
     - If there is still a function in the stack (indicating a parent function), subtract the calculated time from the parent function's exclusive time.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all logs, return the `ans` vector containing the exclusive times for each function.

### Code Walk-through
1. Initialize a vector `ans` of size `n` to zero.
2. Iterate through each log entry, parsing and processing it based on the function status.
3. Use assertions to ensure that the function IDs match appropriately when popping from the stack.
4. Return the `ans` vector as the final result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(L), where L is the number of log entries, since each log is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the results and the stack in the worst case (when all functions are active).
