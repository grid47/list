### Problem Statement

The task is to determine the highest altitude reached after a series of changes in altitude, given an array of integers that represent the gain in altitude at each step. The altitude can increase or decrease based on the values in the array. The goal is to find the maximum altitude achieved throughout the journey.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a simple iterative approach. We will maintain a current altitude variable that starts at zero and update it based on the gains provided in the input array. We will also keep track of the maximum altitude reached during this process.

1. **Initialize Variables**: Start with a variable to track the current altitude (`cur`) initialized to zero, and another variable to track the maximum altitude (`mx`) initialized to zero.

2. **Iterate Through Gains**: Loop through each element in the `gain` array, updating the current altitude by adding the gain for each step.

3. **Update Maximum Altitude**: After updating the current altitude for each step, check if it exceeds the recorded maximum altitude and update if necessary.

4. **Return the Maximum**: After processing all the gains, return the maximum altitude recorded.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

The implementation follows these steps systematically:

1. **Class Definition**: The solution is encapsulated within a class named `Solution`.

   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   ```

2. **Public Method**: The method `largestAltitude` takes a vector of integers, `gain`, as input and returns an integer representing the highest altitude reached.

   ```cpp
   public:
       int largestAltitude(vector<int>& gain) {
   ```

3. **Variable Initialization**: Two variables are initialized:
   - `mx` to track the maximum altitude, starting at zero.
   - `cur` to track the current altitude, also starting at zero.

   ```cpp
   int mx = 0; 
   int cur = 0;
   ```

4. **Iterate Through Gain Array**: We loop through each element in the `gain` array. For each gain, we update the current altitude and check if it is the maximum.

   ```cpp
   for(int x: gain) {
       cur += x; // Update current altitude by adding the gain
       mx = max(mx, cur); // Update maximum altitude if current is higher
   }
   ```

   - In this loop:
     - `cur += x;` adds the current gain to the current altitude.
     - `mx = max(mx, cur);` checks if the updated current altitude exceeds the recorded maximum altitude, updating `mx` if it does.

5. **Return Result**: After the loop, return the maximum altitude recorded.

   ```cpp
   return mx;
   }
   ```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `gain` array. We iterate through the array once, performing constant-time operations at each step.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we are using a constant amount of space to store the current altitude and maximum altitude, regardless of the input size.

### Conclusion

In summary, the provided solution efficiently calculates the maximum altitude reached after a series of altitude changes represented by an array of gains. By maintaining a running total of the current altitude and updating the maximum altitude as we process each gain, we can achieve the result in a single pass through the input.

This straightforward approach is optimal for the problem and illustrates the use of basic iterative techniques in handling arrays. The implementation is both clear and effective, making it an excellent choice for determining the highest point in a sequence of altitude changes. This method can be applied to similar problems where cumulative effects need to be tracked over a series of steps, highlighting the versatility of the algorithm in real-world scenarios such as flight altitude changes, elevation gains in hiking, or any context where altitude adjustments are relevant. Overall, this solution is efficient, easy to understand, and well-suited for competitive programming and algorithm challenges.
