### Problem Statement
Given a string representing a chemical formula, count the number of atoms of each element in the formula. The formula may include parentheses and subscripts to indicate multiples.

### Approach
1. **Parsing the Formula**:
   - Use a recursive approach to parse the chemical formula string.
   - Identify elements, their counts, and handle nested structures within parentheses.

2. **Helper Functions**:
   - **`atom(string &eqn, int &i)`**:
     - Extracts the name of an atom (element) starting from index `i`.
   - **`num(string &eqn, int &i)`**:
     - Extracts the count of atoms (subscript) starting from index `i`. If no number is found, it returns `1`.
   - **`unit(string &eqn, int &i)`**:
     - Handles individual units of the formula. If the unit is a group (parentheses), it recursively parses it.
   - **`formula(string &eqn, int &i)`**:
     - Parses the entire formula, managing multiple units and their counts.

3. **Merging Counts**:
   - Use a helper function `merge(map<string, int> &to, map<string, int> &from, int mul)` to update the count of atoms based on the parsed results.

4. **Constructing the Result**:
   - After parsing the formula, construct the result string in alphabetical order of the elements, appending their counts.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function**:
  - `string countOfAtoms(string eqn)`: Main function that initializes parsing and constructs the final result string.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the input string, as we parse through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(M), where M is the number of unique elements in the formula, as we use a map to store the counts.
