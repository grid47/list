### Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit. Return that single digit.

### Approach
The solution uses an iterative approach to sum the digits of the number until a single-digit result is obtained:

1. **Inner Loop**: Extract the last digit using modulo operation and add it to the result `res`. Divide the number by 10 to remove the last digit.
2. **Outer Loop**: Continue this process until `num` becomes a single-digit number (less than or equal to 9).
3. **Return the Result**: Once `num` is a single digit, return it.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A non-negative integer `num`.
- **Output**: The single-digit result obtained by repeatedly adding the digits of `num`.

1. Initialize `res` to 0.
2. While `num` is greater than 9:
   - Reset `res` to 0 for each iteration.
   - Extract and sum each digit of `num` using a while loop.
   - Update `num` with the sum of digits stored in `res`.
3. Return `num`, which is now a single-digit number.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\log n)\) because the number of digits in `num` reduces in each iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) as no additional space is used other than a few variables.

### Edge Cases
1. **Single Digit**: If `num` is already a single digit, it is returned as is.
2. **Zero**: If `num` is `0`, it is also returned immediately.
