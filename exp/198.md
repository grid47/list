### Problem Statement
You are a professional robber who wants to maximize the amount of money you can rob tonight. Each house has a certain amount of money, and you cannot rob two adjacent houses. Given an integer array `a` representing the amount of money at each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the first `i + 1` houses.
   - The choice at each house is whether to rob it or skip it. If you rob the current house, you cannot rob the previous house.

2. **State Transition**:
   - Initialize:
     - `dp[0] = a[0]` (only one house to rob)
     - `dp[1] = max(a[0], a[1])` (choose the maximum between the first and second house)
   - For each house from the third onward, decide whether to rob the current house or skip it:
     - `dp[i] = max(dp[i-2] + a[i], dp[i-1])` (either rob the current house and add its value to the best amount from two houses back, or take the best amount from the previous house).

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the class `Solution`.
- **Line 2**: Define the `rob` function, which takes a vector `a` of integers.
- **Line 3**: Determine the number of houses `n`.
- **Line 4**: Handle the base case when there is only one house.
- **Line 5**: Initialize a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `n` with zeros.
- **Line 6**: Set the values for the first two houses.
- **Lines 7-9**: Iterate through the array from the third house onwards, updating the `dp` array based on the defined state transition.
- **Line 10**: Return the maximum amount that can be robbed from all houses (`dp[n-1]`).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of houses.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), due to the storage of the dynamic programming array. (Note: This can be optimized to \(O(1)\) using two variables instead of an array.)
