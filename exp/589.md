### Problem Statement
Given an N-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

### Approach
1. **Preorder Traversal**:
   - Preorder traversal visits the root node first, followed by recursively visiting each of the children from left to right.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Define a recursive helper function `pre` that takes a node as input:
     - If the node is `NULL`, return immediately.
     - Otherwise, append the node's value to the result list.
     - Iterate through the children of the node and call the `pre` function recursively on each child.

3. **Main Function**:
   - The main function `preorder` initializes the result list and calls the helper function on the root node.

### Code Walk-through
- The `Node` class is defined with an integer value and a vector of child nodes.
- The `pre` function performs the preorder traversal and fills the `ans` vector with node values.
- The `preorder` function serves as the entry point for the traversal.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree, for the recursion stack. The space used for the result list is O(N).
