### Problem Statement
In this problem, you are tasked with calculating the number of seats booked for a series of flights based on a list of booking requests. Each request includes:
- A start flight number.
- An end flight number.
- The number of seats booked for all flights in the specified range.

Given a list of such booking requests and the total number of flights, your objective is to determine how many seats are booked for each flight.

**Input:**
- An integer `m` representing the total number of flights.
- A list of bookings, where each booking is represented as a vector containing three integers:
  - The start flight number.
  - The end flight number.
  - The number of seats booked.

**Output:**
- A vector of integers, where each integer represents the total number of seats booked for the corresponding flight.

### Approach
To efficiently calculate the number of booked seats for each flight, we will use the "difference array" technique. This approach involves:
1. Initializing an array to keep track of seat changes at the beginning and just after the end of the booking range.
2. Iterating over the booking requests to update the seat counts at the specified start and end indices.
3. Using a prefix sum calculation to derive the total booked seats for each flight.

This method is optimal as it reduces the complexity of updating the seat counts from linear to constant time for each booking, followed by a linear pass to compute the final counts.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Class Definition**: The `Solution` class contains the method to compute the seat bookings.

   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
   ```

2. **Method Declaration**: The `corpFlightBookings` method is defined, which takes a vector of bookings and an integer `m` as input parameters.

   ```cpp
       vector<int> corpFlightBookings(vector<vector<int>>& bookings, int m) {
   ```

3. **Initialization**: An answer vector `ans` of size `m` is initialized to zero. This will hold the total booked seats for each flight.

   ```cpp
           vector<int> ans(m, 0);
   ```

4. **Updating Seat Changes**: The code iterates through each booking request, updating the `ans` vector:
   - Increase the booking count at the start index (adjusted to zero-based).
   - Decrease the booking count at the end index (if it is within bounds), indicating that the seats booked will stop affecting subsequent flights.

   ```cpp
           for(auto& v: bookings) {
               ans[v[0] - 1] += v[2];  // Increase the booking count for the start flight
               if(v[1] < m) ans[v[1]] -= v[2];  // Decrease for the flight just after the end flight
           }
   ```

5. **Calculating Prefix Sums**: After processing all bookings, the code calculates the prefix sum of the `ans` vector. This step converts the difference array into the actual counts of booked seats for each flight.

   ```cpp
           for(int j = 1; j < m; j++)
               ans[j] += ans[j - 1];  // Update counts by accumulating previous values
   ```

6. **Return Result**: Finally, the method returns the populated `ans` vector, which contains the total number of booked seats for each flight.

   ```cpp
           return ans;  // Return the final counts of booked seats
       }
   };
   ```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the algorithm is \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the number of booking requests and \(m\) is the number of flights. The first loop iterates through the bookings, and the second loop processes the prefix sums.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(m)\) due to the `ans` vector, which holds the booked seat counts for each flight.

### Conclusion
The provided C++ code efficiently computes the total number of booked seats for each flight using the difference array technique. By leveraging this method, the algorithm minimizes the number of operations required for updating seat counts based on booking ranges, leading to significant performance improvements.

In summary, this solution showcases a clever application of the difference array approach, providing an optimal way to handle range updates in competitive programming. This technique is particularly beneficial in scenarios where multiple updates to an array are needed, allowing for quick and efficient calculations.

This explanation serves as a comprehensive guide for readers interested in understanding both the algorithm and its implementation, making it valuable for those looking to enhance their skills in coding and algorithm design.
