### Problem Statement
Design a HashSet that supports the following operations:
1. `add(key)`: Inserts the value `key` into the HashSet.
2. `remove(key)`: Removes the value `key` from the HashSet.
3. `contains(key)`: Returns `true` if the value `key` exists in the HashSet, otherwise returns `false`.

### Approach
- **Data Structure**: Use an array of linked lists to handle collisions via chaining.
  - The array size is predefined (e.g., 10,000).
  - Each index of the array points to the head of a linked list containing values that hash to the same index.

- **Hash Function**: Use the modulo operation with the size of the array to determine the index for each key.

### Operations
1. **Add**:
   - Compute the index using `key % sz`.
   - If there is no list at that index, create a new list node.
   - Traverse the list to check for duplicates; if not found, add the new node at the end.

2. **Remove**:
   - Compute the index using `key % sz`.
   - If the list at that index is `NULL`, do nothing.
   - If the head node is the target, move the head pointer to the next node.
   - Traverse the list to find the target node and adjust the pointers to remove it.

3. **Contains**:
   - Compute the index using `key % sz`.
   - Traverse the linked list at that index, returning `true` if the key is found.

### Code Walk-through
- **ListNode Class**: Defines a basic linked list node with a value and a pointer to the next node.
- **MyHashSet Class**: 
  - Initializes a vector of `ListNode*` to serve as buckets for storing linked lists.
  - Implements the three main operations (`add`, `remove`, and `contains`) efficiently.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - `add`: O(1) on average; O(n) in the worst case (when all keys hash to the same index).
  - `remove`: O(1) on average; O(n) in the worst case.
  - `contains`: O(1) on average; O(n) in the worst case.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing elements in the hash set.
