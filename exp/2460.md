### Problem Statement:
In this problem, we are given an array `A` of integers. We need to apply a series of operations on this array with the goal of doubling the values of consecutive elements that are equal and setting the second element of the pair to zero. After performing the operations, all non-zero elements should be shifted to the left side of the array, while the zeros should be moved to the right side.

The task is to return the modified array after applying these operations.

### Approach:
The approach for solving this problem involves iterating through the array and performing two main actions for each element:
1. **Doubling Consecutive Equal Elements**: If two consecutive elements are equal, we double the first one and set the second element to zero.
2. **Shifting Non-Zero Elements**: After performing the doubling operation, we need to shift the non-zero elements to the left side and move the zeros to the right side of the array.

This needs to be done in a single pass through the array, and the goal is to maintain an efficient solution.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step):

Letâ€™s break down the code to understand the operations and logic:

1. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   vector<int> applyOperations(vector<int>& A) {
   ```
   The function `applyOperations` takes a reference to a vector `A` as input, which contains the integers that need to be processed. It returns a vector of integers that contains the result after applying the specified operations.

2. **Initial Setup of Variables**:
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < size(A); ++i){
   ```
   The loop iterates over each element in the array `A`. Two variables are used in the loop:
   - `i`: It represents the current index in the array while iterating.
   - `j`: It represents the index where the next non-zero element should be placed. Initially, `j` is set to 0.

3. **Doubling Consecutive Equal Elements**:
   ```cpp
   if (i + 1 < size(A) and A[i] == A[i + 1]){
       A[i] *= 2;
       A[i + 1] = 0;
   }
   ```
   Inside the loop, we check if the current element `A[i]` is equal to the next element `A[i + 1]`. If this condition is true, it means these two consecutive elements are equal and need to be merged:
   - `A[i] *= 2`: The first element of the pair is doubled.
   - `A[i + 1] = 0`: The second element of the pair is set to zero since it is merged with the first.

4. **Shifting Non-Zero Elements to the Left**:
   ```cpp
   if (A[i]) swap(A[j++], A[i]);
   ```
   After checking for consecutive equal elements and potentially performing the doubling operation, we now ensure that non-zero elements are moved to the left side:
   - `if (A[i])`: This condition checks if the current element is non-zero.
   - `swap(A[j++], A[i])`: If the element is non-zero, we swap it with the element at the `j`-th index, which is where the next non-zero element should be placed. After the swap, `j` is incremented to point to the next position for a non-zero element.

   By using the `swap` operation, we ensure that all non-zero elements are shifted to the left side while maintaining their order, and all zeros are moved to the right side.

5. **Return the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return A;
   ```
   After the loop finishes iterating through all elements, the function returns the modified array `A`, which contains the result of the operations.

### Complexity:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The loop runs for each element of the array `A`, iterating exactly once over the array. Each operation inside the loop (doubling elements, setting elements to zero, and swapping) takes constant time.
   - Hence, the time complexity of the algorithm is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The algorithm operates in-place, meaning no extra space is used other than the input array `A` and a couple of integer variables (`i` and `j`).
   - Therefore, the space complexity is \( O(1) \), as the space used does not grow with the size of the input.

### Conclusion:

The `applyOperations` function efficiently applies the specified operations to the array `A` in a single pass. It performs the following:
- Merges consecutive equal elements by doubling the first element and setting the second element to zero.
- Shifts non-zero elements to the left while moving zeros to the right.

This approach ensures that the array is processed in linear time, making it optimal for large arrays. The algorithm operates in-place with constant space complexity, making it memory efficient as well. The result is a modified array with the desired properties, where the non-zero elements are compacted to the left side, and the zeros are moved to the right side.
