### Problem Statement
Given the roots of two binary trees, `root` and `subRoot`, determine if `subRoot` is a subtree of `root`. A subtree of a tree is a tree that consists of a node in the tree and all of its descendants.

### Approach
1. **Tree Traversal**:
   - Use a recursive approach to traverse the main tree (`root`).
   - For each node in the main tree, check if it matches the root of the subtree (`subRoot`).

2. **Match Function**:
   - Create a helper function `match` that checks if two trees are identical:
     - If both nodes are `NULL`, they are identical.
     - If one is `NULL` and the other is not, they are not identical.
     - If both nodes are not `NULL`, compare their values and recursively check their left and right children.

3. **Recursive Checking**:
   - In the `isSubtree` function, if the current node matches the subtree, return `true`.
   - If it doesnâ€™t match, recursively check the left and right children of the current node.

### Code Walk-through
- The `isSubtree` function starts at the root and calls `match` to check for equality with `subRoot`.
- If they match, it returns `true`. If not, it continues searching in the left and right subtrees.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * M), where N is the number of nodes in `root` and M is the number of nodes in `subRoot`. In the worst case, every node of `root` needs to be compared with every node of `subRoot`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This accounts for the recursive call stack.
