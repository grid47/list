### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of unique pairs `(i, j)` such that `i` and `j` are both numbers in the array and their absolute difference is equal to `k`. The pair `(i, j)` is considered the same as `(j, i)` and should only be counted once.

### Approach
1. **Use a Hash Map**: Utilize a hash map to count the occurrences of each number in the array. This helps in quickly checking if the required pairs exist.
  
2. **Iterate Through the Map**: For each unique number in the map, check for two scenarios:
   - When `k > 0`: Check if `i - k` exists in the map. If it does, it forms a valid pair `(i, i-k)`.
   - When `k == 0`: Check if the count of the number `i` is greater than 1. This indicates that there are duplicates of `i`, allowing for the pair `(i, i)`.

3. **Count Unique Pairs**: Maintain a counter to track the number of unique pairs found.

### Code Walk-through
- Populate the map with counts of each number in `nums`.
- Loop through the entries of the map and apply the above conditions to count valid pairs.
- Finally, return the count of unique pairs.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`. We traverse the array to create the map and then iterate through the map.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), in the worst case, where all elements in `nums` are unique, resulting in storing all of them in the map.
