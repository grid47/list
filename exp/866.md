### Problem Statement
The task is to find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to a given integer \( n \). A prime palindrome is a number that is both prime and reads the same backward as forward.

### Approach
1. **Special Cases**:
   - If \( n \) is between 8 and 11 (inclusive), return 11 directly, since it is the smallest prime palindrome in that range.

2. **Generate Palindromes**:
   - Loop through integers \( x \) from 1 to 99,999.
   - Convert \( x \) to a string \( s \).
   - Create a palindrome \( y \) by appending \( s \) to its reverse (excluding the last character to avoid duplication).
   - This approach generates odd-length palindromes.
   - If the generated palindrome \( y \) is greater than or equal to \( n \), check if it is prime.

3. **Prime Check**:
   - Implement a helper function `isPrime` to check if a number is prime.
   - Handle edge cases where numbers less than 2 are not prime, and treat 2 separately.
   - Use trial division to check for factors only up to the square root of the number, incrementing by 2 to skip even numbers.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the first prime palindrome found that meets the conditions.

### Code Walk-through
- The `primePalindrome` function initializes the palindrome generation process and checks for primality.
- The `isPrime` function verifies if a number is prime using efficient methods.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(K * sqrt(M)), where \( K \) is the number of palindromes generated (approximately 100,000) and \( M \) is the largest palindrome checked for primality.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional data structures are required beyond a few variables.
