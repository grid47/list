### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` consisting of parentheses only, you need to calculate the **score** of the string. The score is calculated based on the following rules:
1. An empty string has a score of `0`.
2. `()` has a score of `1`.
3. For every additional pair of parentheses `(...)`, the score is doubled and the score of the inside is added:
   - For example, the score of `(())` is `2`, and the score of `(()())` is `2 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

### Approach
1. **Data Structure**: Use a stack to keep track of scores at different levels of parentheses.
2. **Iterate through the string**:
   - When encountering a `(`, push the current score onto the stack and reset the score to `0`.
   - When encountering a `)`, pop the last score from the stack and calculate the new score:
     - If the inner score is `0`, it means it was `()`, and we add `1`.
     - If the inner score is greater than `0`, we double it (for the nested parentheses) and add it to the popped score.
3. **Return the final score** after processing the entire string.

### Code Walk-through
- Initialize `scr` to `0` and create a stack to store intermediate scores.
- For each character in the string:
  - On encountering `(`, push the current score to the stack.
  - On encountering `)`, calculate the new score based on the popped score and the current score.
- Return the final score once the loop is complete.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We iterate through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, for the stack storing intermediate scores.
