### Problem Statement
Given a string, find the index of the first non-repeating character in it. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

### Approach
1. **Count Character Frequencies**:
   - Use a hash map (or unordered map) to store the frequency of each character in the string.

2. **Identify First Unique Character**:
   - Iterate through the string a second time to check the frequency of each character. The first character with a frequency of 1 is the first non-repeating character.

3. **Return Index**:
   - If found, return the index of this character; otherwise, return -1.

### Code Walk-through
- The function `firstUniqChar` first populates the map with character counts.
- It then checks each character in the string against the map. The first character with a count of 1 is returned as the result.
- If no unique character is found by the end of the iteration, the function returns -1.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string twice: once for counting and once for checking uniqueness.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the size of the map is limited to the number of unique characters (at most 26 for lowercase letters).
