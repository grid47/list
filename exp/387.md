### 🚀 Problem Statement

We need to find the **first unique character** in a given string `s`. A character is considered unique if it appears exactly once in the string. If there's no unique character, we return `-1`.

For example, for the input string `s = "leetcode"`, the output should be `0` because the first unique character is `'l'`, which is at index `0`.

### 🧠 Approach

To solve this problem, we’ll use a **two-pass approach**:

1. **Count the frequency** of each character in the string.
2. **Iterate again** to find the first character with a frequency of `1`.

The solution uses a **map** (or hash map) to store character frequencies, which allows us to efficiently count occurrences and find the first unique character in linear time.

Here’s how the solution works step by step:

- In the **first pass**, count how many times each character appears.
- In the **second pass**, go through the string and check the frequency of each character. The first character with a count of `1` is returned.

### 🔨 Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Here’s the code that implements this solution:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int firstUniqChar(string s) {
        
        map<char, int> mp;
        for(char x: s) mp[x]++;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++)
            if(mp[s[i]] == 1) return i;
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```

#### 1. **Class Declaration**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int firstUniqChar(string s) {
```
- We define the `Solution` class with a public method `firstUniqChar` that takes a string `s` as input.

#### 2. **Count Character Occurrences**
```cpp
map<char, int> mp;
for(char x: s) mp[x]++;
```
- A `map<char, int>` named `mp` is used to store the frequency of each character in the string `s`. 
- We loop through the string and update the map with the frequency of each character.

#### 3. **Find the First Unique Character**
```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++)
    if(mp[s[i]] == 1) return i;
```
- We loop through the string again. For each character, we check if its frequency is `1` in the map. 
- If we find such a character, we immediately return its index.

#### 4. **Handle No Unique Character**
```cpp
return -1;
```
- If no unique character is found, we return `-1`, indicating that there is no unique character in the string.

### 📈 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
  - The first loop takes **O(n)** time to count character occurrences.
  - The second loop also takes **O(n)** time to find the first unique character.
  - Hence, the total time complexity is **O(n)**, making this an efficient solution for large strings.
  
- **Space Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of unique characters in the string.
  - The space is used by the map `mp` to store character frequencies. In the worst case, every character could be unique, requiring **O(n)** space.

### 🏁 Conclusion

This solution efficiently solves the problem of finding the **first unique character** in a string using a **two-pass approach** with a map:

1. **First pass**: Count the occurrences of each character.
2. **Second pass**: Find the first character with a frequency of `1`.

With a time complexity of **O(n)** and a space complexity of **O(n)**, this solution is both time and space-efficient. It is optimal for handling strings of varying sizes while maintaining clarity and simplicity.

### 🎯 Key Takeaways:
- The **two-pass approach** ensures we efficiently process the string.
- Using a **map** allows us to count character frequencies and quickly find the first unique character.
- This solution is fast and works well for both small and large inputs.

Keep up the great work, and keep coding! 💪
