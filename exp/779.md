### Problem Statement
You are tasked with generating a sequence of 0s and 1s based on a set of rules, starting with "0". Each subsequent row is formed by reading the previous row and replacing each digit according to the following rules:
- If the digit is `0`, the next row will have `01`.
- If the digit is `1`, the next row will have `10`.
Given an integer `n`, the function should return the `k`-th digit of the `n`-th row of this sequence.

### Approach
1. **Recursive Logic**:
   - Base Case: If `n` is `1`, the result is `0`.
   - Determine if the `k`-th position is even or odd:
     - If `k` is even, find the value at position `k/2` in the previous row and invert it.
     - If `k` is odd, find the value at position `(k+1)/2` in the previous row and keep it the same.

### Code Walk-through
- **Method**:
  - `int kthGrammar(int n, int k)`: Recursively determines the value of the `k`-th digit in the `n`-th row of the grammar sequence.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), since the recursion can go up to `n` levels.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the recursion stack space.
