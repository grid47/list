### Problem Statement

We are given two arrays: `q` and `wage`, representing the quality and wage of `n` workers, respectively. We also have an integer `k` which denotes the number of workers we want to hire.

The goal is to hire exactly `k` workers such that the **cost** is minimized. The cost to hire `k` workers is calculated based on their qualities and wages as follows:

- For each worker, we are given their quality (`q[i]`) and wage (`wage[i]`).
- The wage of the workers can be chosen based on the worker with the minimum wage per unit quality (i.e., the lowest `wage[i] / q[i]` ratio).
- The total cost of hiring `k` workers will be calculated as:
  
  \[
  \text{Total Cost} = \left(\sum \text{qualities of k selected workers}\right) \times \text{minimum wage per unit quality of selected workers}
  \]

We need to find the minimum possible cost to hire exactly `k` workers.

### Approach

To minimize the cost of hiring exactly `k` workers, the following steps are performed:

1. **Understanding the Cost Formula**:
   - The cost to hire workers is minimized when the ratio of wage to quality (`wage[i] / quality[i]`) is minimized. This is because the wage per unit quality is multiplied by the total quality of the workers we hire.

2. **Sorting Workers**:
   - First, we calculate the `wage[i] / quality[i]` ratio for each worker and store them as pairs in a vector. The pairs consist of the ratio followed by the quality of the worker.
   - We then sort the workers based on this ratio. The reason for this is that workers with a lower wage-to-quality ratio are more cost-efficient, so we want to prioritize them.

3. **Using a Priority Queue**:
   - After sorting, we will use a priority queue (max-heap) to maintain the `k` workers with the lowest qualities.
   - For each group of `k` workers, we calculate the cost using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Cost} = \left(\text{Sum of qualities of the k workers}\right) \times \text{Wage per unit quality of the worker with the minimum ratio}
     \]
   - We compute this for every possible group of `k` workers (in terms of sorted order) and keep track of the minimum cost.

4. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - Initially, the first `k` workers are added to the priority queue, and the total quality of those workers is calculated.
   - For each new worker added, the one with the largest quality is removed (since we want to maintain exactly `k` workers).
   - After each change, we compute the cost for the current group of workers and update the minimum cost accordingly.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Create a Worker List

```cpp
vector<pair<double, int>> worker;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    worker.push_back({(double) wage[i] / q[i], q[i]});
}
```

- We create a vector `worker` to store pairs of `wage[i] / q[i]` and `q[i]` for each worker. The ratio `wage[i] / q[i]` represents the wage per unit quality for the worker, and `q[i]` is the quality of the worker.

#### Step 2: Sort Workers Based on the Ratio

```cpp
sort(worker.begin(), worker.end());
```

- We sort the workers in ascending order based on their `wage[i] / q[i]` ratio, as we want to prioritize workers with the lowest wage-to-quality ratios.

#### Step 3: Initialize Priority Queue and First Group of Workers

```cpp
priority_queue<int> pq;
int netq = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    pq.push(worker[i].second);
    netq += worker[i].second;
}
```

- We initialize a max-heap priority queue `pq` to keep track of the `k` workers with the lowest qualities.
- We also initialize `netq` to store the sum of the qualities of the first `k` workers.

#### Step 4: Calculate Initial Minimum Cost

```cpp
double mn = netq * worker[k - 1].first;
```

- The initial cost is calculated using the sum of the qualities of the first `k` workers multiplied by the wage-to-quality ratio of the worker at index `k-1` (since the workers are sorted by the ratio).

#### Step 5: Slide the Window and Update the Cost

```cpp
for(int i = k; i < n; i++) {
    netq -= pq.top();
    pq.pop();
    pq.push(worker[i].second);
    netq += worker[i].second;
    
    double res = netq * worker[i].first;
    mn = min(mn, res);
}
```

- For each new worker from index `k` onwards, we slide the window:
  - Remove the worker with the largest quality from the priority queue.
  - Add the new worker to the priority queue.
  - Update the total quality `netq` by adding the new worker’s quality and subtracting the removed worker’s quality.
  - Calculate the cost using the sum of qualities and the current worker’s ratio, then update the minimum cost `mn`.

#### Step 6: Return the Minimum Cost

```cpp
return mn;
```

- Finally, we return the minimum cost found.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:

- Sorting the workers based on the `wage[i] / q[i]` ratio takes **O(n log n)** time.
- For each worker (after the first `k` workers), we perform `O(log k)` operations on the priority queue (insertions and deletions). Thus, iterating through the remaining `n - k` workers takes **O((n - k) log k)** time.
- Overall, the time complexity is **O(n log n + (n - k) log k)**, which simplifies to **O(n log n)** since `n` dominates `k` in large inputs.

#### Space Complexity:

- We store the worker information in a vector, which requires **O(n)** space.
- The priority queue stores at most `k` workers at any time, requiring **O(k)** space.
- Overall, the space complexity is **O(n + k)**, which simplifies to **O(n)** since `k` is smaller than `n`.

### Conclusion

This solution effectively minimizes the total cost of hiring `k` workers by sorting the workers based on their wage-to-quality ratio and using a sliding window approach with a priority queue. By maintaining a group of `k` workers with the lowest qualities at each step, we can calculate the optimal cost efficiently. 

The time complexity of the solution is **O(n log n)**, which ensures it performs well even for large input sizes. The space complexity is **O(n)**, which is optimal for storing the worker information and priority queue. This approach provides an efficient and effective solution to the problem.
