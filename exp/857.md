### Problem Statement
You need to hire exactly `k` workers out of `n` available workers, where each worker has a specific quality and a wage that they demand. The goal is to minimize the cost of hiring these workers, which is calculated as follows:
- If you hire workers with qualities `q1, q2, ..., qk`, their total cost is:
  
  \[
  \text{Cost} = \frac{\text{Sum of Qualities}}{\text{Quality of Min Wage Worker}} \times \text{Min Wage}
  \]

### Approach
1. **Calculate Wage per Quality**: For each worker, compute the wage per unit quality and store the results in a vector of pairs, where each pair contains `(wage/quality, quality)`.
2. **Sort Workers**: Sort the workers based on their wage per unit quality.
3. **Use a Max-Heap**: Maintain a max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the `k` workers with the highest qualities among those selected.
4. **Calculate Minimum Cost**:
   - Initially, add the first `k` workers to the max-heap and calculate the initial total quality and cost.
   - For the remaining workers, update the heap by replacing the worker with the highest quality (if necessary) and recalculate the total quality and cost.
   - Update the minimum cost whenever a new worker is added.

### Code Walk-through
- Start by creating a vector to store pairs of `(wage/quality, quality)`.
- Sort this vector based on the wage-to-quality ratio.
- Initialize a max-heap and the total quality for the first `k` workers.
- As you iterate through the remaining workers, adjust the heap and calculate the cost to keep track of the minimum.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting and O(k log k) for maintaining the heap. Overall complexity is dominated by O(n log n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the workers and O(k) for the heap.
