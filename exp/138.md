### Problem Statement
Given a linked list where each node contains an additional random pointer that could point to any node in the list or `null`, create a deep copy of the list. Each node in the new list should have the same value and random pointers as the original list.

### Approach
1. **HashMap (or Map)**:
   - Use a map to keep track of the original nodes and their corresponding copies.
   - For each node, check if it has already been copied; if not, create a new node and store it in the map.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 3-8**: Define the `Node` structure with `val`, `next`, and `random` pointers.
- **Line 12**: Create a map named `mp` to store the mapping from original nodes to their copies.
- **Line 13**: Define the `copyRandomList` function that clears the map and starts the copy process.
- **Line 15**: Define the recursive `copy` function:
  - **Line 16**: If the current `head` is null, return null.
  - **Line 17**: If the node is already in the map, return the corresponding copy.
  - **Line 19**: Create a new node for the current node and store it in the map.
  - **Line 20**: Recursively copy the `next` and `random` pointers.
  - **Line 22**: Return the new node.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the list, as each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for storing the mapping in the hash map.
