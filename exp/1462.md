### Problem Statement

The problem requires us to determine if there exists a prerequisite relationship between courses based on a list of prerequisite pairs. We are given `num` courses (indexed from `0` to `num-1`) and a list of prerequisite pairs `pre`, where each pair `[a, b]` indicates that course `a` is a prerequisite for course `b`. Additionally, we are provided with a list of queries `q`, where each query asks if course `q[i][0]` is a prerequisite for course `q[i][1]`. The function should return a boolean vector indicating the answers to each query.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can utilize a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to build a reachability matrix that indicates whether one course is a prerequisite for another. Here’s how the solution is structured:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - We represent the prerequisite relationships using an adjacency list (a grid), where each index corresponds to a course, and the values at each index are the courses that depend on it.

2. **Reachability Matrix**:
   - We maintain a `reach` matrix where `reach[i][j]` is `true` if course `i` is a prerequisite for course `j`. This matrix is initialized to `false`.

3. **BFS for Reachability**:
   - For each course, we perform a BFS to determine all courses that can be reached starting from that course. During the BFS traversal, we mark reachable courses in the `reach` matrix.

4. **Answering Queries**:
   - After constructing the `reach` matrix, we can easily answer each query by checking the corresponding entry in the matrix.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here’s the detailed breakdown of the code implementation:

1. **Class Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
   ```

   - The solution is encapsulated in a class named `Solution`, which is typical in programming contests.

2. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   vector<bool> checkIfPrerequisite(int num, vector<vector<int>>& pre, vector<vector<int>>& q) {
   ```

   - This function takes the total number of courses `num`, a vector of prerequisite pairs `pre`, and a vector of queries `q`, and returns a vector of booleans.

3. **Matrix Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   vector<vector<bool>> reach(num, vector<bool>(num, false));
   vector<vector<int>> grid(num);
   ```

   - `reach`: A 2D vector initialized to `false`, representing the reachability between courses.
   - `grid`: An adjacency list representation of the graph where each index corresponds to a course and contains a list of courses that depend on it.

4. **Building the Graph**:
   ```cpp
   for(auto it: pre) {
       grid[it[0]].push_back(it[1]);
   }
   ```

   - We populate the `grid` based on the prerequisite pairs given in `pre`.

5. **BFS for Each Course**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
       queue<int> q;
       q.push(i);
       vector<int> vis(num, 0);            
       vis[i] = true;
       while(!q.empty()) {
           int sz = q.size();
           while(sz--) {
               int tmp = q.front();
               q.pop();
               for(int it: grid[tmp]) {
                   reach[i][it] = true;
                   if(vis[it]) continue;
                   vis[it] = true;
                   q.push(it);
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   - For each course `i`, we initiate a BFS:
     - We enqueue the current course and mark it as visited.
     - While there are nodes in the queue, we process each course:
       - For each dependent course `it`, we mark it as reachable from `i` in the `reach` matrix.
       - If the dependent course hasn’t been visited, we mark it as visited and enqueue it for further exploration.

6. **Preparing the Answer Vector**:
   ```cpp
   vector<bool> ans(q.size());
   for(int i = 0; i < q.size(); i++) {
       ans[i] = reach[q[i][0]][q[i][1]];
   }
   ```

   - After processing all courses, we prepare the result vector `ans`:
     - For each query, we check if the prerequisite relationship exists using the `reach` matrix.

7. **Return the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return ans;
   }
   ```

   - Finally, we return the `ans` vector containing the results for all queries.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is \( O(n^2 + m) \), where \( n \) is the number of courses and \( m \) is the number of prerequisite pairs. Each course undergoes a BFS, which can visit all edges in the worst case.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \( O(n^2) \) for the reachability matrix and \( O(n + m) \) for the adjacency list representation. Thus, the overall space complexity is dominated by the reachability matrix.

### Conclusion

This solution effectively determines the prerequisite relationships between courses using a breadth-first search approach to populate a reachability matrix. This matrix allows for efficient querying of prerequisite relationships. Key takeaways from the implementation include:

1. **Graph Representation**: The use of an adjacency list makes it easy to represent relationships between courses.

2. **BFS Traversal**: Utilizing BFS ensures that all reachable courses from a given course are identified, allowing for accurate population of the reachability matrix.

3. **Efficiency in Querying**: By preprocessing the prerequisite relationships into a matrix, we can answer each query in constant time \( O(1) \).

Overall, this approach is efficient and well-suited for solving the problem within the constraints typically found in programming challenges.
