### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom when looking at the tree from the right side.

### Approach
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Use a queue to perform level-order traversal of the tree.
   - For each level, record the last node's value, which represents the rightmost node at that level.

2. **Level Traversal**:
   - Initialize a queue and push the root node.
   - While the queue is not empty, process all nodes at the current level:
     - Record the values of the nodes at this level.
     - Enqueue the left and right children of the nodes.
   - After processing each level, add the last value of that level to the result.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the structure for a binary tree node.
- **Line 2**: Define the class `Solution`.
- **Line 3**: Define the `rightSideView` function, which takes the root of the binary tree as input.
- **Line 4**: Initialize a vector `ans` to store the result.
- **Line 5**: Check if the root is null; if so, return an empty result.
- **Line 6**: Initialize a list (acting as a queue) and push the root node.
- **Lines 7-12**: While there are nodes in the queue:
  - Create a vector `res` to hold the values of the current level's nodes.
  - Process each node at the current level, adding its value and its children to the queue.
- **Line 13**: After processing the level, push the last node's value to `ans`.
- **Line 14**: Return the result vector `ans`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree, since each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(w)\), where \(w\) is the maximum width of the tree, which is the maximum number of nodes at any level of the tree stored in the queue.
