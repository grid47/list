### Problem Statement

In this problem, we are given an array `nums` of integers, and our goal is to find the maximum number of indices that can be marked such that for every marked index `i` from the first `k` elements, the following condition holds: `nums[i] * 2 <= nums[nums.size() - k + i]`. Here, `k` is the number of marked indices. We are asked to return the maximum number of indices that can be marked in this way.

### Approach

The problem can be reduced to finding the maximum value of `k` such that there exist `k` indices from the first `k` elements and the last `k` elements of the array, satisfying the condition that `nums[i] * 2 <= nums[nums.size() - k + i]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`.

The main idea is to first sort the array, then use binary search to find the largest possible value of `k` that satisfies the condition. Once the largest value of `k` is determined, the result will be `2 * k` because the problem asks for the total number of indices that can be marked (both the first `k` and the last `k` indices).

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. **Sorting the Array**:
```cpp
sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
```
- We begin by sorting the array `nums` in ascending order. Sorting ensures that we can efficiently check the condition for the smallest and largest elements in the array. By having the array sorted, we can compare elements from the beginning and the end, which simplifies the logic and ensures correctness.

#### 2. **Helper Function `can(int k, vector<int>& nums)`**:
```cpp
bool can(int k, vector<int> &nums) {
    int ridx = k - 1;
    int lidx = nums.size() - k;
    
    for(int i = 0; i < k; i++)
        if(nums[i] * 2 > nums[nums.size() - k + i]) return false;
    
    return true;
}
```
- The function `can(int k, vector<int>& nums)` checks whether it is possible to mark `k` indices. It compares the first `k` elements of the sorted array (`nums[i]`) with the last `k` elements (`nums[nums.size() - k + i]`) to ensure that the condition `nums[i] * 2 <= nums[nums.size() - k + i]` holds for all `i`.
- If the condition holds for all `k` indices, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
- The `for` loop iterates over the first `k` elements of the array, and for each element `nums[i]`, it checks if it satisfies the condition when compared to `nums[nums.size() - k + i]` from the second half of the array.

#### 3. **Binary Search for the Maximum `k`**:
```cpp
int l = 1, r = n / 2, ans = 0;
while (l <= r) {
    int mid = l + (r - l + 1) / 2;
    if (can(mid, nums)) {
        ans = mid;
        l = mid + 1;
    } else {
        r = mid - 1;
    }
}
```
- We perform a binary search on the value of `k` ranging from `1` to `n / 2` (since `k` represents the number of indices, it cannot exceed half the size of the array).
- The binary search proceeds by checking if a mid value `mid` of `k` satisfies the condition using the `can` function. If `can(mid, nums)` returns `true`, it means that it is possible to mark `mid` indices, so we update the answer `ans` and try to find a larger value by adjusting the search range.
- If `can(mid, nums)` returns `false`, it means `mid` indices cannot be marked, so we decrease the search range to try smaller values of `k`.

#### 4. **Returning the Result**:
```cpp
return ans * 2;
```
- After the binary search completes, the value of `ans` will contain the maximum possible value of `k`. Since we are asked to return the total number of marked indices (both the first and last `k` indices), the result is `ans * 2`.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:

1. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting the array `nums` takes O(n log n) time, where `n` is the size of the array. This is the most time-consuming part of the solution.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The binary search runs for at most `log(n / 2)` iterations (which is approximately `log n`). In each iteration, we call the `can` function.

3. **Helper Function `can`**:
   - The `can` function performs a linear scan of the first `k` elements, where `k` can be at most `n / 2`. Thus, the time complexity of the `can` function is O(n / 2) in the worst case.

Combining these, the overall time complexity of the solution is dominated by the sorting step and the binary search, resulting in a time complexity of **O(n log n)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- We use `O(1)` extra space besides the input and output storage. The `can` function does not use any additional space besides the parameters, and the binary search does not require extra storage, so the space complexity is **O(1)**.

### Conclusion

The solution effectively solves the problem using a combination of sorting and binary search. By leveraging the sorted array and binary search, we efficiently find the maximum number of indices that can be marked such that the divisibility condition holds. The time complexity of O(n log n) ensures that the solution performs well even for large inputs, making it an optimal solution for this problem. The space complexity of O(1) ensures that the solution uses minimal additional memory.
