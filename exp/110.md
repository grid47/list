### Problem Statement
Determine if a binary tree is height-balanced. A binary tree is balanced if, for every node, the height difference between the left and right subtrees is at most 1.

### Approach
1. For each node, calculate the heights of its left and right subtrees.
2. Check if the absolute difference between the heights is less than or equal to 1.
3. Recursively apply the check to all nodes in the tree.
4. Define a helper function `h` to calculate the height of each subtree, returning 1 plus the maximum height of the left or right subtree.

### Code Walk-through
- **`isBalanced` function**:
  - **Line 6**: If `root` is `NULL`, the tree is balanced by definition, so return `true`.
  - **Lines 7-8**: Calculate the heights `l` and `r` of the left and right subtrees using `h`.
  - **Line 9**: Check if the tree is balanced at the root (difference in heights ≤ 1) and recursively check the left and right subtrees.
- **`h` function**:
  - **Lines 12-16**: Base case – if the node is `NULL`, return height 0.
  - Calculate the heights of left (`l`) and right (`r`) subtrees and return `1 + max(l, r)` for the total height.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N^2)\) in the worst case, as `h` is called for every node in `isBalanced`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(H)\), where \(H\) is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.
