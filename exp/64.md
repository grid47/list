### Problem Statement
Given a `m x n` grid filled with `0`s and `1`s, where `0` represents an empty cell and `1` represents an obstacle, you need to find the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. You can only move down or right at any point in time, and paths that run into obstacles are not allowed.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Create a 2D vector `dp` of size `m x n` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths to reach cell `(i, j)`.

2. **Base Case Initialization**:
   - Initialize `dp[0][0]` to `1` if the starting cell is empty (`grid[0][0] == 0`), otherwise set it to `0`.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Use nested loops to fill the DP table:
     - For each cell `(i, j)`, if it is not an obstacle (`grid[i][j] != 1`), compute the number of paths to that cell by adding:
       - The number of paths from the cell directly above `(i - 1, j)` if it is within bounds and not an obstacle.
       - The number of paths from the cell directly to the left `(i, j - 1)` if it is within bounds and not an obstacle.

4. **Result**:
   - The value in `dp[m - 1][n - 1]` will be the total number of unique paths to reach the bottom-right corner.

### Code Walk-through
- **Initialization**: The DP table is initialized based on the starting cell.
- **Dynamic Filling**: The nested loops populate the DP table, carefully checking for obstacles.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(m \times n) \) since every cell in the grid is computed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(m \times n) \) for storing the DP table.
