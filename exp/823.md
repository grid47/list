### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `arr`, each element can be used to create binary trees where each node's value is a product of its children. The goal is to find the number of distinct binary trees that can be formed with the elements of `arr` as node values.

### Approach
1. **Sorting**:
   - First, sort the array to ensure that we can always consider smaller elements as potential roots for larger elements.

2. **Dynamic Programming with a Map**:
   - Use an unordered map (`rootWithCount`) to store the number of distinct binary trees that can be formed with each value as the root.
   - Initialize the count for the first element in the sorted array to 1 since it can only form one tree (itself).

3. **Counting Combinations**:
   - For each element in `arr`, iterate through the existing keys in the map:
     - Check if the current element can be divided by the key (to see if it can be a product).
     - If it can be divided and the quotient exists in the map, compute the number of trees that can be formed using the current key and its quotient. Update the count accordingly.

4. **Final Count**:
   - Sum all values in the map to get the total number of distinct binary trees, applying the modulo operation to handle large numbers.

### Code Walk-through
- The `numFactoredBinaryTrees` function initializes a map to count trees for each element.
- It iterates through the sorted array, updating the count of possible trees for each number based on its factors.
- Finally, it aggregates the counts to return the total number of distinct binary trees.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2), where N is the number of elements in `arr`. This is due to the nested iteration through the map for each element.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for storing the counts in the map.

This approach efficiently calculates the number of distinct binary trees that can be formed using the elements of the array as node values.
