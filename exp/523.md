### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, determine if there exists a continuous subarray (of size at least two) such that the sum of the elements in the subarray is a multiple of `k`.

### Approach
1. **Use a Hash Map**:
   - Utilize a map to store the remainder of the cumulative sum when divided by `k` as the key, and the index of that remainder as the value.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - Maintain a cumulative sum while iterating through the array.
   - Calculate the remainder of the sum with respect to `k`.
   - If the remainder has been seen before, check if the distance between the current index and the index stored in the map is greater than 1.

3. **Return Result**:
   - If such a subarray exists, return `true`; otherwise, after checking all elements, return `false`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a map `mp` and initialize it with the remainder `0` at index `-1` to handle cases where the sum itself is a multiple of `k`.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - For each element in `nums`, update the cumulative sum and calculate its remainder when divided by `k`.
   - Check if this remainder has been recorded in the map.

3. **Check Subarray Length**:
   - If the remainder exists, check if the difference between the current index and the stored index is greater than 1, indicating a valid subarray.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), as the size of the map can grow up to the number of unique remainders (at most `k`).
