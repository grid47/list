### Problem Statement
Given a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

### Approach
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Traverse the grid, and whenever a '1' (land) is found, increment the island count and perform a DFS to mark all connected lands as visited (turn them into '0's).
   - This will help in avoiding counting the same island multiple times.

2. **Grid Traversal**:
   - Iterate through each cell in the grid.
   - If a cell contains '1', increment the count of islands and initiate a DFS to explore the entire island.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the class `Solution`.
- **Line 2**: Define the `numIslands` function that takes a 2D grid as input.
- **Line 3**: Initialize a counter `cnt` to zero, which will hold the number of islands.
- **Lines 4-6**: Get the dimensions of the grid (`m` rows and `n` columns) and iterate through each cell.
- **Line 7**: If a cell contains '1':
  - Increment the island counter.
  - Call the `dfs` function to explore and mark all connected lands.
- **Line 8**: Return the total count of islands.

- **Line 9**: Define the `dfs` function to perform a depth-first search.
- **Lines 10-12**: Check the boundaries of the grid and return if the current cell is out of bounds or water ('0').
- **Line 13**: Mark the current cell as visited by setting it to '0'.
- **Lines 14-17**: Recursively call `dfs` for the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns in the grid, since each cell is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the recursion stack, which can go up to \(O(m \times n)\) in the worst case if the grid is filled with '1's.
