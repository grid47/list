### Problem Statement
Design a calendar that allows for the booking of events. Your calendar should be able to handle overlapping events, but it should not allow for three events to overlap at the same time.

### Approach
1. **Event Tracking with a Map**:
   - Use a `map<int, int>` to record the changes in the number of active events at each time point. The key is the timestamp, and the value indicates how many events start or end at that timestamp.

2. **Booking Logic**:
   - For each booking request, increment the count at the start time and decrement it at the end time.
   - Maintain a counter (`bkd`) to track the number of overlapping events as you iterate through the map.
   - If at any point during the iteration the counter reaches 3, it means three events are overlapping. In that case, revert the earlier increment and decrement to cancel the current booking.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class MyCalendarTwo`: Contains methods to handle the calendar bookings.
  - **Method**: 
    - `bool book(int start, int end)`: 
      - Updates the map with the start and end of the event.
      - Iterates through the map to check for overlaps.
      - If three overlaps are detected, it undoes the changes and returns `false`.
      - Otherwise, returns `true`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N) due to the sorting of events in the map, where N is the number of events.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the events in the map.
