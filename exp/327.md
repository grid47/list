### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `lower` and `upper`, count the number of ranges `[i, j]` such that the sum of the elements from index `i` to index `j` falls within the inclusive range `[lower, upper]`.

### Approach
The approach involves using the **Prefix Sum** technique combined with **Merge Sort** to efficiently count the ranges with sums in the specified interval.

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: 
   - Calculate the prefix sums of the input array. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start of the array to the `i`-th index. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray `nums[i..j]` as `sum[j+1] - sum[i]`.

2. **Merge Sort for Counting**:
   - Use a modified merge sort to count how many of these prefix sums fall within the specified range when merging the subarrays.
   - The count of valid ranges can be efficiently computed during the merge phase by determining how many elements in the right half are within the bounds defined by the current element from the left half.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A vector of integers `nums`, and two integers `lower` and `upper`.
- **Output**: The count of valid subarray sums.

1. Calculate the prefix sums and store them in a new vector `sum`.
2. Perform a merge sort on the prefix sums while counting valid ranges:
   - The `merge` function compares elements in two halves of the array and counts how many differences fall within the specified bounds.
   - The count is updated based on how many sums satisfy the condition for the current element being examined from the left half.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\) due to the merge sort operation.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the temporary array used in merging.
