### Problem Statement

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of seconds required to remove all occurrences of the string "01" in a given binary string `s`. The string consists of only `'0'` and `'1'` characters. In one second, you can remove one occurrence of "01" by swapping the `'0'` and `'1'`. The goal is to repeatedly perform this operation until no more "01" pairs exist in the string.

For example:
- For `s = "0110101"`, the output would be `4`.
- For `s = "111"`, the output would be `0`, as there are no "01" pairs to remove.

The challenge is to calculate the number of seconds it will take to remove all such "01" pairs using the fewest steps possible.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we use a **greedy approach** combined with **simulation**. The key observation is that each second we can swap one occurrence of the pair "01" to become "10". By swapping, we reduce the number of "01" occurrences, but after each swap, a new configuration is created, which could introduce new "01" pairs that were not previously present.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Track Changes**: We need to iterate over the string and identify all instances of the pair "01". Every time such a pair is found, we swap them to create "10" and mark that the string has changed.
2. **Repeat Until No Changes**: Once a swap is made, we need to continue checking the string to see if further swaps can be performed. This process continues until no more swaps can be made.
3. **Count the Seconds**: Each time we find and swap a "01" pair, it counts as one second. We keep track of the total number of seconds taken to perform all the swaps.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Class Definition**:
    ```cpp
    class Solution {
    public:
        int secondsToRemoveOccurrences(string s) {
    ```
    - The method `secondsToRemoveOccurrences` is defined inside the `Solution` class. This method takes a string `s` as input and returns an integer representing the number of seconds required to remove all "01" pairs.

2. **Initialization**:
    ```cpp
        int seconds = 0;
        bool changed = true;
    ```
    - `seconds` keeps track of the number of seconds (or swaps) that have been made.
    - `changed` is a flag that determines whether any swaps were made in the current iteration of the loop. Initially, it's set to `true` to ensure the loop runs at least once.

3. **Main Loop**:
    ```cpp
        while(changed) {
            changed = false;
            for(int i = 0; i < s.size() - 1; i++) {
                if(s[i] == '0' && s[i + 1] == '1') {
                    swap(s[i], s[i + 1]);
                    changed = true;
                    i++;
                }
            }
            seconds += changed;
        }
    ```
    - The `while(changed)` loop continues as long as any swaps occur in the current iteration.
    - Within the loop, we initialize `changed = false` to track if any swaps occur during this iteration. If no swaps are made during a full pass, the loop will terminate.
    - The `for` loop iterates over the string (up to `s.size() - 1` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds elements). It checks for occurrences of the pair "01".
    - When a "01" pair is found, we perform a swap to change it to "10", set `changed = true` to indicate that a swap occurred, and increment `i` by 1 to skip checking the next adjacent pair (as the swapped "1" will not participate in a further swap).
    - The `seconds += changed;` statement adds 1 second to the count if any swap was made during this iteration.

4. **Return the Result**:
    ```cpp
        return seconds;
    }
    ```
    - Once the loop ends (no more swaps are possible), the method returns the total number of seconds it took to remove all occurrences of "01".

### Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
    - The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. The reason for this is that in each iteration of the `while` loop, we are making a single pass over the string (with at most one swap per iteration), and this pass can be done in linear time. The number of iterations is at most `n` because in each iteration, we can remove one "01" pair, reducing the string size effectively.
    - Thus, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the length of the string.

2. **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity of the solution is **O(1)**, as we are only using a constant amount of extra space (the variables `seconds`, `changed`, and `i`). The string `s` is modified in place, so no additional space is required for storage.

### Conclusion

This solution uses a **greedy approach** combined with **simulation** to determine the minimum number of seconds required to remove all "01" pairs from the binary string `s`. The idea of repeatedly scanning the string and performing swaps ensures that each operation reduces the number of "01" pairs in the string, and the process continues until no more swaps can be made.

The algorithm is efficient with a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string, which makes it suitable for large inputs. The space complexity is **O(1)**, making it memory efficient as well. By keeping track of changes during each iteration and counting the number of swaps, the solution efficiently solves the problem with minimal overhead.

This approach is simple and intuitive, leveraging basic string operations and the sliding window technique to handle the problem efficiently. It's a great example of how greedy algorithms can be used in combination with simulation to solve real-world problems involving sequence manipulation.
