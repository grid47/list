### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the starting indices of up to three non-overlapping subarrays of size `k` such that the sum of these subarrays is maximized. The output should be the starting indices of these subarrays.

### Approach
The solution employs a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum sum of up to three non-overlapping subarrays of size `k`. The key steps in the solution are:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - Compute a prefix sum array where `sum[i]` holds the sum of the first `i` elements. This allows us to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray of size `k`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Setup**:
   - Create a 2D vector `dp` where `dp[i][j]` stores a pair consisting of:
     - The maximum sum of `i` subarrays found using the first `j` elements.
     - A vector containing the starting indices of these subarrays.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Iterate through the number of subarrays from `1` to `3` (the maximum allowed).
   - For each count of subarrays, loop backward through the possible starting positions.
   - Calculate the total sum by considering the maximum sum of the previous subarray configuration plus the current subarray sum, updating the maximum when necessary.
   - Keep track of the indices of the chosen subarrays for reconstruction.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Reverse the indices in the final output to present them in the correct order.

### Code Walk-through
- The `maxSumOfThreeSubarrays` function first computes the prefix sum.
- It initializes the DP table and fills it based on the maximum sum conditions.
- The final indices of the three subarrays are reversed for correct output order.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the input array `nums`. This accounts for the single pass to compute the prefix sums and the subsequent passes to fill the DP table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for the DP table, as it stores results for each configuration of the subarrays.

This dynamic programming approach efficiently finds the optimal indices for the three non-overlapping subarrays that yield the maximum sum.
