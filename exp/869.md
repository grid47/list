### Problem Statement
The goal is to determine if a given integer \( n \) can be rearranged to form a power of \( 2 \). 

### Approach
1. **Count Digits**:
   - Create a function `counter(int N)` that computes a unique representation of the digits of \( N \). This is done by calculating \( \sum 10^{(N \mod 10)} \) for each digit of \( N \). This acts as a signature for the number's digits.

2. **Check Powers of 2**:
   - Loop through all powers of \( 2 \) from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{31} \) (since \( 2^{31} \) is the maximum power of \( 2 \) that fits within the bounds of a 32-bit integer).
   - For each power of \( 2 \), check if its digit signature (using the `counter` function) matches that of \( n \).

3. **Return Result**:
   - If a match is found, return `true`. If no matches are found after checking all powers, return `false`.

### Code Walk-through
- The `reorderedPowerOf2` function uses the `counter` function to compare the digit signatures of \( n \) and all powers of \( 2 \).
- The digit signature ensures that the function checks for permutations of digits rather than specific arrangements.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as the loop runs a fixed number of times (32 for powers of \( 2 \)) and checking the digit count is constant-time with respect to the number of digits in \( n \).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only a fixed amount of additional space is used.
