### Problem Statement
Given a collection of intervals, determine the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

### Approach
1. **Sorting**:
   - Start by sorting the intervals based on their start times. This helps in easily identifying overlapping intervals.

2. **Two Pointers Technique**:
   - Use two pointers: `prv` to track the last non-overlapping interval and `cur` to explore the current interval.
   - Initialize `prv` to the first interval and iterate through the rest.

3. **Check for Overlaps**:
   - For each interval, check if it overlaps with the last non-overlapping interval:
     - If it overlaps (i.e., the start of the current interval is less than the end of the last non-overlapping interval), increment the count of removed intervals (`ans`).
     - If the current interval ends before or at the same time as the last one, update `prv` to the current interval, which means the current interval is retained.

4. **Return Result**:
   - The final count of removed intervals is returned.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Sort the intervals based on the first element (start time).

2. **Iterate and Check**:
   - Start from the second interval, comparing it with the last non-overlapping interval tracked by `prv`.
   - Update the count of removed intervals and the `prv` pointer based on the overlap conditions.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N) due to sorting, where N is the number of intervals.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the in-place sorting and pointer tracking.
