### Problem Statement

The goal is to calculate the "permutation difference" between two strings `s` and `t`. The permutation difference is defined as the sum of absolute positional differences between each matching character in `s` and `t`. For every character in `s`, the code calculates the absolute positional difference for each occurrence of that character in `t`, and the total is the sum of all these differences.

### Approach

1. **Iterate Through Both Strings**: The code employs nested loops to go through each character in `s` and `t`.
2. **Calculate Absolute Positional Difference**: For each matching character pair `(s[i], t[j])`, it computes the absolute difference in their positions `abs(i - j)` and adds this difference to a cumulative sum.
3. **Return the Sum**: The cumulative sum, `sum`, which represents the total permutation difference, is returned at the end.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPermutationDifference(string s, string t) {
        int sum = 0;                           // Step 1: Initialize sum to store permutation difference.
        
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {   // Step 2: Loop through each character in `s`.
            for(int j = 0; j < t.length(); j++) { // Step 3: Loop through each character in `t`.
                
                if(s[i] == t[j])                 // Step 4: Check if characters `s[i]` and `t[j]` match.
                    sum += abs(i - j);           // Step 5: Calculate `abs(i - j)` and add to `sum`.
            }
        }
        
        return sum;                             // Step 6: Return the final permutation difference.
    }
};
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Initialize Sum Variable**:
   ```cpp
   int sum = 0;
   ```
   This variable will accumulate the permutation difference as we process each character in `s` and `t`.

2. **Outer Loop Through `s`**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
   ```
   This loop goes through each character in `s`, using `i` as the index.

3. **Inner Loop Through `t`**:
   ```cpp
   for(int j = 0; j < t.length(); j++)
   ```
   This nested loop goes through each character in `t`, using `j` as the index.

4. **Check for Character Match**:
   ```cpp
   if(s[i] == t[j])
   ```
   When `s[i]` matches `t[j]`, the characters are in the same position in both strings.

5. **Calculate and Add Positional Difference**:
   ```cpp
   sum += abs(i - j);
   ```
   The absolute difference between `i` and `j` (i.e., `abs(i - j)`) is calculated and added to `sum`.

6. **Return Total Difference**:
   ```cpp
   return sum;
   ```
   The final `sum` is returned, representing the total positional difference for all matching characters.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `t`. This is because there are two nested loops, with each loop iterating over the entirety of `s` and `t`.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is **O(1)**, as the algorithm uses only a few additional variables to store sums and indices.

### Conclusion

This solution calculates the permutation difference efficiently by iterating through each character in both strings, checking for matches, and summing the absolute positional differences. The nested loop approach is direct and suitable for smaller input sizes, though it may be optimized further for larger inputs. This method provides a straightforward way to measure the relative order of matching characters in two strings.
