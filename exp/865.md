### Problem Statement
The task is to find the subtree that contains all the deepest nodes in a given binary tree. A subtree is defined as the tree rooted at a particular node.

### Approach
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Implement a recursive function (`lcadn`) that traverses the binary tree.
   - This function returns a pair consisting of:
     - The subtree root containing all the deepest nodes.
     - The depth of that subtree.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the current node is `NULL`, return a pair of `NULL` and depth `0`.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - Recursively call the function for the left and right child nodes.
   - Compare the depths returned from the left and right subtrees:
     - If the left subtree is deeper, return the left child and increment its depth.
     - If the right subtree is deeper, return the right child and increment its depth.
     - If both depths are equal, return the current node as it is the lowest common ancestor of the deepest nodes, and increment the depth.

4. **Return Result**:
   - The main function (`subtreeWithAllDeepest`) simply calls the helper function and returns the root of the subtree containing all the deepest nodes.

### Code Walk-through
- The `subtreeWithAllDeepest` function initializes the process by calling `lcadn` on the root.
- The `lcadn` function performs the DFS and computes the necessary information to find the desired subtree.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.
