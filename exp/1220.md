### Problem Statement
The problem is to find the number of strings of length \( n \) that can be formed using vowels (a, e, i, o, u) with the following constraints:

- The string can only consist of the characters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.
- The character 'a' can only be followed by 'e'.
- The character 'e' can only be followed by 'a' or 'i'.
- The character 'i' can be followed by 'a', 'e', 'o', or 'u'.
- The character 'o' can only be followed by 'i' or 'u'.
- The character 'u' can only be followed by 'a'.

The goal is to count how many valid strings of length \( n \) can be generated under these rules, returning the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to avoid overflow.

### Approach
To solve the problem, we can use dynamic programming (DP) and recursion with memoization. The main steps in our approach are:

1. **Define a Recursive Function**: Create a recursive function that explores all possible transitions from the current vowel to the next, keeping track of the length of the string being formed.
2. **Base Case**: When the length reaches \( n \), it indicates a valid string has been formed, so we return 1.
3. **Memoization**: Store results of already computed states to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.
4. **Dynamic Transitions**: Use a switch statement to manage transitions based on the current vowel.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int n, mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
    vector<vector<int>> mem;
```
- **Line 1-3**: Define the `Solution` class, and declare necessary variables: `n` for the length of the string, `mod` for taking results modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), and `mem` to store memoized results.

```cpp
    int dp(int prv, int cur) {
        if(cur == n) return 1;
```
- **Lines 4-5**: Define the recursive function `dp`, which takes two parameters: `prv` (the previous vowel) and `cur` (the current length of the string being formed). If `cur` equals `n`, return 1, indicating that a valid string has been formed.

```cpp
        if(mem[prv][cur] != -1) return mem[prv][cur];
```
- **Line 6**: Check if the current state has already been computed (i.e., if `mem[prv][cur]` is not -1). If so, return the stored result to avoid redundant calculations.

```cpp
        long ans = 0;
```
- **Line 7**: Initialize a variable `ans` to accumulate the count of valid strings formed from the current state.

```cpp
        switch(prv) {
```
- **Line 8**: Begin a switch statement to handle different cases based on the value of `prv` (the previous vowel).

```cpp
            case 0:
                ans = (ans + dp(1, cur + 1)) % mod;
                ans = (ans + dp(2, cur + 1)) % mod;
                ans = (ans + dp(3, cur + 1)) % mod;
                ans = (ans + dp(4, cur + 1)) % mod;
                ans = (ans + dp(5, cur + 1)) % mod;
            break;
```
- **Lines 9-15**: If `prv` is `0`, it means that we can use any vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') next. Each valid transition is calculated recursively, increasing `cur` by 1 and adding to `ans`.

```cpp
            case 1: // 'a'
                ans = (ans + dp(2, cur + 1)) % mod; // can go to 'e'
                ans = (ans + dp(3, cur + 1)) % mod; // can go to 'i'
                ans = (ans + dp(5, cur + 1)) % mod; // can go to 'u'
            break;
```
- **Lines 16-20**: If `prv` is `1` (indicating the previous character is 'a'), the next character can only be 'e', 'i', or 'u'.

```cpp
            case 2: // 'e'
                ans = (ans + dp(1, cur + 1)) % mod; // can go to 'a'
                ans = (ans + dp(3, cur + 1)) % mod; // can go to 'i'
            break;
```
- **Lines 21-25**: If `prv` is `2` (previous character 'e'), the next can be 'a' or 'i'.

```cpp
            case 3: // 'i'
                ans = (ans + dp(2, cur + 1)) % mod; // can go to 'e'
                ans = (ans + dp(4, cur + 1)) % mod; // can go to 'o'
            break;
```
- **Lines 26-30**: If `prv` is `3` (previous character 'i'), the next can be 'e' or 'o'.

```cpp
            case 4: // 'o'
                ans = (ans + dp(3, cur + 1)) % mod; // can go to 'i'
                ans = (ans + dp(5, cur + 1)) % mod; // can go to 'u'
            break;
```
- **Lines 31-35**: If `prv` is `4` (previous character 'o'), the next can be 'i' or 'u'.

```cpp
            case 5: // 'u'
                ans = (ans + dp(3, cur + 1)) % mod; // can go to 'i'
            break;                                                                        
        }
```
- **Lines 36-40**: If `prv` is `5` (previous character 'u'), the next can only be 'i'.

```cpp
        return mem[prv][cur] = ans;
    }
```
- **Line 41**: Store the computed value of `ans` in `mem[prv][cur]` before returning it.

```cpp
    int countVowelPermutation(int n) {
        this->n = n;
        mem.resize(8, vector<int>(n + 1, -1));
        return dp(0, 0);
    }
};
```
- **Lines 42-45**: Define the `countVowelPermutation` function. It initializes `n` and resizes the memoization table `mem` to hold results for all possible previous vowels and string lengths. It then calls the `dp` function starting with `prv = 0` (indicating no previous vowel) and `cur = 0`.

### Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the strings being generated. This is because we calculate the number of valid strings recursively while storing results in a memoization table to avoid duplicate computations.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the memoization table, which holds results for each combination of previous vowel and current length.

### Conclusion
The `countVowelPermutation` function provides an efficient way to calculate the number of valid vowel strings of length \( n \) using dynamic programming and memoization. By carefully managing transitions between vowels and utilizing recursion, the solution ensures that all possible valid strings are counted while minimizing redundant calculations. This method demonstrates the power of dynamic programming in solving combinatorial problems and can be applied to various similar challenges in algorithm design.
