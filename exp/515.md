### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, return an array containing the largest value from each row of the tree.

### Approach
1. **Level Order Traversal**:
   - Use a queue to perform a level order traversal (BFS) of the binary tree.
   - At each level, track the maximum value encountered.

2. **Iterate Through Levels**:
   - For each level, initialize a variable to hold the maximum value for that level.
   - Update this maximum value as you traverse each node in the level.

3. **Enqueue Children**:
   - For each node, enqueue its left and right children for processing in the next level.

4. **Store Results**:
   - After processing all nodes at a level, append the maximum value to the results vector.

5. **Return Result**:
   - The results vector will contain the largest value from each row in the binary tree.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `largestValues` function takes a pointer to the root of the binary tree.

2. **Queue Initialization**:
   - Initialize a queue and push the root node into it.
   - Check if the root is null; if so, return an empty result vector.

3. **Level Traversal**:
   - While the queue is not empty, determine the number of nodes at the current level.
   - Initialize `mx` to keep track of the maximum value at that level.

4. **Node Processing**:
   - Process all nodes at the current level, updating `mx` with the maximum value found.
   - Enqueue the left and right children of each node if they exist.

5. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all levels, return the `res` vector containing the largest values.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, since each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree, due to the queue used for level order traversal.
