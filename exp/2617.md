### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find the minimum number of cells visited in a grid starting from the top-left cell (0,0) to the bottom-right cell (m-1, n-1). Each cell in the grid contains a positive integer that indicates how many cells you can move in one step, either horizontally or vertically. The goal is to traverse the grid while minimizing the number of steps taken to reach the target cell.

### Approach

The problem can be approached using a **modified Dijkstra's algorithm** (a shortest-path algorithm), where instead of minimizing the distance between nodes, we are minimizing the number of visited cells. The basic idea is to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) with priority queue, exploring the grid while ensuring that we are visiting the minimum number of cells.

1. **Priority Queue**: 
   - A priority queue is used to prioritize cells that have the least number of visited cells (similar to Dijkstra's algorithm).
   
2. **Distance Array**: 
   - A distance array `dist[i][j]` keeps track of the minimum number of cells visited to reach the cell `(i, j)`. Initially, all cells are set to infinity except the start cell `(0,0)` which is initialized with a distance of 1.

3. **Cell Movement**: 
   - From each cell `(i, j)`, you can move up to `grid[i][j]` steps in both the horizontal and vertical directions. For each direction, we check if visiting the new cell will reduce the number of visited cells compared to the current best path. If so, we update the distance for that cell and add it to the priority queue.

4. **Termination**:
   - The algorithm terminates when we reach the bottom-right cell `(m-1, n-1)`, and the value in `dist[m-1][n-1]` will be the minimum number of cells visited to reach the destination. If there is no valid path, the function returns `-1`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `m` and `n` represent the dimensions of the grid.
   - `dist` is a 2D array where each entry stores the minimum number of cells visited to reach that cell. It is initialized with `INT_MAX` (representing infinity), except for the start cell `(0,0)`, which is initialized with `1` since we start from there.
   - A priority queue `pq` is used to explore the cells. It stores pairs where the first value is the number of cells visited, and the second value is a pair of indices `(i, j)` representing the position of the cell.

```cpp
int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
vector<vector<int>> dist(m, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
priority_queue<pair<int, pair<int, int>>, vector<pair<int, pair<int, int>>>, greater<pair<int, pair<int, int>>>> pq;
pq.push({1, {0, 0}});
dist[0][0] = 1;
```

2. **BFS with Priority Queue**:
   - We use a while loop to process the priority queue. Each time we pop the top element, it represents the cell with the minimum number of visited cells.
   - From the current cell `(i, j)`, we attempt to move right and down. For each move, we check if visiting the new cell improves the number of cells visited. If it does, we update the `dist` array and push the new cell into the priority queue.

```cpp
while(!pq.empty()) {
    int d = pq.top().first;  // Current number of visited cells
    int i = pq.top().second.first;  // Current row
    int j = pq.top().second.second;  // Current column
    if(i == m - 1 && j == n - 1) return d;  // If we reached the bottom-right cell
    pq.pop();
```

3. **Horizontal Moves**:
   - For the horizontal moves, we try to move from cell `(i, j)` to the next cells in the same row, from `j+1` to `min(n-1, j + grid[i][j])`. If the new position reduces the number of visited cells, we update the `dist` array and push the new position into the priority queue.

```cpp
for(int k = j + 1; k <= min(n - 1, j + grid[i][j]); k++) {
    if(dist[i][k] > d + 1) {
        dist[i][k] = d + 1;
        pq.push({d + 1, {i, k}});
        if(i == m - 1 && k == n - 1) return d + 1;  // Check if we reached the target
    }
}
```

4. **Vertical Moves**:
   - Similarly, for the vertical moves, we try to move from cell `(i, j)` to the next cells in the same column, from `i+1` to `min(m-1, i + grid[i][j])`. Again, if the new position reduces the number of visited cells, we update the `dist` array and push the new position into the priority queue.

```cpp
for(int k = i + 1; k <= min(m - 1, i + grid[i][j]); k++) {
    if(dist[k][j] > d + 1) {
        dist[k][j] = d + 1;
        pq.push({d + 1, {k, j}});
        if(k == m - 1 && j == n - 1) return d + 1;  // Check if we reached the target
    }
}
```

5. **Return Result**:
   - If we finish processing all the cells and never reach the bottom-right corner, we return `-1` indicating that it's not possible to reach the target.

```cpp
return -1;
```

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Priority Queue Operations**: The priority queue stores at most `m * n` elements. For each element, we perform constant-time operations (push and pop). Hence, the total time complexity for priority queue operations is \(O((m \cdot n) \log (m \cdot n))\).
- **Updating Distances**: Each cell is visited at most once, and for each visit, we update the distance for up to 2 directions (right and down). This results in \(O(m \cdot n)\) operations.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is:

\[
O((m \cdot n) \log (m \cdot n))
\]

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is determined by the space needed for the `dist` array and the priority queue. Both of these require \(O(m \cdot n)\) space.
  
Thus, the space complexity is:

\[
O(m \cdot n)
\]

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently finds the minimum number of cells visited to reach the bottom-right cell using a **modified Dijkstra's algorithm** with a priority queue. By using a priority queue, we ensure that we always explore the cell with the least number of visited cells, thus guaranteeing the minimum steps required. The algorithm is efficient with a time complexity of \(O((m \cdot n) \log (m \cdot n))\), making it suitable for moderately sized grids.
