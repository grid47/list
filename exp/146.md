### Problem Statement
Design a data structure that implements an LRU cache. The cache should support the following operations:
- `get(key)`: Retrieve the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, return -1.
- `put(key, value)`: Update the value of the key if it exists. If the key does not exist, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.

### Approach
1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a **map** to store the key and an iterator pointing to its position in the list.
   - Use a **doubly linked list** (implemented as a list of pairs) to maintain the order of usage. The front of the list represents the most recently used item, and the back represents the least recently used item.

2. **Operations**:
   - **Get**:
     - If the key is not found, return -1.
     - If the key is found, move the corresponding item to the front of the list (marking it as most recently used) and return its value.
   - **Put**:
     - If the key already exists, update its value and move it to the front of the list.
     - If the key does not exist, add it to the front of the list.
     - If adding the new key-value pair exceeds the cache capacity, remove the least recently used item (back of the list).

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1-2**: Define the `LRUCache` class containing necessary data structures:
  - `mp`: A map that associates keys with iterators pointing to their positions in the list.
  - `q`: A doubly linked list (using a list of pairs) to store key-value pairs.
  - `cap`: An integer representing the cache's capacity.
  
- **Line 3-10**: Constructor to initialize the cache with a specified capacity.
  
- **Line 12-21**: Implement the `get` function:
  - Check if the key exists in the map.
  - If not, return -1.
  - If it exists, retrieve the iterator, erase the current entry from the list, push it to the front, update the map, and return the value.
  
- **Line 23-38**: Implement the `put` function:
  - If the key already exists, erase it from the list, push the new value to the front, and update the map.
  - If the key does not exist, push it to the front and update the map.
  - If the cache exceeds capacity, erase the least recently used item from both the list and the map.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - `get`: \(O(1)\) since both map lookups and list operations are constant time.
  - `put`: \(O(1)\) for the same reasons.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(C)\), where \(C\) is the capacity of the cache, as we store up to \(C\) key-value pairs.
