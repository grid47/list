### Problem Statement
Given a 2D grid of integers, your task is to count the number of 3x3 magic squares that can be found within the grid. A magic square is defined as a 3x3 grid where the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and both main diagonals is the same, and all numbers are distinct and between 1 and 9 inclusive.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Counters**:
   - Create a counter to keep track of the number of magic squares found.

2. **Iterate Over the Grid**:
   - Loop through each possible 3x3 sub-grid in the given grid. This requires iterating from 0 to `m-2` for rows and 0 to `n-2` for columns.

3. **Check for Magic Square**:
   - For each 3x3 sub-grid, use a helper function `isMagic` to check if it satisfies the properties of a magic square.
   - The helper function will check:
     - All numbers are between 1 and 9 and are distinct.
     - The sums of all rows, columns, and diagonals are equal.

4. **Count Valid Squares**:
   - If a sub-grid is a magic square, increment the counter.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - After iterating through all possible sub-grids, return the count of magic squares.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid. Each potential 3x3 sub-grid is checked in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for auxiliary space since the check can be done using fixed-size arrays.
