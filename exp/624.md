### Problem Statement
You are given a 2D list `arrays` where each sublist contains distinct integers sorted in increasing order. Your task is to find the maximum distance between the smallest and largest elements of different sublists. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between two elements taken from different sublists.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `res` to store the maximum distance found.
   - Set `mn` (minimum) to a large value (e.g., 10000) and `mx` (maximum) to a small value (e.g., -10000) to keep track of the minimum and maximum values encountered.

2. **Iterate Through Each Sublist**:
   - For each sublist `a` in `arrays`, compute the potential maximum distance:
     - The distance between the maximum element of the current sublist (`a.back()`) and the minimum element of the previous sublists (`mn`).
     - The distance between the maximum element of the previous sublists (`mx`) and the minimum element of the current sublist (`a.front()`).
   - Update `res` to be the maximum of its current value and the computed distances.

3. **Update Minimum and Maximum**:
   - Update `mn` to be the minimum of its current value and the first element of the current sublist.
   - Update `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the last element of the current sublist.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, return `res`, which contains the maximum distance found.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of sublists in `arrays`. Each sublist is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space proportional to the input size is used.
