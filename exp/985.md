### Problem Statement

The problem asks to calculate the sum of all even numbers in an array `A` after performing a series of queries. Each query consists of two elements: a number `x` and an index `i`. The task is to add `x` to `A[i]` and compute the sum of all even numbers in the array after each query.

The array can contain both even and odd numbers, and after each update, the goal is to efficiently compute and return the sum of all even numbers in the array.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to efficiently track the sum of even numbers in the array while performing the updates specified by the queries.

We use a **greedy approach** combined with a **lazy evaluation strategy** to handle the updates and sum computation:

1. **Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - First, we compute the sum of all even numbers in the array `A` before any updates. This is done using the `accumulate` function, which iterates through the array and adds up the even numbers.
   - The key observation here is that we only need to track the sum of even numbers, which means odd numbers are ignored during the initial calculation.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(x, i)`, we first check if `A[i]` is even. If it is, we subtract it from the current sum, as we are going to modify `A[i]` by adding `x` to it.
   - After performing the update (`A[i] += x`), we check if the updated value of `A[i]` is even. If it is, we add it to the current sum.
   - This process allows us to efficiently track the sum of even numbers after each update without needing to re-scan the entire array after every query.

3. **Efficient Update and Result Calculation**:
   - After processing each query, the sum of even numbers is appended to the result array.
   - By maintaining a running sum of even numbers and only updating it when necessary, we avoid redundant computations and achieve an efficient solution.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. **Initial Setup and Sum Calculation**:
```cpp
vector<int> res = {};
int sum = accumulate(begin(A), end(A), 0, [](int s, int a) {
    return s + (a % 2 == 0? a : 0);
});
```
- We start by initializing an empty result vector `res` to store the sum of even numbers after each query.
- The variable `sum` is initialized by calculating the sum of all even numbers in the array `A`. This is done using the `accumulate` function, which iterates over each element of the array and adds the element to the sum if it is even (checked with `a % 2 == 0`).

#### 2. **Processing Each Query**:
```cpp
for(auto &q: qs) {
    if(A[q[1]] % 2 == 0) sum -= A[q[1]];
    A[q[1]] += q[0];
    if(A[q[1]] % 2 == 0) sum += A[q[1]];
    res.push_back(sum);
}
```
- For each query `q`, the following steps are performed:
  1. We check if `A[q[1]]` (the current value at index `q[1]`) is even. If it is, we subtract it from the sum, as it is about to be updated.
  2. The value `q[0]` (the number to be added) is added to `A[q[1]]`, effectively updating the element at index `q[1]`.
  3. After the update, we check if the new value of `A[q[1]]` is even. If it is, we add it to the sum.
  4. Finally, the updated sum is pushed to the `res` vector.

#### 3. **Returning the Result**:
```cpp
return res;
```
- Once all queries are processed, the result vector `res` is returned, which contains the sum of all even numbers after each query.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Initial Sum Calculation**: The initial sum calculation using `accumulate` takes **O(n)** time, where `n` is the size of the array `A`.
- **Processing Each Query**: For each query, we perform constant-time operations to update the array and the sum. Therefore, processing all `q` queries takes **O(q)** time, where `q` is the number of queries.
- Overall, the time complexity is **O(n + q)**, where `n` is the size of the array `A` and `q` is the number of queries.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(n + q)** due to the storage required for the result vector `res` and the array `A`. The space used by other variables (like `sum` and the loop variables) is constant, so it does not affect the overall space complexity.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the sum of even numbers in the array `A` after each query by maintaining a running sum of even numbers and only updating it when necessary. By using a greedy approach and avoiding redundant computations, the solution ensures optimal time complexity of **O(n + q)**, making it suitable for larger inputs. The space complexity is also efficient, using **O(n + q)** space to store the result and input data.

This approach provides an elegant and efficient solution to the problem by leveraging the power of accumulation and careful updates to track the sum of even numbers after each query.
