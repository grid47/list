### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `A` and a list of queries `qs`, where each query contains two integers `[val, index]`:
1. Add `val` to `A[index]`.
2. Return the sum of all even numbers in `A` after each query.

### Approach
- **Initial Sum Calculation**: Calculate the initial sum of all even numbers in `A`.
- **Query Processing**: For each query:
  - If the current number at `A[index]` is even, subtract it from the even sum.
  - Update `A[index]` by adding `val`.
  - If the updated `A[index]` is even, add it to the even sum.
- **Result Storage**: Store the even sum after each query in `res`.

### Code Walk-through
1. Initialize `sum` with the sum of even numbers in `A`.
2. Loop through each query:
   - Adjust the sum if `A[index]` is even before the addition.
   - Apply the addition, and adjust the sum again if the new `A[index]` is even.
3. Append the updated even sum to `res` after each query.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n is the length of `A` and m is the number of queries, due to the initial even-sum calculation and single pass through the queries.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of queries, for storing the results.
