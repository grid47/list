### Problem Statement
The problem requires finding all unique combinations of candidate numbers from a list that sum up to a given target. Each number can be used an unlimited number of times. The output should be a list of all the unique combinations.

### Approach
1. **Backtracking**: Use a backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations.
2. **Base Cases**:
   - If the current index exceeds the list of candidates or if the remaining sum becomes zero, check if the sum equals zero and add the current combination to the results.
   - If the remaining sum becomes negative, terminate that path of exploration.
3. **Recursion**:
   - Include the current candidate in the combination and continue searching with the same index (to allow for reusing the candidate).
   - Exclude the current candidate and move to the next index.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: The `combinationSum` function initializes the answer vector and the temporary storage vector.
2. **Backtracking Function**: 
   - Check if the sum is zero or negative.
   - If valid, push the current candidate to the temporary vector and recurse with the updated sum.
   - Pop the last candidate before exploring the next option (without the current candidate).
3. **Return Value**: Return the vector containing all valid combinations after the backtracking completes.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is exponential, \(O(2^{\text{n}})\), due to the exploration of combinations.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(\text{n})\) due to the recursion stack and temporary storage for combinations.
