### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of arithmetic slices in the array. A slice is an arithmetic slice if it has at least three elements and the difference between consecutive elements is the same.

### Approach
1. **Use Dynamic Programming with Hash Maps**:
   - We can utilize a list of maps (`mp`) to track the counts of differences for pairs of indices. This allows us to efficiently count arithmetic sequences.

2. **Iterate Through Each Pair**:
   - For each element `nums[i]`, iterate through all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`).
   - Calculate the difference (`diff`) between `nums[j]` and `nums[i]`.

3. **Check for Valid Differences**:
   - Ensure the difference lies within the range of `int` to prevent overflow issues. If it does, convert it to an integer.

4. **Count Existing and New Sequences**:
   - Use the current element's map to retrieve the count of slices that end at `nums[j]` with the same difference (`c2`).
   - The result (`res`) is updated by adding `c2`, as these are the number of valid arithmetic slices that can be extended by `nums[i]`.
   - Update the current element's map with the new count for the difference, which is the sum of counts from both `mp[i]` and `mp[j]`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, return the total count of arithmetic slices found.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a variable `res` to store the result and a vector of maps (`mp`) to store the count of differences for each index.

2. **Nested Loops for Pair Comparison**:
   - The outer loop goes through each element, while the inner loop checks each previous element for differences.
   - Compute the difference and check its validity before proceeding.

3. **Updating Counts**:
   - Retrieve counts from the maps for both current and previous elements.
   - Update the result based on existing counts of differences.

4. **Returning the Count**:
   - Return the accumulated count of arithmetic slices after processing all pairs.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. The algorithm iterates through pairs of elements.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * m), where `m` is the average number of unique differences per element, as we maintain a map for each index.
