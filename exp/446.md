### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to find the number of arithmetic slices in a given array of integers `nums`. An arithmetic slice is a subarray of at least three elements such that the difference between consecutive elements is constant. Specifically, an arithmetic slice is defined as a subarray `[a, b, c, ...]` where `b - a == c - b == ...`.

Given an array of integers, the goal is to return the total number of arithmetic slices in the array. This problem requires efficiently counting subarrays where the differences between consecutive elements are the same.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider an optimized approach that avoids brute-force checking of all possible subarrays. Instead, we can use dynamic programming with hashing to count valid arithmetic slices while iterating through the array.

1. **Difference Between Elements**: The key observation for identifying arithmetic slices is that consecutive elements of the slice must have a constant difference. For every pair of elements, we can compute the difference and store this information to check whether the slice continues to follow the same arithmetic progression.

2. **Dynamic Programming with Maps**: We use a dynamic programming approach where:
   - `mp[i]` is a map that stores the number of times a particular difference occurs up to index `i`. The key in the map is the difference `diff`, and the value is the count of how many times this difference has been encountered.
   - For each pair of indices `i` and `j`, where `j < i`, we calculate the difference `diff = nums[i] - nums[j]`. This difference determines if the subarray between `j` and `i` can continue a valid arithmetic slice. If so, we update our count for the number of valid slices at `i`.

3. **Counting Slices**: For every element `nums[i]`, the number of valid arithmetic slices ending at `i` is given by the count of pairs `(j, i)` where `nums[i] - nums[j]` is the same as the difference of some previous elements. This is maintained in the map `mp[i]`.

4. **Optimizing Storage**: To prevent overflow or incorrect results, we need to ensure that the difference fits within the bounds of a 32-bit integer (`INT_MIN` to `INT_MAX`), which is why we check if the difference is out of bounds before proceeding.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

```cpp
int n = nums.size(), res = 0;
vector<map<int, int>> mp(n);
```

- `n` represents the number of elements in the input array `nums`.
- `res` is the variable that will store the final count of arithmetic slices.
- `mp` is a vector of maps, where each map corresponds to an index `i` in the array and stores the count of different differences at that index.

#### Step 2: Iterate Through the Array

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    mp[i].clear();
    for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
        long diff = (long) nums[j] - nums[i];
        if(diff < INT_MIN || diff > INT_MAX) continue;
        int d = (int) diff;
```

- We iterate through the array `nums` using two nested loops: the outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`, and the inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `i - 1`. This allows us to compare each pair `(nums[i], nums[j])`.
- `mp[i].clear()` resets the map for each index `i` to store new differences encountered at that index.
- We calculate the difference `diff` between `nums[j]` and `nums[i]`. This difference is used to check if the pair `(j, i)` can form part of an arithmetic progression.
- If the difference exceeds the bounds of a 32-bit integer (`INT_MIN` to `INT_MAX`), we skip that pair to avoid overflow or errors.

#### Step 3: Check if the Difference Exists in the Map

```cpp
int c1 = mp[i][d];
int c2 = mp[j][d];                
res += c2;
mp[i][d] = c1 + c2 + 1;
```

- `c1` represents the count of arithmetic slices ending at `i` with the difference `d`.
- `c2` represents the count of arithmetic slices ending at `j` with the difference `d`.
- We increment `res` by `c2` because every arithmetic slice ending at `j` with the same difference can be extended by the pair `(j, i)`.
- We update the count of the difference `d` in `mp[i]` to reflect the number of valid slices ending at `i` that have the same difference. The value `c1 + c2 + 1` is used to include the current pair `(j, i)` as a new slice.

#### Step 4: Return the Result

```cpp
return res;
```

- After iterating through all pairs, the variable `res` contains the total number of arithmetic slices in the array, which is then returned.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The outer loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the size of the input array `nums`.
- The inner loop runs `i` times for each `i`, making the total number of iterations of the inner loop approximately `O(n^2)`.
- For each pair `(i, j)`, we perform constant time operations such as calculating the difference and updating the map.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n^2)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is dominated by the storage used for the map `mp`. Since each index has a map that stores differences, the space complexity is proportional to the number of distinct differences encountered, which is at most `O(n^2)` in the worst case.
- Therefore, the space complexity is **O(n^2)**.

### Conclusion

The solution uses dynamic programming with a hash map to efficiently count the number of arithmetic slices in an array. By iterating through each pair of elements, it dynamically tracks the differences and updates the number of valid slices. This approach provides a significant optimization over brute-force methods, although it still has a time complexity of **O(n^2)**. 

This algorithm efficiently handles the problem with a balance of time complexity and space complexity, making it suitable for moderately large inputs.
