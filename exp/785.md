### Problem Statement
Determine if a given graph is bipartite. A bipartite graph can be colored using two colors in such a way that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

### Approach
1. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - Implement a Union-Find (DSU) to manage connected components of the graph.
   - The `UF` class keeps track of connected components and supports union and find operations.

2. **Graph Traversal**:
   - For each vertex, check its neighbors.
   - If a neighbor is in the same connected component as the current vertex, return false (indicating the graph is not bipartite).
   - If they are not connected, union the current vertex with the neighbor.

3. **Return Value**:
   - If no conflicts are found, the graph is bipartite, and return true.

### Code Walk-through
- **Classes**:
  - `class UF`: Implements the Union-Find structure.
    - `vector<int> chd`: Stores the parent or root of each node.
    - `int cnt`: Tracks the number of unique components.
    - `UF(int n)`: Initializes the Union-Find structure with `n` nodes.
    - `bool uni(int x, int y)`: Unions two nodes and returns true if they were previously disconnected.
    - `int find(int x)`: Finds the root of the node, applying path compression.
  
- **Main Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the main function for checking if the graph is bipartite.
    - `bool isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& gph)`: Main function that checks the bipartiteness of the graph.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `gph`: The adjacency list representing the graph.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, due to the need to visit each edge and vertex.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V), for the Union-Find data structure.
