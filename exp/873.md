### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence. A Fibonacci-like sequence is defined as a sequence of numbers where the next number is the sum of the previous two. The subsequence should consist of at least three elements.

### Approach
1. **Use a Set for Fast Lookups**: Store the elements of the array in an unordered set to allow O(1) time complexity for checking the presence of elements.

2. **Iterate Over Pairs**: Use two nested loops to iterate through every pair of indices `(i, j)` in the array:
   - For each pair `(arr[i], arr[j])`, initialize two variables `a` and `b` to represent the two numbers in the Fibonacci-like sequence and a counter `l` to track the length of the sequence.

3. **Build the Fibonacci Sequence**: In a while loop, continue to check if the sum of `a` and `b` exists in the set:
   - If it does, update `a` and `b` for the next Fibonacci number and increment the length counter `l`.
   - If it doesnâ€™t, break out of the loop.

4. **Update the Result**: Update the maximum length found if `l` exceeds the current maximum.

5. **Return the Result**: If the longest length found is greater than 2, return it; otherwise, return 0, since at least three elements are needed for a valid Fibonacci-like subsequence.

### Code Walk-through
- The function initializes a set from the input array to facilitate fast element lookups.
- It iterates through each unique pair of elements, builds the Fibonacci-like sequence starting from that pair, and checks for the existence of the next Fibonacci number in the set.
- It keeps track of the maximum length of valid Fibonacci-like sequences.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where \( n \) is the size of the array. The nested loops iterate through pairs, and the while loop checks for Fibonacci numbers, which runs in constant time on average due to the set lookup.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the elements in the unordered set.
