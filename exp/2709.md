### Problem Statement

The problem asks whether it's possible to traverse all pairs of integers in the given array such that each pair is connected through a series of common factors. The goal is to determine if all the numbers in the array are connected through their prime factors, forming a connected graph. Specifically, we are tasked with checking if all the integers in the array can be traversed starting from any given integer by following common factors between them. 

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to model the array of integers as a graph, where each integer is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if they share a common factor greater than 1. The main idea is to determine if all nodes (integers) are in the same connected component, i.e., they are all connected directly or indirectly through common factors. This problem can be efficiently solved using the **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)** data structure, which allows us to group connected components and check if they are connected.

The approach involves the following key steps:

1. **Factorization of Numbers**: For each integer in the array, find all of its prime factors.
2. **Union-Find Setup**: Use the Union-Find data structure to group integers that share common prime factors.
3. **Union-Find Operations**:
   - **Find**: Determines the root of the set that a particular integer belongs to.
   - **Join**: Unites two sets (i.e., connects two integers if they share a common factor).
4. **Checking Connectivity**: After processing all integers, check if all the integers belong to the same connected component. If they do, the answer is `true`; otherwise, it's `false`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Union-Find Data Structure

```cpp
class UF {
public:
    vector<int> parent;
    vector<int> rank;

    UF(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        rank.resize(n, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }

    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);  // Path compression
        }
        return parent[x];
    }

    void join(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);

        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
                rank[rootY]++;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

- **Initialization**:
    - The `UF` class initializes the `parent` and `rank` vectors. Each element is its own parent initially, meaning each integer is in its own set.
    - The `rank` is used to keep the tree flat during the union process by always attaching the smaller tree under the larger one.

- **Find Function**:
    - The `find` function uses path compression to optimize the process. If an integer is not its own parent, it recursively finds its root and compresses the path, making future lookups faster.

- **Join Function**:
    - The `join` function unites two sets. If two integers share a common prime factor, they are united in the same set. It uses the union by rank technique to maintain a balanced tree.

#### Factorization Helper Function

```cpp
vector<int> factors(int num) {
    vector<int> ans;
    for (int j = 2; j * j <= num; j++) {
        while (num % j == 0) {
            num /= j;
            ans.push_back(j);
        }
    }
    if (num != 1) ans.push_back(num);
    return ans;
}
```

- This helper function returns all prime factors of a given number `num`.
- The function iterates over all numbers from `2` to `sqrt(num)` and checks if they divide `num`. If they do, it adds them to the list of factors and divides `num` by that factor. This ensures we get all prime factors.
- If the number is greater than `1` after the loop, it means `num` itself is a prime factor and is added to the list.

#### Main Function - `canTraverseAllPairs`

```cpp
bool canTraverseAllPairs(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n  = nums.size();
    UF *uf = new UF(n);  // Create a Union-Find structure for the integers
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;  // Map to store the first occurrence of each prime factor

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        int num = nums[i];
        vector<int> fact = factors(num);  // Get prime factors of the current number
        for (int x : fact) {
            if (mp.count(x)) {  // If the prime factor has been seen before, union the sets
                uf->join(i, mp[x]);
            } else {
                mp[x] = i;  // If this is the first time seeing the prime factor, store its index
            }
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (uf->find(i) != uf->find(0)) return false;  // Check if all elements are connected
    }
    return true;
}
```

1. **Initialize Union-Find**: We create a `UF` object with `n` elements (where `n` is the size of the input array `nums`).
2. **Factorize Each Number**: For each number in the array, we find its prime factors using the `factors` helper function.
3. **Union by Common Factors**: For each prime factor of a number, we check if we've encountered it before (using `mp`). If we have, we call `join` to unite the sets of the current number and the previously encountered number. If we haven't, we store the index of the current number for that prime factor.
4. **Check Connectivity**: After processing all the numbers, we check if all elements belong to the same connected component by calling `find` on each element and comparing it with `find(0)` (the root of the first element).

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity

1. **Factorization Complexity**: For each number, we perform a factorization up to `sqrt(num)`. In the worst case, if the numbers are large, this can take `O(sqrt(N))` time for each number.
2. **Union-Find Operations**: Each `find` and `join` operation takes almost constant time due to the path compression and union by rank, i.e., `O(α(n))`, where `α` is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows extremely slowly and can be considered constant for all practical inputs.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is approximately **O(n * sqrt(N))**, where `n` is the number of elements and `N` is the largest number in the input array.

#### Space Complexity

- We use extra space for the Union-Find data structure (`O(n)`), the map `mp` (`O(n)`), and the factorization results (`O(log N)` space for each number in the worst case). Hence, the space complexity is **O(n + n * log N)**.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently determines if all integers in the input array can be connected through common prime factors using the Union-Find data structure. By factoring each number and connecting elements that share prime factors, we can check for connectivity. The algorithm is optimized with path compression and union by rank to ensure that operations are nearly constant time. The overall time complexity is manageable even for large arrays with larger numbers.
