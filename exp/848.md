### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and an array `shifts` of the same length as `s`. Each element in `shifts` indicates how many positions to shift the corresponding character in `s`. The goal is to perform the shifts cumulatively and return the resulting string.

### Approach
1. **Calculate Cumulative Shifts**:
   - Iterate through the `shifts` array from the second last element to the first (right to left).
   - For each element, add it to the next element and take modulo 26 (since there are 26 letters in the alphabet). This gives the cumulative shifts for each character.

2. **Shift Characters**:
   - For each character in the string `s`, calculate its new position by adding the corresponding cumulative shift from the `shifts` array.
   - Use modulo 26 to wrap around the alphabet, ensuring the new character remains a lowercase letter.

3. **Return Result**: Convert the resulting characters back to a string and return it.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the string `s`. This is due to the two linear passes through the `shifts` and `s` arrays.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the shifting is done in-place and we do not use any additional data structures that scale with input size.
