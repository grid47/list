### Problem Statement

The problem requires generating all possible subsets of a list of integers `nums`, but with a constraint: **duplicate subsets** should be avoided. In other words, if the input contains duplicate elements, only one occurrence of each subset should appear in the final result.

For example:
- Input: `nums = [1, 2, 2]`
- Output: `[[1, 2, 2], [1, 2], [1], [2, 2], [2], []]`

The challenge here is to find an efficient way to generate subsets while ensuring no duplicates are included in the final result.

### Approach

The solution can be approached using **backtracking** combined with a **set** (or a map in this case) to ensure that duplicate subsets are not included in the answer. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving the problem:

1. **Sort the Input**: Sorting the list `nums` is essential to avoid generating duplicate subsets during the backtracking process. By sorting the list, we ensure that identical elements are adjacent, and we can easily skip over them when generating subsets.

2. **Backtracking Function**: The backtracking function generates subsets by:
   - Recursively including or excluding each element in the list.
   - Storing each subset in a temporary list `tmp`.
   - Checking for duplicates by using a map (`mp`) to track the subsets that have already been generated.

3. **Tracking Unique Subsets**: The use of a `map` (or set) is critical to eliminate duplicate subsets. If a subset already exists in the map, it will not be added again.

4. **Backtracking Logic**:
   - We first decide not to include the current element.
   - Then, we decide to include the current element and recurse.
   - After backtracking (removing the element from the temporary subset), we move on to the next element.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initial Setup

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> subsetsWithDup(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<vector<int>> ans;
    vector<int> tmp;
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());  // Sort to handle duplicates
    mp.clear();  // Clear the map to avoid stale data from previous calls
    bt(ans, tmp, nums, 0);  // Start the backtracking process
    return ans;
}
```

- `ans`: A vector of vectors that will store all unique subsets.
- `tmp`: A temporary vector used during the backtracking process to store the current subset.
- `nums`: The input list of numbers that needs to be processed.
- The input list `nums` is sorted to make sure duplicates are adjacent. This is key for eliminating duplicate subsets.
- The backtracking function `bt` is called, passing the initial values and starting from index `0`.

#### Step 2: The Backtracking Function

```cpp
void bt(vector<vector<int>> &ans, vector<int> &tmp, vector<int> &nums, int idx) {
    if(idx == nums.size()) {  // Base case: if we've processed all elements
        if(!mp.count(tmp)) {  // Check if the subset is unique
            ans.push_back(tmp);  // Add the subset to the answer
            mp[tmp] = true;  // Mark the subset as seen
        }
        return;
    }
    
    bt(ans, tmp, nums, idx + 1);  // Skip the current element
    
    tmp.push_back(nums[idx]);  // Include the current element in the subset
    bt(ans, tmp, nums, idx + 1);  // Recurse with the current element included
    tmp.pop_back();  // Backtrack: remove the last added element
}
```

- **Base Case**: When `idx == nums.size()`, we've considered all elements. We check if the current subset `tmp` has already been added (using `mp.count(tmp)`). If it hasn't been added before, we push it to the result and mark it as added in the map.
  
- **Recursion**:
  - First, we call `bt(ans, tmp, nums, idx + 1)` to skip the current element and move on to the next.
  - Then, we add the current element `nums[idx]` to `tmp` and call `bt` again to consider this element as part of the current subset.
  - After that, we backtrack by removing the last element from `tmp` using `tmp.pop_back()` to try other subsets without the current element.

#### Step 3: Handling Duplicates

- The sorting step ensures that identical elements are adjacent.
- The map `mp` is used to track whether a specific subset (represented by a vector) has already been added to the result.
- The check `if(!mp.count(tmp))` ensures that no duplicate subsets are added.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the input array `nums` takes `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the input list.
- **Backtracking**: In the worst case, the algorithm generates all possible subsets, which is `O(2^n)`. For each subset, we check if it has been seen before using a map, which takes `O(k)` time (where `k` is the size of the subset). In the worst case, this could take up to `O(n)` time per subset.
  - Total time complexity: **O(n log n + 2^n * n)**

#### Space Complexity:
- **Result Storage**: The space required to store the final answer is proportional to the number of unique subsets, which is `O(2^n)` in the worst case.
- **Recursion Stack**: The recursion stack can grow to a depth of `n`, so the space complexity due to recursion is `O(n)`.
  - Total space complexity: **O(2^n + n)**

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently generates all unique subsets of the given list `nums` using backtracking, sorting, and a map to avoid duplicates. The time complexity of the solution is driven by the exponential number of possible subsets, while the space complexity accounts for the result and recursion stack. The approach is optimal for problems involving subsets and duplicate elements, and it ensures that no duplicate subsets are included in the final result. This solution is both time-efficient and space-efficient, making it well-suited for solving the problem of generating subsets with duplicates.
