### Problem Statement
Given a collection of integers `nums` that may contain duplicates, return all possible subsets (the power set) without any duplicate subsets.

### Approach
1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting `nums` to ensure that duplicates are adjacent. This allows us to handle duplicates efficiently.
2. **Backtracking with Memoization**:
   - Use a recursive backtracking function `bt` to generate all subsets.
   - Track each subset in a map `mp` to avoid duplicates.
   - For each index `idx`, decide whether to include or exclude `nums[idx]` in the current subset.
3. **End of Recursion**: When reaching the end of `nums`, check if the current subset `tmp` is unique using the map `mp`. If it is, add it to the result.
4. **Backtrack**: After exploring a choice, undo it (backtrack) by removing the last added element to explore further options.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: Sort `nums`, clear `mp`, and call `bt` with the initial subset `tmp` as empty.
2. **Recursive Choices**: At each index `idx`, make a recursive call to either include or exclude `nums[idx]` in `tmp`.
3. **Duplicate Check**: Before adding `tmp` to the answer, check if it has been seen using `mp`.
4. **Backtrack**: Revert changes to `tmp` after each recursive call to ensure all possible subsets are explored.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(2^n)\), since each element has two choices (include or exclude).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(2^n)\) for storing subsets in `ans`.
