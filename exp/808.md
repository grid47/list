### Problem Statement
Given two types of soup A and B, each with an initial volume `n`, the goal is to determine the probability that soup A will be served more than soup B when both soups are served in portions. Each serving can reduce the volumes of the soups in specific ways. 

### Approach
1. **Base Cases**:
   - If both soups are depleted (`a <= 0 && b <= 0`), the probability is `0.5`.
   - If only soup A is depleted (`a <= 0`), the probability is `1` (soup B is served).
   - If only soup B is depleted (`b <= 0`), the probability is `0` (soup A is served).

2. **Memoization**:
   - Use a 2D vector `mem` to store computed probabilities for combinations of remaining volumes of soup A (`a`) and B (`b`) to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - Define a function `f(int a, int b)` that computes the probability based on the current volumes:
     - Each recursive call considers four possible ways to serve the soups, adjusting their volumes accordingly:
       - Serve 4 units of A.
       - Serve 3 units of A and 1 unit of B.
       - Serve 2 units of A and 2 units of B.
       - Serve 1 unit of A and 3 units of B.
     - The result is averaged with a factor of `0.25` for each scenario.

4. **Initial Call**:
   - The main function `soupServings(int n)` checks if `n` is greater than `4800`. If so, return `1` (probability that soup A will be served more). Otherwise, call the recursive function `f` after normalizing `n`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to compute the probability.
    - `double soupServings(int n)`: The entry point for the probability calculation.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `n`: Initial volume of soup A and B.
      - **Returns**: A double representing the probability that soup A will be served more than soup B.
    - `double f(int a, int b)`: A helper function for recursive probability calculations.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `a`: Remaining volume of soup A.
        - `b`: Remaining volume of soup B.
      - **Returns**: A double representing the probability based on remaining volumes.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the volume of the soups, due to the memoization storing results for combinations of volumes.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2), for the memoization storage.
