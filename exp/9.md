### Problem Statement
Determine whether an integer `x` is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.

### Approach
Reverse the digits of the integer and compare the reversed number with the original. If they are the same, the integer is a palindrome.

### Code Walk-through
1. Check if `x` is negative:
   - If `x` is less than 0, return `false` since negative numbers cannot be palindromes.
2. Initialize `y` as the original integer and `z` as 0, which will hold the reversed number.
3. Reverse the integer:
   - Use a while loop that continues until `x` becomes 0:
     - Update `z` by multiplying it by 10 and adding the last digit of `x` (obtained using `x % 10`).
     - Remove the last digit from `x` by performing integer division by 10 (`x /= 10`).
4. Compare the original number (`y`) with the reversed number (`z`):
   - Return `true` if they are equal, otherwise return `false`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(\log_{10}(n))\) - where \(n\) is the absolute value of `x`, since we process each digit.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) - no additional space is used apart from a few variables.
