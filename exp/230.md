### Problem Statement
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the k-th smallest element in it.

### Approach
- **In-Order Traversal**: Utilize the properties of a BST where the in-order traversal yields elements in sorted order. 
- **Using a Stack**: Implement an iterative in-order traversal using a stack to avoid recursion:
  - Push nodes onto the stack until reaching the leftmost node.
  - Pop nodes from the stack, decrementing `k` each time until `k` reaches zero, which indicates the k-th smallest element.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function `kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int k)`**:
  - Initialize an empty stack `stk` and set a pointer `node` to `root`.
  - Use a while loop to traverse the tree:
    - If `node` is not null, push it onto the stack and move to its left child.
    - If `node` is null, pop the top node from the stack and decrement `k`.
    - If `k` equals zero, return the value of the current node (the k-th smallest element).
    - Move to the right child of the popped node.
  - If the traversal completes without finding the k-th element, return NULL (though this case typically shouldn't occur in a well-formed input).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(H + k)\), where \(H\) is the height of the tree. The algorithm may need to visit up to \(k\) nodes.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(H)\) for the stack space, where \(H\) is the height of the tree.
