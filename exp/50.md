### Problem Statement

The problem is to implement the `myPow` function, which calculates `x^n` (x raised to the power n) where `x` is a floating-point number and `n` is an integer. The function should be efficient and handle both positive and negative exponents as well as edge cases such as `n = 0`. 

Given a double `x` and an integer `n`, the task is to compute `x^n` without using built-in power functions.

### Approach

The problem requires an optimized way of calculating `x^n`, particularly since the direct approach of multiplying `x` repeatedly for `n` times would be inefficient, especially for large values of `n`. 

The key to solving this problem efficiently is to use **exponentiation by squaring**, which is a fast algorithm that reduces the time complexity from `O(n)` (linear) to `O(log n)` (logarithmic). This approach works by recursively breaking down the problem into smaller powers of `x`, utilizing the property that:

- **For even `n`:**  
  \( x^n = (x^{n/2})^2 \)
  
- **For odd `n`:**  
  \( x^n = x \times (x^{n/2})^2 \)
  
Additionally, we need to handle the case when `n` is negative, which can be transformed using the relation:
  
  \( x^{-n} = \frac{1}{x^n} \)

With this approach, we reduce the number of calculations required and make the algorithm significantly more efficient.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double myPow(double x, int n) {
        if(n == 0) return 1;  // Base case: x^0 = 1 for any x
        
        if(n < 0) return 1/x * myPow(1/x, -(n + 1));  // Handle negative exponents
        
        return (n % 2) ? x * myPow(x * x, n / 2) : myPow(x * x, n / 2);  // Apply exponentiation by squaring
    }
};
```

#### Step 1: Base Case for `n == 0`

```cpp
if (n == 0) return 1;
```

- **Why is this important?**
  By definition, any non-zero number raised to the power of `0` equals `1` (i.e., `x^0 = 1`). This is an essential base case for recursion, ensuring that the function terminates correctly when `n = 0`.

#### Step 2: Handling Negative Exponents

```cpp
if (n < 0) return 1 / x * myPow(1 / x, -(n + 1));
```

- **Why is this needed?**
  When `n` is negative, we can use the identity:
  
  \[
  x^{-n} = \frac{1}{x^n}
  \]
  
  The recursive call is adjusted for negative exponents. The key modification here is the change of `n` to `-(n + 1)` in the recursive call. This adjustment ensures that the correct result is computed without running into issues with integer overflow when `n` is the minimum possible integer (`INT_MIN`). The call essentially turns the negative exponent into a positive one, allowing the algorithm to proceed using the same logic.

#### Step 3: Exponentiation by Squaring (Recursive Case)

```cpp
return (n % 2) ? x * myPow(x * x, n / 2) : myPow(x * x, n / 2);
```

- **What is happening here?**
  The recursive case applies exponentiation by squaring:
  
  - **For even `n`:** The algorithm recursively computes `myPow(x * x, n / 2)` because `x^n = (x^{n/2})^2`. This reduces the size of the problem by half.
  
  - **For odd `n`:** The algorithm computes `myPow(x * x, n / 2)` first and then multiplies the result by `x` because `x^n = x * (x^{n/2})^2`. This handles the odd exponent by utilizing the square of the number and multiplying by `x` once more.
  
  The `(n % 2)` checks whether `n` is odd or even. If it's odd, we multiply the result by `x` after squaring; if it's even, we simply square `x` and divide `n` by 2.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this approach is **O(log n)**, where `n` is the exponent. This is because, in each recursive step, the problem size is reduced by half (either by dividing `n` by 2 or by recursively squaring `x`). This logarithmic behavior results in a logarithmic time complexity, which is highly efficient compared to the naive approach of iterating `n` times.

- **Why `log n`?**
  Since we are halving `n` at each recursive step, the number of recursive calls required is proportional to the logarithm of `n` with base 2, i.e., `log(n)`.

#### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is **O(log n)** due to the recursive call stack. Each recursive call requires constant space, but the depth of the recursion is proportional to `log(n)` since the value of `n` is halved in each step.

- **Why `log n`?**
  The recursion depth is determined by how many times `n` can be divided by 2, which takes `log(n)` steps.

### Conclusion

This implementation of the `myPow` function efficiently computes `x^n` using the method of **exponentiation by squaring**, which reduces the time complexity from `O(n)` to `O(log n)`. The function correctly handles both positive and negative exponents and includes a base case for when `n == 0`. The recursive approach ensures that even large values of `n` are processed quickly, making this solution highly efficient for a wide range of input sizes.

- **Advantages of this approach:**
  - **Efficiency:** By reducing the problem size logarithmically, it ensures that the function runs in a reasonable time even for large exponents.
  - **Simplicity:** The recursive structure is simple to understand and implement.
  - **Handles negative exponents:** The solution works seamlessly for negative exponents, returning the correct result without requiring additional logic.

In summary, this code provides an optimized solution for calculating powers, combining mathematical insights with efficient algorithmic design. It is a good choice for solving problems involving powers, especially when dealing with large exponents.
