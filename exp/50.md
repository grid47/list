### Problem Statement
Implement a function to calculate \( x \) raised to the power of \( n \) (i.e., \( x^n \)) where \( x \) is a floating-point number and \( n \) is an integer.

### Approach
1. **Base Cases**:
   - If \( n \) is 0, return 1 (since any number to the power of 0 is 1).
   - If \( n \) is negative, convert the problem to \( \frac{1}{x^{-n}} \).

2. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - For positive \( n \):
     - If \( n \) is odd, calculate \( x \times \text{myPow}(x^2, \frac{n}{2}) \).
     - If \( n \) is even, calculate \( \text{myPow}(x^2, \frac{n}{2}) \).

3. **Efficient Exponentiation**:
   - The method reduces the number of multiplications by squaring the base and halving the exponent, leading to a logarithmic time complexity.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function `myPow`**:
   - Takes two parameters: a double \( x \) and an integer \( n \).
   - Checks for the base case when \( n = 0 \).
   - Handles the case when \( n < 0 \) by adjusting \( x \) and negating \( n \).
   - Uses recursion to calculate the power based on whether \( n \) is odd or even.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(\log n) \), due to the halving of \( n \) with each recursive call.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(\log n) \) for the recursion stack in the worst case.
