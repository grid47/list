### Problem Statement
The task is to find the shortest path to collect all keys in a grid while navigating through walls and locked doors. The grid consists of open spaces, walls, keys (lowercase letters), locked doors (uppercase letters), and a starting position represented by '@'.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Determine the dimensions of the grid and initialize variables.
   - Count the total number of keys (`K`) present in the grid.
   - Use a queue to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) and a 3D vector to keep track of visited states defined by the position in the grid and the keys collected.

2. **BFS for Pathfinding**:
   - Start BFS from the initial position '@' with an initial key state of 0 (no keys collected).
   - For each position, check all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
   - If the next position is a key, update the key state using a bitmask to indicate which keys have been collected.
   - If the next position is a locked door, ensure the corresponding key has been collected before moving through.
   - Add valid and unvisited states to the queue for further exploration.

3. **Key Collection Check**:
   - After processing all positions at the current path length, check if all keys have been collected by comparing the current key state with the bitmask representing all keys collected.

4. **Return Result**:
   - If all keys are collected, return the path length; otherwise, if the queue is exhausted without collecting all keys, return -1.

### Code Walk-through
- The BFS loop processes each node while managing the current position and collected keys.
- Each direction is checked for walls, keys, and doors.
- The key state is managed using bitwise operations for efficiency.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n * 2^K), where `m` is the number of rows, `n` is the number of columns, and `K` is the number of keys. Each state can be visited once per possible key combination.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n * 2^K) for the visited states and the queue.
