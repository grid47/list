### Problem Statement
In a row of houses, each house has a certain amount of money hidden. The robber cannot rob two adjacent houses, as it will alert the police. Given that the houses are arranged in a circle, the robber cannot rob the first and last house simultaneously. The task is to find the maximum amount of money the robber can rob.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to each house.
   
2. **Two Scenarios**:
   - **Case 1**: Consider the scenario where the first house is robbed but the last house is not.
   - **Case 2**: Consider the scenario where the last house is robbed but the first house is not.
   
3. **Dynamic Programming Array**:
   - Initialize a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the first `i` houses.
   - For each scenario, fill the `dp` array based on the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = \max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + \text{nums}[i - 1])
     \]
   - This means at house `i`, the robber can either:
     - Skip the house and take the maximum from the previous house.
     - Rob the current house and add its value to the maximum from two houses back.

4. **Final Result**: Return the maximum value between the two scenarios.

### Code Walk-through
- **rob**: The main function that calculates the maximum money that can be robbed:
  - If there's only one house, return its value directly.
  - For the first scenario, create a `dp` array for houses from `0` to `n-2`.
  - For the second scenario, resize the `dp` array to handle the houses from `1` to `n-1`.
  - Calculate the maximum robbed amount for both scenarios and return the maximum of the two.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of houses, as the algorithm traverses the list of houses twice.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) due to the use of the `dp` array, which stores the maximum amounts for each house.
