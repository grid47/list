### Problem Statement

The problem involves finding the minimum cost to cut a stick of length `n` at specified positions given by the array `cuts`. The cost of making a cut is equal to the length of the stick being cut. The objective is to determine the order of cuts that minimizes the total cost.

### Approach

To solve the problem, we will employ a dynamic programming approach. The core idea is to consider each segment of the stick defined by the cut positions and recursively calculate the minimum cost of cutting that segment. 

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We create a 2D DP table `dp[i][j]`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to cut the stick between the positions `cuts[i]` and `cuts[j]`. If there are no cuts between these two positions, the cost is zero.

2. **Recursive Function**: The recursive function `func(i, j)` computes the minimum cost for the segment defined by cuts at indices `i` and `j`. If there are no cuts to be made in this segment (i.e., `j - i <= 1`), it returns zero.

3. **Cost Calculation**: For each segment defined by indices `i` and `j`, we iterate through possible cut positions `k` between `i` and `j`. The cost of cutting at position `k` is calculated as the length of the segment `cuts[j] - cuts[i]` plus the costs of recursively cutting the left segment from `i` to `k` and the right segment from `k` to `j`.

4. **Memoization**: To avoid redundant calculations, the results of computed states are stored in the DP table. If the state `dp[i][j]` has already been calculated, it is returned directly.

5. **Initialization**: Before calling the recursive function, the `cuts` array is modified to include the starting point (0) and the end point (n), and is sorted to ensure the cut positions are in ascending order.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> cut; // Step 1: Vector to hold the cut positions
    int dp[102][102] = {}; // Step 2: DP table to store minimum costs
    
    int func(int i, int j) { // Step 3: Recursive function to calculate minimum cost
        if(j - i <= 1) return 0; // Step 4: Base case, no cuts needed
        
        if(!dp[i][j]) { // Step 5: Check if the result is already calculated
            dp[i][j] = INT_MAX; // Step 6: Initialize to maximum value
            for(int k = i + 1; k < j; k++) { // Step 7: Try every possible cut
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], cut[j] - cut[i] + func(i, k) + func(k, j)); // Step 8: Update minimum cost
            }
        }
        return dp[i][j]; // Step 9: Return the minimum cost for segment
    }
    
    int minCost(int n, vector<int>& cuts) { // Step 10: Main function to find minimum cost
        cuts.push_back(0); // Step 11: Add the starting point
        cuts.push_back(n); // Step 12: Add the ending point
        
        sort(cuts.begin(), cuts.end()); // Step 13: Sort the cuts
        cut = cuts; // Step 14: Store the cuts
        
        return func(0, cuts.size() - 1); // Step 15: Call the recursive function for the whole stick
    }
};
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Data Structures**:
   - `vector<int> cut`: This vector will store the adjusted cut positions including the start and end of the stick.
   - `int dp[102][102]`: A 2D array to store the minimum cost of making cuts between any two indices.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - The function `func(int i, int j)` computes the minimum cost of cutting the stick between the indices `i` and `j`. If `j - i <= 1`, meaning there are no cuts between the two indices, it returns `0`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - If `dp[i][j]` is not already calculated (i.e., it is `0`), it is initialized to `INT_MAX` to ensure any found minimum will replace this initial value.
   - A loop iterates through possible cut positions `k` from `i + 1` to `j - 1`. For each `k`, the cost of making that cut is calculated as:
     - The length of the current segment: `cuts[j] - cuts[i]`
     - Plus the cost of recursively cutting the left segment (`func(i, k)`)
     - Plus the cost of recursively cutting the right segment (`func(k, j)`).
   - The minimum of all these possible cuts is stored in `dp[i][j]`.

4. **Initialization of the Cuts**:
   - Before invoking the `func`, the starting point `0` and the ending point `n` are added to the `cuts` vector.
   - The vector is sorted to ensure that cuts are in ascending order.

5. **Final Call**:
   - The function `func(0, cuts.size() - 1)` is called, which calculates the minimum cost for cutting the entire stick from position `0` to `n`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(m^3)\), where \(m\) is the number of cuts. This is due to the nested loops iterating through cuts and the recursive calls to calculate costs.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is \(O(m^2)\) because of the DP table used to store minimum costs.

### Conclusion

The provided solution efficiently computes the minimum cost of making cuts on a stick of length `n` by employing dynamic programming. 

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Dynamic Programming**: The use of DP allows for a structured approach to solving optimization problems involving cuts or segments.
- **Recursive Cost Calculation**: By breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems, the solution leverages recursion effectively.
- **Memoization**: Storing results in a DP table reduces redundant calculations and speeds up the overall process.

This implementation is a clear example of how to approach optimization problems with constraints using dynamic programming and recursion, making it a valuable strategy for similar algorithmic challenges.
