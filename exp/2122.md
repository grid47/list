### Problem Statement

The problem requires us to determine whether a given string consists solely of characters 'a' followed by characters 'b'. Specifically, we need to check if there are any occurrences of the substring "ba" within the string. If the substring "ba" is present, it indicates that there are 'b' characters that precede 'a' characters, which violates the condition. The goal is to return `true` if the string adheres to this pattern and `false` otherwise.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we will utilize the `find` function available in the C++ Standard Library's `string` class. This function allows us to search for a substring within a given string efficiently. The approach can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **Check for Substring**: We will check for the presence of the substring "ba" in the input string using the `find` method.
2. **Return Result**: If the substring is found, we will return `false`; otherwise, we will return `true`.

This straightforward method efficiently determines if the string is valid based on the specified criteria.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the code implementation:

1. **Class Declaration**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
   ```
   - The class `Solution` is defined, which will contain the method to check the string.

2. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   bool checkString(string s) {
   ```
   - The public member function `checkString` is declared, which takes a single argument `s` of type `string`. It returns a boolean value.

3. **Finding the Substring**:
   ```cpp
   return s.find("ba") == string::npos;
   ```
   - This line uses the `find` method to search for the substring "ba" within the string `s`.
   - The `find` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring if it is found, or `string::npos` (which is a constant representing a non-existent position) if it is not found.
   - The expression checks if the result of `find` is equal to `string::npos`. If it is, it means that "ba" is not present in the string, and thus the string is valid according to our conditions.

4. **End of Class**:
   ```cpp
   };
   ```
   - This curly brace marks the end of the `Solution` class definition.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - The `find` method performs a linear search through the string, resulting in a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - The space complexity is constant \(O(1)\) since we are not using any additional data structures that grow with the size of the input string.

### Conclusion

The `checkString` function efficiently determines whether the input string consists solely of 'a' characters followed by 'b' characters by checking for the presence of the substring "ba". The use of the `find` method provides a clean and efficient solution to the problem. The function's time complexity is linear with respect to the input string length, ensuring quick execution even for longer strings. This implementation highlights the effectiveness of leveraging built-in string functions to achieve common string manipulation tasks in a straightforward manner.

Overall, this approach not only adheres to the problem's requirements but also showcases a clear and maintainable coding style, making it easier for future developers to understand and extend if needed. The solution is robust and handles edge cases gracefully, ensuring that the function works as intended for a wide range of inputs.
