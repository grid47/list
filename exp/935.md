### Problem Statement
Given a phone keypad represented as a 4x3 grid (where the last row has only one digit), the goal is to find the number of distinct phone numbers that can be dialed by a knight in `n` moves, starting from any digit on the keypad. The knight can jump to digits that are valid moves according to its movement pattern.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
   - Use a 3D array to store the results of subproblems, where `mem[n][i][j]` represents the number of distinct phone numbers that can be formed starting from the digit at position `(i, j)` with `n` moves left.
   - If the knight reaches an invalid position (like moving out of the keypad or onto the "0" in the last row), return 0.
   - If only one move remains (`n == 1`), return 1 because the current position itself counts as a valid number.

2. **Recursive Path Calculation**:
   - For each digit `(i, j)`, calculate the total distinct numbers formed by making a knight's move to valid positions and summing the results recursively for `n - 1` moves.
   - Utilize memoization to avoid redundant calculations for previously computed positions.

### Code Walk-through
- **`knightDialer` Function**:
  - Initializes the result and sets up a memoization table.
  - Iterates over all possible starting positions on the keypad and aggregates results from the `path` function.
  
- **`path` Function**:
  - Implements the recursive logic to explore all valid knight moves from the current position `(i, j)` for `n` moves.
  - Uses bounds checking to ensure valid movements within the keypad.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * 4 * 3) where `n` is the number of moves, since for each move the function checks 8 possible positions on the keypad.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * 4 * 3) for the memoization table that stores results for each position and number of moves.
