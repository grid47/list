### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, find the maximum possible sum of a non-empty subarray of the array. The subarray may wrap around the end of the array (circular).

### Approach
1. **Initial Variables**:
   - Initialize variables `lmax`, `lmin`, `gmax`, and `gmin` to keep track of the current maximum and minimum subarray sums and the global maximum and minimum sums, respectively.
   - Initialize `sum` to hold the total sum of the array.

2. **Iterate Through Array**:
   - Loop through each element in `nums`, updating the following:
     - `lmax`: The maximum subarray sum ending at the current position.
     - `gmax`: The global maximum subarray sum found so far.
     - `lmin`: The minimum subarray sum ending at the current position.
     - `gmin`: The global minimum subarray sum found so far.
     - `sum`: Accumulate the total sum of the array.

3. **Calculate Result**:
   - If `gmax` is greater than 0, return the maximum of `gmax` and `sum - gmin` (which accounts for wrapping around).
   - If `gmax` is not greater than 0, simply return `gmax`.

### Code Walk-through
- The code iteratively calculates local maximum and minimum subarray sums while keeping track of the global sums and the total array sum.
- The final result is derived from either the maximum subarray sum found directly or the circular sum derived by subtracting the minimum subarray sum from the total.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`, as it requires a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only a constant amount of additional space is used for the variables.
