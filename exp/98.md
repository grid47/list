### Problem Statement

The problem asks to determine if a given binary tree is a **valid binary search tree (BST)**. A **binary search tree** is a binary tree where for each node:
- The value of the node must be greater than all the values in its left subtree.
- The value of the node must be less than all the values in its right subtree.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Given a binary tree, we need to check if it satisfies the above conditions. The task is to implement a function that verifies if a binary tree is a valid BST.

### Approach

This problem can be solved using **in-order traversal** of the tree. In an **in-order traversal**, the nodes are visited in the following order:
1. Traverse the left subtree.
2. Visit the current node.
3. Traverse the right subtree.

For a **valid BST**, during an in-order traversal, the nodes must be visited in strictly increasing order (i.e., each node’s value should be greater than the previous node’s value).

The approach is as follows:
1. Perform an in-order traversal of the tree, starting from the root node.
2. As we traverse, keep track of the previously visited node. If we encounter a node whose value is not greater than the value of the previous node, we can immediately conclude that the tree is not a valid BST.
3. Use a **stack** to simulate the recursive in-order traversal iteratively, avoiding the overhead of recursion and making the algorithm more efficient in terms of space usage.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. Class Definition and Initial Setup

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        stack<TreeNode*> stk;
        TreeNode* node = root, *prv = NULL;
```

- A `stack` `stk` is used to help with the iterative in-order traversal.
- `node` is initialized to `root` and is used to traverse the tree.
- `prv` is a pointer to the previous node, initialized to `NULL`. It will store the previous node’s value to compare with the current node’s value.

#### 2. Iterative In-Order Traversal

```cpp
        while(!stk.empty() || node) {
            if(node) {
                stk.push(node);
                node = node->left;
            } else {
                node = stk.top();
                stk.pop();
```

- The loop continues as long as there are nodes to process (`stk` is not empty) or there is a node to traverse (`node` is not `NULL`).
- If `node` is not `NULL`, push it onto the stack and move to its left child (`node = node->left`).
- If `node` is `NULL`, pop the top node from the stack, which is the current node in the in-order traversal.

#### 3. Validity Check and Node Traversal

```cpp
                if(prv != NULL && prv -> val >= node->val)
                    return false;
                prv = node;
                node = node->right;
            }
        }
```

- If `prv` is not `NULL`, it means we have previously visited a node. At this point, compare the value of the `prv` node with the value of the current `node`. If the value of the `prv` node is greater than or equal to the value of the current node, the tree is not a valid BST, so return `false`.
- If the values are in the correct order, update `prv` to the current node and proceed to traverse the right child of the current node (`node = node->right`).

#### 4. Conclusion

```cpp
        return true;
    }
};
```

- If the loop completes without encountering any violations of the BST properties, return `true`, indicating that the tree is a valid BST.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the algorithm is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because in the worst case, we visit each node once during the in-order traversal.

#### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree. This space is used by the stack, which stores nodes during the traversal. In the worst case (for an unbalanced tree), the height `h` could be equal to `n`, resulting in a space complexity of **O(n)**. However, for a balanced tree, the space complexity would be **O(log n)**.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently checks whether a binary tree is a valid binary search tree using an **iterative in-order traversal**. By leveraging a stack to simulate the recursion and maintaining a reference to the previous node, the algorithm ensures that the tree’s values are visited in the correct order and verifies the BST property in **O(n)** time. The space complexity is optimized to **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree. This approach avoids the overhead of recursion and provides a space-efficient solution for validating a binary search tree.
