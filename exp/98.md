### Problem Statement
Determine if a given binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST). A BST is valid if, for every node, its left subtree values are less than the node value, and its right subtree values are greater than the node value.

### Approach
This solution uses an **iterative in-order traversal**:
1. **In-order Traversal with a Stack**:
   - Perform an in-order traversal, which visits nodes in ascending order if the tree is a valid BST.
   - Use a stack to simulate the traversal without recursion.
2. **Check BST Validity**:
   - Track the previous node (`prv`). For each visited node, check if its value is greater than the previous node.
   - If any node is not greater than the previous node, the tree is not a BST.
3. **Edge Case**:
   - If the tree is empty, it is considered a valid BST.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialize Stack and Pointers**: Use `stk` for iterative traversal, `node` as the current node, and `prv` to store the last visited node.
2. **Traverse Left Subtree**: Push nodes onto `stk` until reaching the leftmost node.
3. **Visit and Compare**:
   - Pop from `stk`, visit the node, and compare it with `prv`.
   - If `prv->val >= node->val`, return `false` as this violates BST properties.
4. **Update Previous**: Set `prv` to the current node and move to the right subtree.
5. **Return**: If all nodes are in order, return `true`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree, for the stack in the worst case (unbalanced tree).
