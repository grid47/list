### üöÄ Problem Statement

In this problem, we are tasked with finding the largest subset of a given array of integers such that for every pair of integers `a` and `b` in the subset, either `a` divides `b` or `b` divides `a`. The goal is to return this largest divisible subset from the array. Let‚Äôs break it down and find the most efficient way to solve this!

### üß† Key Insights

- A **divisible subset** consists of elements where every pair of elements satisfies the divisibility condition. That is, for any two elements `a` and `b`, either `a` divides `b` or `b` divides `a`.
- Sorting the array helps to easily check the divisibility condition in increasing order.
- The **dynamic programming (DP)** approach is a powerful technique to solve this efficiently. By iterating over the sorted array, we can track the largest divisible subset for each element.

### üõ†Ô∏è Approach

Let‚Äôs walk through how we can solve this problem using dynamic programming:

1. **Sorting**:
   - We begin by sorting the array in ascending order. This makes it easier to check the divisibility condition: once sorted, any valid subset will have elements in increasing order.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - We maintain a DP table where each entry `dp[i]` will store:
     - `dp[i][0]`: The size of the largest divisible subset that ends at element `i`.
     - `dp[i][1]`: The index of the next element in the subset (this helps us reconstruct the subset later).
   
3. **Constructing the Result**:
   - After processing the elements, we find the maximum size of the divisible subsets and then trace back to identify the elements that form this largest subset.

### üî® Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

#### Step 1: Initial Setup and Sorting
```cpp
if(nums.size() == 0) return nums;
sort(nums.begin(), nums.end()); 
```
- First, we check if the input array `nums` is empty. If it is, we simply return the empty array because no subset can be formed.
- We then sort the array in ascending order to make checking divisibility easier.

---

#### Step 2: DP Initialization
```cpp
int n = nums.size();
vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(2, 0));
```
- We initialize the DP table with `n` rows (one for each element of the array). Each row has two columns:
  - `dp[i][0]`: The size of the largest divisible subset ending at element `i`.
  - `dp[i][1]`: The index of the next element in the subset (for later reconstruction).

---

#### Step 3: Filling the DP Table
```cpp
for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    dp[i][0] = 0;
    dp[i][1] = i;
    for(int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
        if((nums[j] % nums[i]) == 0) {
            if(dp[i][0] < dp[j][0]) {
                dp[i][0] = dp[j][0];
                dp[i][1] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    dp[i][0]++;
}
```
- For each element `nums[i]`, we initialize the size of the largest divisible subset at `i` as `0` and set `dp[i][1]` to `i` (i.e., the next element is initially itself).
- We then check each subsequent element `nums[j]` (where `j > i`) to see if `nums[j] % nums[i] == 0`. If true, it means `nums[i]` divides `nums[j]`.
- If the subset ending at `i` is smaller than the subset ending at `j`, we update `dp[i][0]` and set `dp[i][1]` to `j` (indicating that the next element in the subset is `nums[j]`).
- Finally, we increment `dp[i][0]` by 1 to account for `nums[i]` itself.

---

#### Step 4: Finding the Maximum Divisible Subset
```cpp
int mx = 0, mxi = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if(mx <= dp[i][0]) {
        mxi = i;
        mx = dp[i][0];
    }
}
```
- We then find the largest divisible subset by checking which entry in the DP table has the maximum size (`dp[i][0]`).
- We keep track of both the size of the largest subset (`mx`) and the index (`mxi`) where this subset ends.

---

#### Step 5: Reconstructing the Subset
```cpp
vector<int> ans;
int i = mxi;
ans.push_back(nums[i]);
while(dp[i][1] != i) {
    i = dp[i][1];
    ans.push_back(nums[i]);
}
```
- Now, we reconstruct the largest divisible subset. Starting from the index `mxi`, we add `nums[i]` to the result vector `ans`.
- We then follow the `dp[i][1]` (the index of the next element in the subset) until we reach the end of the subset.

---

#### Step 6: Return the Result
```cpp
return ans;
```
- Finally, we return the reconstructed largest divisible subset.

### üìà Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n^2)**, where `n` is the size of the input array. This is because for each element `i`, we check every subsequent element `j` to determine divisibility. Thus, there are `O(n^2)` checks in total.

- Sorting the array takes **O(n log n)** time.
- Filling the DP table involves a double loop over the array, which takes **O(n^2)** time.

So, the overall time complexity is dominated by the **O(n^2)** term.

---

### üí° Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(n)** because:
- We store the DP table, which has `n` rows and 2 columns.
- We store the final result in a vector of size `n`.

---

### üèÅ Conclusion

This solution efficiently finds the largest divisible subset using dynamic programming. By sorting the array and using a DP table to track the largest subset for each element, we can solve the problem in **O(n^2)** time, which is manageable for typical input sizes. The space complexity is **O(n)**, making the solution both time-efficient and space-efficient.
