### Problem Statement
Given a set of positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair of elements in the subset is divisible by each other.

### Approach
1. **Sorting**:
   - First, sort the input array to ensure that if a number divides another, it will appear before it in the sorted order.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Use a 2D vector `dp` where:
     - `dp[i][0]` holds the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`.
     - `dp[i][1]` holds the index of the next number in the subset.
   - Initialize `dp[i][0]` to `0` and `dp[i][1]` to `i` for each element.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Iterate through the list in reverse:
     - For each number `nums[i]`, check all subsequent numbers `nums[j]`:
       - If `nums[j] % nums[i] == 0`, update `dp[i][0]` and `dp[i][1]` if the current count is less than the one ending at `j`.

4. **Finding the Maximum Subset**:
   - Iterate through `dp` to find the maximum size of any divisible subset.
   - Trace back using the `dp` table to construct the largest divisible subset.

5. **Result Construction**:
   - Start from the index of the largest subset and keep adding elements to the result until reaching back to the starting element.

### Code Walk-through
- The main function `largestDivisibleSubset` first checks if the input array is empty.
- It sorts the input array and initializes the DP table.
- It iterates to fill in the DP table based on the divisibility condition.
- Finally, it identifies the largest divisible subset and constructs the result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \) due to the nested loops for filling the DP table.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) for the DP table and result storage.
