### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest palindrome that can be formed by rearranging the characters in `s`. A palindrome reads the same forward and backward.

### Approach
1. **Character Count**: Use a map to count the occurrences of each character in the string.
2. **Calculate Maximum Length**:
   - Initialize a variable `res` to store the length of the longest palindrome and a boolean `odd` to track if any character has an odd count.
   - Iterate through the character count map:
     - For each character, if its count is odd, set `odd` to `true`.
     - Add the largest even number less than or equal to the character count to `res` (which is calculated as `(val / 2) * 2`).
3. **Final Adjustment**: If there is at least one character with an odd count, increment `res` by 1 to account for the center character of the palindrome.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Counting Characters**: A loop iterates through each character in the string `s` and populates the map `mp` with character counts.
2. **Building the Result**: A second loop goes through the entries in `mp`, updating `res` with even counts and checking for odd counts.
3. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the function returns `res`, adding 1 if there was an odd count, allowing for a single central character in the palindrome.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the map can contain at most 26 characters (assuming only lowercase English letters), making the space usage constant.
