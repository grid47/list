### Problem Statement
The goal is to sort each diagonal of a given 2D matrix in ascending order. A diagonal in a matrix consists of elements that share the same difference between their row and column indices. For example, the elements at positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) form a diagonal, and those at (0,1), (1,2) form another. The output should be the same matrix structure but with each diagonal sorted in ascending order.

### Approach
The solution utilizes a mapping of diagonals to a min-heap (priority queue) for efficient sorting:
1. **Mapping Diagonals**: Each diagonal can be identified by the difference \(i - j\) between its row index \(i\) and column index \(j\). This difference acts as a unique key for each diagonal.

2. **Storing Elements**: A map is used to store each diagonal's elements in a min-heap, which allows for automatic sorting when elements are inserted.

3. **Rebuilding the Matrix**: After all elements are stored, the matrix is rebuilt by extracting the smallest elements from the min-heaps, ensuring each diagonal is filled with its sorted elements.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> diagonalSort(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int m = mat.size(), n = mat[0].size();
```
- The `diagonalSort` function is defined within the `Solution` class. It takes a 2D vector `mat` as input, representing the matrix to be sorted. The dimensions of the matrix, `m` (number of rows) and `n` (number of columns), are determined.

```cpp
        map<int, priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>>> mp;
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
        for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            mp[i-j].push(mat[i][j]);
```
- A map `mp` is created, where the key is the diagonal index (the difference \(i - j\)), and the value is a min-heap (implemented as a priority queue) containing the elements of that diagonal.
- Two nested loops iterate through each element of the matrix. The element `mat[i][j]` is pushed into the corresponding min-heap based on its diagonal index.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
        for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            mat[i][j] = mp[i-j].top();
            mp[i-j].pop();
        }
```
- The next two nested loops traverse the matrix again. For each element, the top element of the corresponding min-heap is retrieved (which is the smallest element due to the properties of the min-heap) and assigned to `mat[i][j]`.
- After assigning the value, the top element is popped from the heap to prepare for the next assignment.

```cpp
        return mat;
    }
};
```
- Finally, the modified matrix `mat` is returned, now with each diagonal sorted in ascending order.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The overall time complexity is \(O(m \cdot n \cdot \log(k))\), where \(k\) is the maximum number of elements in any diagonal. This complexity arises because each element is inserted and removed from the min-heap, and operations on a min-heap take \(O(\log(k))\).
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(k)\) for storing the elements of the diagonals in the min-heaps, where \(k\) is the number of elements in the largest diagonal.

### Conclusion
The provided code efficiently sorts each diagonal of a matrix by utilizing a combination of maps and priority queues. This approach not only ensures that each diagonal's elements are sorted in ascending order but also maintains the original structure of the matrix. The solution is both elegant and effective, making it an excellent example of applying data structures to solve a problem involving sorting.

In practical applications, understanding how to manipulate matrices and leverage advanced data structures like priority queues can greatly enhance the performance of algorithms. This solution serves as a valuable reference for tackling similar problems that involve sorting and managing collections of data within specified constraints. 

Overall, mastering such techniques is essential for anyone looking to excel in competitive programming or software development, where efficient data handling is often a key requirement.
