### Problem Statement
The goal is to create a `Cashier` class that simulates a cashier system in a store. The cashier must handle billing for customers, applying a discount after every `n` transactions. The following features should be implemented:
1. **Product Management**: The cashier should store a list of products and their corresponding prices.
2. **Bill Calculation**: When a customer checks out, the cashier should calculate the total bill based on the products purchased and their quantities.
3. **Discount Application**: If the cashier has processed exactly `n` transactions, a discount should be applied to the current bill.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: The `Cashier` class is initialized with the total number of transactions (`n`), a discount percentage, a list of products, and their corresponding prices. During initialization, a mapping of products to prices is created using an unordered map for quick lookups.
2. **Bill Calculation**: The `getBill` method takes two vectors: one for the products purchased and another for their respective quantities. It calculates the total cost based on these inputs.
3. **Discount Logic**: After every transaction, a counter (`cnt`) keeps track of the number of transactions. If `cnt` is a multiple of `n`, the discount is applied; otherwise, the full price is charged.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Cashier {
    int cnt, mod;  // Counter for transactions and the limit for discount
    double pct;    // Percentage to apply after discount
    unordered_map<int, int> tags; // Maps product IDs to prices
public:
    // Constructor to initialize the Cashier
    Cashier(int n, int discount, vector<int>& products, vector<int>& prices) {
        cnt = 0; // Initialize transaction count
        mod = n; // Set the number of transactions for discount application
        pct = (100 - discount) / 100.0; // Calculate the discount percentage

        // Map products to their prices
        for(int i = 0; i < products.size(); i++)
            tags[products[i]] = prices[i];
    }
    
    // Method to calculate the bill
    double getBill(vector<int> product, vector<int> amount) {
        cnt++; // Increment the transaction counter
        int ans = 0; // Variable to store total price

        // Calculate total price based on product and amount
        for(int i = 0; i < product.size(); i++)
            ans += tags[product[i]] * amount[i];
        
        // Apply discount if the transaction count is a multiple of mod
        return cnt % mod ? ans : ans * pct; 
    }
};
```

1. **Class Definition**: The `Cashier` class contains member variables for tracking the transaction count (`cnt`), the modulo for applying discounts (`mod`), and the discount percentage (`pct`). It also has an unordered map (`tags`) to store product prices.
   
2. **Constructor**: The constructor takes four parameters: the maximum number of transactions before applying a discount (`n`), the discount percentage, and vectors for product IDs and their prices. It initializes the `tags` map for quick access to product prices.

3. **getBill Method**: This method accepts two vectors: `product` (product IDs purchased) and `amount` (quantities purchased). It increments the transaction counter and computes the total cost. 
   - If the transaction count (`cnt`) is a multiple of `mod`, the discount percentage (`pct`) is applied to the total; otherwise, the full total is returned.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Initialization**: The constructor has a time complexity of \(O(p)\), where \(p\) is the number of products since it iterates through the list of products to populate the `tags` map.
  - **getBill**: This method has a time complexity of \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of products purchased in the transaction. It iterates through the `product` vector to compute the total cost.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(p)\) due to the storage of product-price pairs in the `tags` map.

### Conclusion
The `Cashier` class effectively simulates a cashier's behavior in a store, handling product sales and applying discounts after every `n` transactions. By using an unordered map to manage product prices, the implementation allows for efficient lookups, ensuring that bill calculations are performed quickly and accurately.

This implementation is particularly useful in e-commerce and retail environments, where efficient billing systems are essential. Understanding this code provides insights into object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms necessary for building practical applications in software development.
