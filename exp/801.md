### Problem Statement
In this problem, you are given two arrays of integers, `n1` and `n2`, each of size `n`. The goal is to transform the two arrays into strictly increasing sequences with the fewest number of swaps. A swap involves exchanging the corresponding elements of `n1` and `n2`. The objective is to return the minimum number of swaps required to achieve this transformation.

**Constraints:**
- A sequence is strictly increasing if each element is greater than the previous one.
- You can swap the elements `n1[i]` and `n2[i]` for each index `i`.
- The solution should aim for the least number of swaps required.

### Approach
This problem is an optimization problem that can be solved using dynamic programming (DP). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Key Insight:**
   At each index `i`, we have two choices:
   - Keep both elements in their respective arrays (`n1[i]` in `n1` and `n2[i]` in `n2`).
   - Swap the elements (`n1[i]` with `n2[i]`).

2. **Dynamic Programming Array:**
   We maintain a DP array `res[i][0]` and `res[i][1]` where:
   - `res[i][0]`: Minimum swaps needed if both `n1[i]` and `n2[i]` are not swapped.
   - `res[i][1]`: Minimum swaps needed if `n1[i]` and `n2[i]` are swapped.

   The recurrence relation will depend on whether the elements can form strictly increasing sequences or not.

3. **Decision Making:**
   For each index `i`, the decision involves:
   - Checking if both elements in their original positions are strictly increasing.
   - Checking if swapping the elements makes the sequence strictly increasing.
   
   Based on these conditions, we will update the DP table by choosing the minimum number of swaps required.

4. **Base Case:**
   For the first index `i = 0`, we initialize:
   - `res[0][0] = 0`: No swap is required for the first element in its original position.
   - `res[0][1] = 1`: One swap is required if we swap the first element.

5. **Final Answer:**
   The final result will be the minimum of `res[n - 1][0]` and `res[n - 1][1]`, which represents the minimum number of swaps needed to transform both arrays into strictly increasing sequences.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)
Let's walk through the provided code and understand how the approach is implemented:

#### Step 1: Initialization
The size of the input arrays is determined:
```cpp
int n = n1.size();
```
Next, a DP table `res` of size `n x 2` is created to store the results for both scenarios (with or without a swap):
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> res(n, vector<int>(2, 0));
```
We then initialize the base case for the first element:
```cpp
res[0][0] = 0;  // No swap needed for the first element
res[0][1] = 1;  // One swap needed if we swap the first element
```

#### Step 2: Iterating Through the Arrays
We now loop through the arrays starting from index `i = 1`:
```cpp
for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
```
For each index, we calculate two boolean conditions:
- `bothInc`: This checks if both `n1[i]` and `n2[i]` can be in their original positions and still form an increasing sequence.
- `crossInc`: This checks if swapping `n1[i]` and `n2[i]` results in a valid increasing sequence.

These two conditions are evaluated as follows:
```cpp
bool bothInc = n1[i - 1] < n1[i] && n2[i - 1] < n2[i];
bool crossInc = n1[i - 1] < n2[i] && n2[i - 1] < n1[i];
```

#### Step 3: Updating the DP Table
Based on these conditions, we update the DP table:
1. **If both conditions are true (both sequences are valid without swapping and with swapping),** we take the minimum swaps from the previous element (either from the same state or swapped state) and add 1 swap for the swapped state.
   ```cpp
   if(bothInc && crossInc) {
       res[i][0] = min(res[i - 1][0], res[i - 1][1]);
       res[i][1] = min(res[i - 1][0], res[i - 1][1]) + 1;
   }
   ```

2. **If only the `bothInc` condition is true (valid without swapping),** we retain the minimum swaps without a swap and increment the swap count when we do a swap:
   ```cpp
   else if(bothInc) {
       res[i][0] = res[i - 1][0];
       res[i][1] = res[i - 1][1] + 1;
   }
   ```

3. **If only the `crossInc` condition is true (valid with swapping),** we update the states accordingly:
   ```cpp
   else {
       res[i][0] = res[i - 1][1];
       res[i][1] = res[i - 1][0] + 1;
   }
   ```

#### Step 4: Final Result
After processing all indices, the final answer is the minimum value of `res[n - 1][0]` and `res[n - 1][1]`, which represents the minimum number of swaps required to achieve the desired sequence:
```cpp
return min(res[n - 1][0], res[n - 1][1]);
```

### Complexity
The time and space complexity of this solution is as follows:

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm iterates over the array of size `n` once and performs constant-time checks and updates for each index. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n).
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) due to the use of a DP table `res` to store the results.

### Conclusion
The solution effectively uses dynamic programming to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of swaps required to transform two arrays into strictly increasing sequences. By using a DP table, we keep track of the minimum number of swaps needed for each index, ensuring that we can make the optimal decision at each step. This solution is both time-efficient and space-efficient, making it well-suited for solving this problem within the given constraints. The time complexity is linear, O(n), and the space complexity is also O(n), making it scalable for larger input sizes.
