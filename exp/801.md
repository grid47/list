### Problem Statement
Given two arrays `n1` and `n2` of the same length, the goal is to find the minimum number of swaps required to make both arrays strictly increasing. A swap consists of exchanging the elements at the same index in both arrays.

### Approach
1. **Initialize a DP Table**:
   - Create a 2D vector `res` of size `n` (length of the arrays) where `res[i][0]` represents the minimum swaps needed to keep the sequences increasing without swapping the element at index `i`, and `res[i][1]` represents the minimum swaps needed when swapping the element at index `i`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - For the first element (index 0):
     - `res[0][0] = 0`: No swaps needed if we do not swap the first elements.
     - `res[0][1] = 1`: One swap needed if we swap the first elements.

3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - For each subsequent index `i` (from 1 to `n - 1`):
     - Determine if both sequences can continue increasing without swaps or if a swap is necessary:
       - **bothInc**: True if both sequences can continue increasing without swaps.
       - **crossInc**: True if a swap is needed to maintain the increasing order.
     - Based on the above checks, update the `res` array:
       - If both increasing and crossing increasing conditions are met, take the minimum of the previous states:
         - `res[i][0] = min(res[i - 1][0], res[i - 1][1])`
         - `res[i][1] = min(res[i - 1][0], res[i - 1][1]) + 1`
       - If only `bothInc` is true, no swap is needed for `res[i][0]` and a swap is needed for `res[i][1]`:
         - `res[i][0] = res[i - 1][0]`
         - `res[i][1] = res[i - 1][1] + 1`
       - If neither condition holds, maintain the previous swap counts accordingly.

4. **Final Result**:
   - Return the minimum of the last element's swap counts:
     - `return min(res[n - 1][0], res[n - 1][1]);`

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to calculate the minimum swaps.
    - `int minSwap(vector<int>& n1, vector<int>& n2)`: Implements the logic for calculating the minimum swaps.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `n1`: A vector of integers representing the first sequence.
        - `n2`: A vector of integers representing the second sequence.
      - **Returns**: An integer representing the minimum number of swaps needed to make both sequences strictly increasing.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input arrays. Each index is processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the additional storage used for the `res` array.
