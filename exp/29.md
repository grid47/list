### Problem Statement
Implement the division of two integers without using the multiplication, division, or mod operator. Return the quotient after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`. The result should be truncated towards zero.

### Approach
1. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - If the `dividend` is `INT_MIN` and `divisor` is `-1`, return `INT_MAX` to prevent overflow.

2. **Use Long Data Types**:
   - Convert both `dividend` and `divisor` to their absolute values using `labs()` to handle negative numbers effectively.
   - Store the sign of the result based on the signs of the `dividend` and `divisor`.

3. **Bit Manipulation for Division**:
   - Initialize a variable `ans` to store the quotient.
   - Use a loop to subtract the divisor from the dividend as long as it is possible.
   - Utilize bit shifting to speed up the process: repeatedly double the divisor (using left shift) and check against the dividend.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Multiply the result by the sign determined earlier to return the final quotient.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Edge Case Check**: The first conditional checks if the input will cause an overflow.
2. **Absolute Values**: `dvd` and `dvs` store the absolute values of the `dividend` and `divisor`, respectively.
3. **Sign Calculation**: `sgn` determines if the final result should be positive or negative.
4. **Division Loop**: The outer loop continues until the dividend is smaller than the divisor, and the inner loop finds the largest multiple of the divisor that fits into the current dividend.
5. **Final Result**: The final quotient is returned by multiplying `ans` by `sgn`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(\log N)\), where \(N\) is the absolute value of the dividend.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), since only a fixed amount of space is used for variables.
