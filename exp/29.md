### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to perform division of two integers without using the division operator (`/`). Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, the task is to return the quotient of the division. However, this solution must be done in a way that adheres to the constraints of not using the division, multiplication, or modulus operators directly.

The division must also handle edge cases, such as:
1. Overflow when dividing the minimum possible integer value (`INT_MIN`) by `-1`.
2. Positive and negative results depending on the signs of the dividend and divisor.

Additionally, the division must be performed with the correct handling of truncation towards zero, meaning if the result is a decimal, it should be rounded down.

### Approach

The approach to solving this problem efficiently without using direct division involves using **bit manipulation**. Specifically, it uses the technique of **repeated subtraction** but with an optimization using **bit shifts** to perform the operation much faster.

#### Steps:
1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - First, we handle the case where `dividend` is `INT_MIN` and `divisor` is `-1`. This case is special because dividing `INT_MIN` by `-1` results in an overflow (exceeding the maximum value that an integer can hold). In this case, we return `INT_MAX`.
  
2. **Convert to Positive Numbers:**
   - To simplify the problem, we work with the absolute values of `dividend` and `divisor`. This ensures we can focus on the magnitude of the numbers rather than their signs.
   - The sign of the final result will be determined later.

3. **Bitwise Division:**
   - The core of the algorithm uses **bit shifting** to find how many times the `divisor` can fit into the `dividend`. The idea is to shift the divisor to the left until it exceeds the dividend. The number of shifts represents how many times the divisor can fit into the dividend.
   - For each shift, we subtract the shifted divisor from the dividend and add the corresponding power of two to the result.

4. **Sign Handling:**
   - After calculating the magnitude of the result, we apply the correct sign by checking whether the `dividend` and `divisor` had different signs.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
if (dividend == INT_MIN && divisor == -1) return INT_MAX;
```
- This checks for overflow when dividing `INT_MIN` by `-1`, which would exceed the range of integers. The correct result in this case is `INT_MAX`.

```cpp
long dvd = labs(dividend), dvs = labs(divisor);
int sgn = (dividend > 0) ^ (divisor > 0) ? -1 : 1;
```
- Convert both `dividend` and `divisor` to their absolute values using `labs()`, which handles `long` integer absolute value calculation. This ensures we can work with positive numbers.
- The `sgn` variable calculates the sign of the result using the XOR operation. If the signs of `dividend` and `divisor` are different, `sgn` will be `-1` (negative result); otherwise, it will be `1` (positive result).

```cpp
long ans = 0;
```
- `ans` stores the result of the division as a long integer to avoid overflow.

```cpp
while (dvd >= dvs) {
    long tmp = dvs, m = 1;
    while (tmp << 1 <= dvd) {
        tmp <<= 1;
        m <<= 1;
    }
    dvd -= tmp;
    ans += m;
}
```
- The outer `while` loop keeps subtracting multiples of the `divisor` (doubled each time) from the `dividend` (`dvd`). The goal is to subtract the largest possible value of `divisor` at each step.
- `tmp <<= 1` doubles the `divisor` at each iteration, and `m <<= 1` keeps track of how many times this value was subtracted from `dvd`.
- Once we find the largest `tmp` that can fit into `dvd`, we subtract `tmp` from `dvd` and add `m` to the result (`ans`).
  
```cpp
return sgn * ans;
```
- Finally, we return the result `ans` multiplied by the sign (`sgn`), which accounts for the correct negative or positive result.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(log n)**: The time complexity is logarithmic due to the bit shifting. The divisor is doubled in each iteration, and the number of iterations is proportional to the logarithm of the `dividend` with respect to base 2. This leads to a time complexity of `O(log(n))`.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant because the algorithm only uses a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input. We use a few variables to store intermediate results, and no additional data structures are required.

### Conclusion

The solution for dividing two integers without using the division operator effectively uses **bit manipulation** to perform efficient **bitwise division**. By leveraging **bit shifts** and repeatedly subtracting large chunks of the divisor, the algorithm reduces the problem of division to a more efficient operation that runs in **O(log n)** time. This is much faster than a naive approach that would involve repeated subtraction.

The solution also handles important edge cases such as overflow when dividing `INT_MIN` by `-1`, and correctly calculates the sign of the result based on the signs of the dividend and divisor.

Overall, this approach provides an optimal solution with **O(1)** space complexity and logarithmic time complexity, making it suitable for large inputs where a direct division would be inefficient or not allowed.
