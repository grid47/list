### Problem Statement
Given an array of strings, determine the minimum number of columns that can be deleted to ensure that each row of the strings is lexicographically sorted.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `res`: Counter for the number of columns to delete.
   - `m`: Number of rows (strings).
   - `n`: Number of columns (characters in each string).
   - `sorted`: A boolean vector to track which rows are sorted based on previous columns.

2. **Iterate Over Columns**:
   - For each column `j`, check if it maintains the sorted order:
     - Iterate through the rows `i` to compare adjacent rows (`strs[i][j]` and `strs[i + 1][j]`).
     - If a row is found that violates the sorted order, increment `res` and break out of the inner loop.
   - If no violations are found for the column, update the `sorted` array to reflect whether the rows are sorted based on the current column.

3. **Return Result**:
   - The final value of `res` represents the minimum number of columns that need to be deleted.

### Code Walk-through
- The function first initializes necessary variables.
- It iterates through each column and checks if the column maintains the sorted order.
- If it finds a column that disrupts the order, it marks that column for deletion.
- Finally, it returns the count of deleted columns.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of strings and `n` is the length of each string. The function iterates through each column and each pair of rows.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m) for the `sorted` vector used to track sorted status.
