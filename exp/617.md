### Problem Statement
Given two binary trees, merge them into a new binary tree. The merging process involves summing the values of overlapping nodes. If two nodes overlap, their values are summed. If only one of the trees has a node at a given position, that node is used as the node in the merged tree.

### Approach
1. **Base Cases**: 
   - If both nodes are `NULL`, return `NULL`.
   - If one of the nodes is `NULL`, return the other node.
   - If both nodes are not `NULL`, create a new node with the sum of the values of both nodes.

2. **Recursion**:
   - Recursively merge the left children of both nodes.
   - Recursively merge the right children of both nodes.

### Code Walk-through
- The `mergeTrees` function takes two binary tree nodes (`r1` and `r2`).
- It creates a new node (`ans`) for the merged tree.
- Depending on the presence of `r1` and `r2`, it populates `ans->val`.
- It recursively merges the left and right subtrees.
- Finally, it returns the merged tree's root node.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the merged tree, as each node from both trees is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack.
