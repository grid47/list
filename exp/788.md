### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, count how many numbers between `1` and `n` are "good" numbers. A number is considered "good" if:
- Each digit in the number remains valid when rotated (i.e., 0, 1, 8 remain unchanged; 2, 5, 6, 9 become 5, 2, 9, 6, respectively; and 3, 4, 7 become invalid).
- At least one digit changes when the number is rotated.

### Approach
1. **Digit Mapping**:
   - Create an array `f` that maps each digit to its rotation result:
     - `0, 1, 8` remain unchanged (value `1`).
     - `2, 5, 6, 9` change to a valid digit (value `2`).
     - `3, 4, 7` are invalid (value `0`).

2. **Counting Good Numbers**:
   - Initialize a counter `res` to keep track of good numbers.
   - Loop through each number `i` from `1` to `n`.
     - For each number, initialize `p` to the current number and `s` to `1`.
     - For each digit in the number:
       - Multiply `s` by the corresponding value in `f` using the last digit of `p`.
       - Remove the last digit from `p` by performing integer division by `10`.
     - After processing all digits, if `s` is `2` or greater, increment `res` by `1` (indicating it is a good number).

3. **Result**:
   - Return the total count of good numbers found.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to count good rotated numbers.
    - `int rotatedDigits(int n)`: Main function to compute the count of good numbers.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `n`: The upper limit of the range to count good numbers.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(d * n), where \( d \) is the number of digits in each number. This results from iterating through all numbers up to `n` and checking each digit of the number.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a fixed-size array `f` and a few integer variables.
