### Problem Statement

The task is to determine how many **good integers** exist from `1` to `n`. A **good integer** is defined as an integer that, when rotated 180 degrees, still forms a valid integer. For example, the integer `69` becomes `96` when rotated, and both of these are valid integers. However, integers like `3`, `4`, `7`, and others that don't form valid digits after rotation are considered invalid. We are asked to count how many such valid, rotatable integers exist between `1` and `n` (inclusive).

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to check each integer from `1` to `n` to see if it can be rotated and still result in a valid integer. The basic idea is to examine each digit of a number, and ensure that when rotated, each digit transforms into another valid digit. Some digits remain unchanged when rotated (such as `0`, `1`, and `8`), while others change into different digits (for example, `6` becomes `9` and vice versa).

The key observation is that the following digits are **valid** when rotated 180 degrees:
- `0`, `1`, `8` stay the same.
- `6` becomes `9`.
- `9` becomes `6`.

On the other hand, the digits `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `7` are **invalid**, meaning if any of these digits appear in a number, it will be an invalid integer after rotation.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's break down the code and understand how it works to solve the problem:

1. **Initialization**:
   - First, we define an array `f` of size 10, where each index represents a digit from `0` to `9`. The value at each index indicates how the digit behaves when rotated:
     - `0`, `1`, and `8` remain unchanged (`f[0] = 1`, `f[1] = 1`, `f[8] = 1`).
     - `6` becomes `9` (`f[6] = 2`).
     - `9` becomes `6` (`f[9] = 2`).
     - `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `7` are invalid and marked as `0` in the array (`f[2] = 0`, `f[3] = 0`, etc.).
   
   ```cpp
   int f[] = {1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2};
   int res = 0;
   ```

2. **Iterate Over All Numbers from 1 to n**:
   - We then loop through all integers `i` from `1` to `n` (inclusive).
   - For each integer `i`, we initialize a variable `p` to the current number and a variable `s` to 1. This variable `s` will keep track of the status of the number â€” whether it's a valid or invalid number when rotated.

   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
       int p = i;
       int s = 1;
   ```

3. **Check the Digits of the Current Number**:
   - Inside the loop, we check each digit of the number `i` to see if it is valid after rotation. We do this by repeatedly extracting the last digit of the number (`p % 10`) and checking its value using the array `f`. If any digit is invalid (`f[digit] == 0`), we set `s` to `0`, indicating that the number cannot be rotated to form a valid integer.
   - We multiply `s` by `f[p % 10]`, so if any digit is invalid, `s` becomes `0` and the number is considered invalid.
   
   ```cpp
   while(p) {
       s *= f[p % 10];
       p /= 10;
   }
   ```

4. **Update the Result**:
   - After checking all the digits of the number, if `s` is greater than or equal to 2, it means the number is a "good" integer (it forms a valid integer after rotation), and we increment the result `res` by 1.
   
   ```cpp
   if (s >= 2) res += 1;
   ```

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns the result `res`, which contains the count of good integers between `1` and `n`.

   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The time complexity of this solution is **O(n * m)**, where `n` is the input number and `m` is the average number of digits in the integers from `1` to `n`.
  - For each number `i`, we extract each digit and check if it is a valid digit after rotation. In the worst case, this takes `O(m)` time, where `m` is the number of digits in `i` (which is logarithmic with respect to `n`).
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n * log n)**, where `log n` represents the number of digits in the largest number `n`.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is **O(1)** since we only use a fixed amount of extra space (the array `f` and a few integer variables), regardless of the size of the input `n`.

### Conclusion

This solution provides an efficient way to count the number of **good integers** from `1` to `n`. By examining each integer digit by digit and ensuring that all digits are valid when rotated, the solution can quickly identify valid integers and count them. The use of a simple lookup array `f` to determine how each digit behaves when rotated allows the solution to efficiently process each number.

The algorithm is optimized for performance, achieving a time complexity of **O(n * log n)**, which is suitable for large inputs, and the space complexity is constant, **O(1)**. This makes the solution both time and space-efficient.

In summary, this approach leverages digit manipulation and rotation validation using a simple lookup table to efficiently solve the problem of counting good integers. The solution works well for a wide range of input sizes and ensures that we can easily determine the count of valid numbers without performing unnecessary operations.
