### Problem Statement
Given a list of non-negative integers and a target value, find the number of ways to assign symbols to the integers such that they sum up to the target. Each integer can be assigned either a '+' or '-' sign.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**:
   - Utilize a recursive function with memoization to store the results of subproblems defined by the current target and index.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Base Case: If the index reaches the end of the list (`idx == nums.size()`), check if the current target equals zero. If yes, return 1 (indicating one valid way).
   - Memoization Check: Before calculating, check if the result for the current `(target, idx)` is already computed. If yes, return that result.
   - Recursive Cases:
     - Calculate the number of ways by subtracting the current number from the target.
     - Calculate the number of ways by adding the current number to the target.
   - Store the computed result in the memoization map.

3. **Initial Call**:
   - The `findTargetSumWays()` function initializes the process by calling the `dp()` function with the initial target and index.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `findTargetSumWays()` function initializes necessary variables and calls the `dp()` function.

2. **DP Function**:
   - The `dp(int target, int idx)` function computes the number of ways to reach the given target starting from the index `idx`.

3. **Return Result**:
   - The final result is the total number of ways to reach the target sum.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * T), where n is the number of elements in `nums` and T is the range of the target sum, due to the memoized DP solution.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * T) for the memoization map storing results for each `(target, idx)` pair.
