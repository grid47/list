### Problem Statement
Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, determine if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1` as a substring. The characters in `s1` can be rearranged in any order, and you need to check if such an arrangement exists in `s2`.

### Approach
1. **Character Count**:
   - Use two frequency vectors of size 26 (for each letter of the alphabet) to keep track of the character counts in `s1` and the current window of `s2`.

2. **Initial Count**:
   - Iterate through `s1` to populate its frequency vector (`p1`).

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - Traverse `s2` using a sliding window approach:
     - Incrementally build the frequency vector for the current window in `s2` (`p2`).
     - If the window size exceeds that of `s1`, decrement the count of the character that falls out of the window.
     - After updating `p2`, check if it matches `p1`.

4. **Check for Match**:
   - If at any point the frequency vectors match, it means a permutation of `s1` is found in `s2`, and the function returns `true`.

### Code Walk-through
- The function `checkInclusion` initializes two vectors `p1` and `p2`.
- It fills `p1` with the counts of characters in `s1`.
- It then iterates through `s2`, updating `p2` and checking for matches with `p1`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of `s2`. Each character in `s2` is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the space used for `p1` and `p2` is constant (26 elements).
