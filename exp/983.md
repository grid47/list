### Problem Statement
You are given:
1. An array `days`, where each element represents a day on which you need to travel.
2. An array `cost` where `cost[0]`, `cost[1]`, and `cost[2]` represent the prices for 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day tickets, respectively.

The goal is to find the minimum cost needed to cover all travel days in `days`.

### Approach
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
  - Let `dp[i]` represent the minimum cost required to travel up to day `i`.
  - Maintain a boolean vector `td` to mark days on which travel is required.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The last day to consider is `d = days.back()`.
   - Create a DP array `dp` of size `d + 1` initialized to zero, and a boolean array `td` of the same size, where `td[i]` is `true` if `i` is a travel day.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - For each day `i` from `1` to `d`:
     - If `td[i]` is `false`, set `dp[i] = dp[i - 1]` (no extra cost on non-travel days).
     - If `td[i]` is `true`, calculate the minimum cost:
       - Either buy a 1-day ticket (`cost[0] + dp[i - 1]`),
       - Or a 7-day ticket (`cost[1] + dp[max(i - 7, 0)]`),
       - Or a 30-day ticket (`cost[2] + dp[max(i - 30, 0)]`).

3. **Result**: The minimum cost to cover all required travel days is stored in `dp[d]`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(D), where D is the maximum day in `days`, as each day up to `D` is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(D), as we use two arrays of size `D + 1`.
