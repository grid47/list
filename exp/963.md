### Problem Statement
Given a set of points in a 2D plane, find the area of the smallest rectangle that can be formed such that all four corners of the rectangle are taken from the provided points. The rectangle must be axis-aligned and must contain no points inside it.

### Approach
1. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Define a function `d2` that calculates the squared Euclidean distance between two points. This avoids floating-point inaccuracies and unnecessary square root calculations.

2. **Mapping Points**:
   - Use a nested loop to iterate over all pairs of points. For each pair, calculate:
     - The center of the potential rectangle formed by these two points.
     - The squared length of the line segment between the two points.
   - Store these pairs in a hash map (`m`) where the key is a combination of the center coordinates and the squared length.

3. **Identifying Rectangles**:
   - Iterate through the hash map to find pairs of segments that share the same center and length.
   - For each combination of segments, compute the area of the rectangle formed by the endpoints of these segments.

4. **Calculate Minimum Area**:
   - Track the minimum area found during the iterations.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the square root of the minimum area to get the actual area.

### Code Walk-through
1. **`d2` Function**:
   - Computes the squared distance between two points to be used in area calculations.

2. **`minAreaFreeRect` Method**:
   - Initializes a hash map to store potential rectangles.
   - Loops through all pairs of points to populate the hash map with centers and lengths.
   - Checks each possible rectangle formed by the endpoints to compute and compare areas.

3. **Area Calculation**:
   - For valid rectangles, computes the area using the squared distance and updates the minimum area variable.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2), where N is the number of points. The algorithm involves nested loops to compare each pair of points.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing points and their associated centers and lengths in the hash map.
