### Problem Statement
Given a list of strings `words`, return the longest string that can be built one character at a time by appending letters. If there are multiple longest strings, return the lexicographically smallest one.

### Approach
1. **Sorting**:
   - First, sort the list of words. This ensures that we can easily find the lexicographically smallest longest word.

2. **Using a Set**:
   - Utilize an unordered set to keep track of the words that can be formed by appending letters.

3. **Iterate Through Words**:
   - For each word `w` in the sorted list:
     - Check if the word is of length 1 (which can always be built) or if the substring formed by removing the last character (`w.substr(0, w.size() - 1)`) is already in the set.
     - If either condition is met, it means the current word can be built.
     - Compare its size to the currently recorded longest word. If it's longer, update the result.
     - Insert the current word into the set.

4. **Result**:
   - After processing all words, the result will contain the longest word that can be built.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function**:
  - `longestWord(vector<string>& words)`: Finds the longest word that can be formed from the given list of words.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of words due to sorting.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the storage of the set to track formed words.
