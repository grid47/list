### Problem Statement

In this problem, we are given a list of numbers in the form of strings (`nums`), and several queries (`q`). Each query consists of two integers:
1. The **k-th smallest** trimmed number's index in the result after trimming the last `k` digits of the numbers.
2. A **trim length** `k` that determines how many digits from the end of the string should be retained.

The goal is to determine the index of the `k`-th smallest number from the list after trimming each number according to the query and sorting the trimmed numbers lexicographically.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, the approach involves the following key steps:
1. **Trimming the Numbers**: For each query, we need to trim each number by keeping only the last `k` digits.
2. **Sorting the Trimmed Numbers**: Once we have trimmed the numbers, we sort them lexicographically.
3. **Selecting the k-th Smallest**: After sorting, we select the index of the `k`-th smallest trimmed number.
4. **Returning the Result**: The answer for each query is the index of the `k`-th smallest trimmed number.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. **Defining the Result Vector**
```cpp
vector<int> res;
```
- The `res` vector is used to store the results for each query. For each query, we will store the index of the `k`-th smallest trimmed number.

#### 2. **Iterating Through Queries**
```cpp
for(auto &v : q) {
```
- The `for` loop iterates over each query `v` in the list `q`.
- Each query `v` is a vector of two integers: `v[0]` (the `k`-th smallest number to find) and `v[1]` (the number of digits to trim).

#### 3. **Preparing the Trimmed Numbers**
```cpp
vector<pair<string, int>> fk;
for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
    fk.push_back({nums[i].substr(nums[i].size() - v[1]), i});
}
```
- **`vector<pair<string, int>> fk;`**: A vector `fk` of pairs is created to store each number's trimmed version along with its original index.
- **`nums[i].substr(nums[i].size() - v[1])`**: For each number `nums[i]`, the `substr` function is used to extract the last `v[1]` digits. This gives us the "trimmed" version of the number.
- **`i`**: We store the index `i` of the number along with the trimmed string to preserve the original index after sorting.

#### 4. **Sorting the Trimmed Numbers**
```cpp
sort(fk.begin(), fk.end());
```
- The vector `fk` is sorted in lexicographical order based on the trimmed numbers (the first part of each pair). The sorting is done in ascending order, so the smallest trimmed numbers come first.

#### 5. **Selecting the k-th Smallest Trimmed Number**
```cpp
res.push_back(fk[v[0] - 1].second);
```
- After sorting, the `v[0] - 1`-th element (i.e., the `k`-th smallest trimmed number) is selected from the sorted vector `fk`. We then push the index (`second` part of the pair) of this trimmed number into the `res` vector.

#### 6. **Returning the Result**
```cpp
return res;
```
- Once all queries have been processed, the `res` vector containing the indices of the k-th smallest trimmed numbers for each query is returned.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Sorting Step**: For each query, we are sorting the list of `nums` based on their trimmed versions. Sorting `n` elements takes **O(n log n)** time, where `n` is the size of the `nums` array.
- **Trimming Step**: For each number, we are performing the `substr` operation, which takes **O(m)** time where `m` is the length of each number (assuming all numbers have the same length).
- Therefore, for each query, the total time complexity is **O(n log n + n * m)**, where:
  - `n` is the number of numbers in `nums`.
  - `m` is the maximum length of the numbers in `nums`.

Since the query count `q` is processed independently, the overall time complexity for all queries is:
- **O(q * (n log n + n * m))**.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The space complexity is **O(n)** because we store the `n` trimmed numbers along with their indices in the vector `fk` for each query.

### Conclusion

The algorithm efficiently handles each query by trimming the numbers, sorting them, and selecting the k-th smallest value. By using a combination of vector and map data structures, we ensure that the solution is both time and space efficient, even for large inputs. With a time complexity of **O(q * (n log n + n * m))**, the approach handles multiple queries efficiently, making it suitable for a variety of problem sizes. The solution is robust and correctly handles edge cases, returning the correct index of the k-th smallest trimmed number for each query.
