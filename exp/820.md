### Problem Statement
Given a list of words, we need to find the minimum length of a string that can encode all the words by appending a `#` character after each word. Each word should be represented only once and should not overlap with the others.

### Approach
1. **Use a Set for Unique Words**:
   - Store all words in an unordered set to ensure uniqueness and allow for efficient lookup.

2. **Remove Substrings**:
   - For each word, iterate through its possible suffixes (from the second character to the end of the word) and remove these suffixes from the set. This is done because if a suffix of a word exists in the set, the full word does not need to be counted as it can be represented by its suffix.

3. **Calculate Length**:
   - After processing all words, the remaining words in the set represent the unique roots. The total length required to encode these words is calculated by summing the lengths of the words plus one for the `#` character for each.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the total calculated length.

### Code Walk-through
- The `minimumLengthEncoding` function initializes a set with the input words.
- It then removes all substrings (suffixes) from the set.
- Finally, it sums the lengths of the remaining words, adding one for each, to compute the total length.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * L), where N is the number of words and L is the average length of the words. This is due to iterating over each word and its suffixes.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), as we store the unique words in a set.

This method efficiently computes the minimum length required for encoding the words by leveraging the properties of substrings.
