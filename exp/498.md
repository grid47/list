### Problem Statement
Given a matrix of integers, traverse the matrix in a diagonal order starting from the top-left corner. The traversal direction alternates between moving upwards and downwards across diagonals.

### Approach
1. **Determine Dimensions**:
   - Get the number of rows (`m`) and columns (`n`) of the matrix.

2. **Diagonal Traversal**:
   - Iterate through each diagonal defined by the sum of indices (`s`), which ranges from `0` to `m + n - 2`.
   - For each diagonal, compute possible index pairs `(i, j)` that fall on that diagonal.
   - Depending on whether the diagonal index `s` is even or odd, decide the traversal direction (upwards or downwards).

3. **Index Validation**:
   - Check if the calculated indices are within the bounds of the matrix before accessing elements to avoid out-of-bounds errors.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Class Definition**:
   - The `Solution` class contains the method `findDiagonalOrder`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The method initializes an empty vector `res` to store the traversal result.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates through each diagonal sum.
   - The inner loop calculates the valid indices `(i, j)` for each diagonal and adds the corresponding elements to `res` based on the calculated indices.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - Finally, the function returns the result vector `res`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns, since each element is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the traversal result storage (excluding the output), as no additional data structures proportional to the input size are used.
