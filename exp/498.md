### Problem Statement

The problem is to traverse a 2D matrix in a diagonal order and return the elements in a 1D array. Diagonal order starts at the top-left corner of the matrix and proceeds along diagonals. For even-numbered diagonals (starting from zero), elements are traversed from top to bottom, while for odd-numbered diagonals, elements are traversed from bottom to top. The task is to implement an efficient solution that handles matrices of varying dimensions.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we use a combination of nested loops to iterate over diagonals, while adjusting the direction of traversal for each diagonal. The approach involves calculating the sum of indices for each diagonal, which simplifies the process of accessing elements along a diagonal.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the approach:

1. **Sum of Indices to Identify Diagonals**:
   - The key insight is that elements on the same diagonal share the same sum of indices `i + j`.
   - For a matrix with `m` rows and `n` columns, the range of possible `i + j` values is from `0` to `m + n - 2`.

2. **Nested Loop Traversal**:
   - For each diagonal represented by `s = i + j`, we iterate through possible values of `i` from `0` to `s`, calculating `j` as `s - i`.
   - We ensure that only valid `(i, j)` pairs are accessed within the bounds of the matrix. If `i` or `j` exceed matrix dimensions, we skip to the next element.

3. **Swapping Indices for Alternating Direction**:
   - For even diagonals (`s % 2 == 0`), we swap `i` and `j` to traverse from top to bottom.
   - For odd diagonals, we retain the `i` and `j` values as they are to maintain the bottom-to-top traversal.

4. **Building the Result Array**:
   - For each valid `(i, j)` pair, the corresponding element `mat[i][j]` is appended to the result array.
   - After iterating through all possible diagonals, we return the result array containing the elements in diagonal order.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the code:

1. **Function Signature**:
   ```cpp
   vector<int> findDiagonalOrder(vector<vector<int>>& mat);
   ```
   - This function accepts a matrix `mat` of dimensions `m x n` and returns a vector of integers representing the elements in diagonal order.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int m = mat.size(), n = mat[0].size();
   vector<int> res;
   ```
   - `m` and `n` store the dimensions of the matrix.
   - `res` is an empty vector to store the result.

3. **Looping Over Diagonals**:
   ```cpp
   for (int s = 0; s <= m + n - 2; s++) {
       for (int x = 0; x <= s; x++) {
           int i = x;
           int j = s - i;
           if (s % 2 == 0) swap(i, j);
           if (i >= m || j >= n) continue;
           res.push_back(mat[i][j]);
       }
   }
   ```
   - **Outer Loop (Diagonals)**: For each possible diagonal sum `s`, we loop through potential values of `i` and calculate `j` as `s - i`.
   - **Even Diagonal Adjustment**: When `s` is even, we swap `i` and `j` to ensure elements are traversed in the desired top-to-bottom order.
   - **Bounds Check**: If `i` or `j` exceed matrix dimensions (`i >= m` or `j >= n`), we skip to the next iteration to avoid out-of-bounds access.
   - **Add Element to Result**: For valid `(i, j)` pairs, `mat[i][j]` is added to `res`.

4. **Return Statement**:
   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```
   - After completing all diagonal traversals, we return `res` as the result.

### Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is `O(m * n)` since we process each element of the matrix once.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is `O(m * n)`, where `m * n` is the size of the matrix, as we store each element in the result vector `res`.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently handles diagonal traversal of a matrix by leveraging the properties of diagonal sums and alternating traversal directions. The approach is both concise and scalable, making it well-suited for matrices of different sizes. By adjusting traversal direction based on the sum of indices, the solution ensures that each element is accessed in the correct order, resulting in a clear and efficient solution to the diagonal traversal problem. This method also avoids extra space for auxiliary data structures, keeping the code both elegant and performant.
