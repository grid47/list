### Problem Statement
Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. The nodes should be rearranged in the same relative order as they were in the input list. 

### Approach
The approach involves maintaining two separate pointers for odd and even indexed nodes in the list. The odd indexed nodes will be linked together followed by the even indexed nodes.

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use two pointers: `odd` for the current odd node, initialized to the head, and `even` for the current even node, initialized to `head->next`. The `ehead` pointer is used to remember the start of the even list.

2. **Rearranging the List**:
   - Traverse the linked list using a while loop until you reach the end of the even nodes. In each iteration:
     - Connect the `odd` pointer to the next odd node.
     - Connect the `even` pointer to the next even node.
     - Move the `odd` and `even` pointers forward.

3. **Final Connection**:
   - After the loop, connect the end of the odd list to the head of the even list (using the `ehead` pointer).

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A pointer to the head of a singly linked list.
- **Output**: A pointer to the head of the modified list with odd indexed nodes followed by even indexed nodes.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the list, as we traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space for the pointers.
