### Problem Statement
Given a rotated sorted array `nums` (with no duplicates), find the minimum element in the array.

### Approach
1. **Binary Search**:
   - Use a binary search approach to efficiently find the minimum element. The idea is to utilize the properties of a rotated sorted array.

2. **Initialize Pointers**:
   - Start with two pointers, `s` (start) initialized to 0 and `e` (end) initialized to the last index of the array.

3. **Iterate Until Pointers Meet**:
   - While `s` is less than `e`, perform the following:
     - Calculate `mid` as the average of `s` and `e`.
     - If the element at `mid` is greater than the element at `e`, it means the minimum is in the right half, so move the `s` pointer to `mid + 1`.
     - Otherwise, the minimum must be in the left half, including `mid`, so move the `e` pointer to `mid`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - When `s` equals `e`, return `nums[s]`, which will be the minimum element in the rotated array.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the `findMin` function, accepting a vector of integers as input.
- **Line 2**: Initialize variables for size `n`, starting index `s`, ending index `e`, and a placeholder `ans`.
- **Line 4**: Check if the array has only one element and return it.
- **Line 6-16**: Implement the binary search:
  - **Line 8**: Calculate `mid`.
  - **Line 11-14**: Check if `nums[mid]` is greater than `nums[e]` to decide which half to search in next.
- **Line 17**: Return the minimum element found at `nums[e]`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in `nums`, due to the binary search method.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) as only a fixed amount of extra space is used.
