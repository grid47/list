### 🌐 Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

In this task, we’re given a rotated sorted array, and our goal is to identify the **minimum element** efficiently. This array was originally sorted in ascending order but was then rotated at an unknown pivot point. 

For instance:
- Original array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
- After rotating by 3 positions: `[4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3]`

In this case, `1` is the smallest element, and we want to locate it using an optimized approach with **O(log n)** time complexity. Let’s dive into the steps to solve this problem efficiently!

### 💡 Approach

Our approach leverages **binary search** principles but with a twist to account for the rotation:

1. **Rotation Insight**: The minimum element is where the array “rotates” or changes direction. We compare the middle element (`nums[mid]`) with the last element (`nums[e]`) to determine which half contains the minimum.
2. **Binary Search Adjustments**:
   - If `nums[mid]` is greater than `nums[e]`, the minimum element is in the **right half** of the array.
   - If `nums[mid]` is less than or equal to `nums[e]`, the minimum is in the **left half** or could be `mid` itself.

### 📝 Code Breakdown (Step-by-Step)

#### 🔹 Step 1: Initialize Variables

```cpp
int n = nums.size();
int s = 0, e = n - 1;

if(n == 1) return nums[0];
```

Explanation:
- `n`: Size of the input array `nums`.
- `s` and `e`: Represent the start and end indices, respectively.
- If there’s only one element (`n == 1`), it’s trivially the minimum.

#### 🔹 Step 2: Binary Search Loop

```cpp
while(s < e) {
    int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;
```

This `while` loop will continue as long as `s` is less than `e`. It calculates `mid` using `s + (e - s) / 2` to prevent overflow.

#### 🔹 Step 3: Adjust Search Range Based on Element Comparison

```cpp
if(nums[e] < nums[mid]) {
    s = mid + 1;
} else {
    e = mid;
}
```

Key steps:
- If `nums[e] < nums[mid]`, the minimum must be in the right half, so we update `s` to `mid + 1`.
- Otherwise, the minimum is in the left half, so we update `e` to `mid`.

#### 🔹 Step 4: Return the Minimum Element

```cpp
return nums[e];
```

At the end, `s` and `e` converge at the minimum element’s index, so we return `nums[e]`.

### 🔎 Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: **O(log n)** due to the binary search approach.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** since we only use a few extra variables.

### ✅ Conclusion

This modified binary search provides an optimal solution to locate the minimum element in **O(log n)** time, even when the array is rotated. This method is efficient for large arrays and showcases how binary search can be adapted to solve rotated array problems.
