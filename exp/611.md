### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums`, determine the number of valid triangles that can be formed using the elements of the array. A triangle is valid if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.

### Approach
1. **Sorting the Array**: 
   - Start by sorting the array in non-decreasing order. This makes it easier to apply the triangle inequality since for any three sides `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `a ≤ b ≤ c`), we only need to check if `a + b > c`.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Use a loop to fix the largest side (`nums[i]`).
   - Use two pointers: one starting at the beginning of the array (`j`) and the other just before the fixed largest side (`k`).
   - Check if the sum of the two pointers' values (`nums[j] + nums[k]`) is greater than the largest side (`nums[i]`):
     - If it is, then all values between `j` and `k` can form a valid triangle with `nums[i]`. Thus, add `k - j` to the count and decrement `k`.
     - If it is not, increment `j` to try a larger value.

3. **Count Valid Triangles**:
   - Keep a counter (`cnt`) that tracks the number of valid triangles found.

### Code Walk-through
- The `triangleNumber` function takes a vector of integers (`nums`).
- It sorts `nums` to facilitate the triangle inequality check.
- For each potential largest side, it uses a nested loop with two pointers to count all valid triangles that can be formed with the remaining sides.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2), where N is the number of elements in `nums`. This arises from the outer loop iterating over the largest side and the inner while loop working with the two pointers.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space proportional to the input size is used.
