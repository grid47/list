### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, generate a magical string that starts with "122" and follows specific rules to generate further characters. Return the number of '1's in the first `n` characters of this string.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with the magical string initialized to "122".

2. **Generating the String**:
   - Use a loop to generate characters based on the current value at the index pointed to by `i`.
   - The character to append is determined by `s.back() ^ 3`, which alternates between '1' and '2'.

3. **Counting '1's**:
   - After generating enough characters (at least `n`), count how many '1's are present in the first `n` characters of the string.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `magicalString()` takes an integer `n` as input.

2. **String Generation**:
   - Initialize the magical string with "122".
   - Loop until the string reaches or exceeds the required length `n`, appending new characters based on the rules.

3. **Count '1's**:
   - Use the `count` function to tally the number of '1's in the substring from the beginning of the string to `n`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for generating the string and counting '1's, where `n` is the input size.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the string up to `n` characters.
