### Problem Statement
The objective is to transpose a given matrix \( A \). Transposing a matrix involves flipping it over its diagonal, which means converting the row indices of the original matrix into column indices in the new matrix.

### Approach
1. **Matrix Dimensions**:
   - Determine the number of rows \( M \) and columns \( N \) in the input matrix \( A \).

2. **Create Transposed Matrix**:
   - Initialize a new matrix \( B \) with dimensions \( N \times M \) filled with zeros. This will hold the transposed values.

3. **Populate Transposed Matrix**:
   - Use two nested loops to iterate through each element of matrix \( A \):
     - The outer loop iterates over columns \( j \) (from 0 to \( N-1 \)).
     - The inner loop iterates over rows \( i \) (from 0 to \( M-1 \)).
     - Assign \( B[j][i] \) to \( A[i][j] \), effectively swapping rows and columns.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the transposed matrix \( B \).

### Code Walk-through
- The `transpose` function initializes the new matrix and fills it using nested loops based on the dimensions of the original matrix.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(M * N), where \( M \) is the number of rows and \( N \) is the number of columns in the input matrix. Each element is accessed and assigned once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N * M) for the new transposed matrix.
