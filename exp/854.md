### Problem Statement

In this problem, we are given two strings, `s1` and `s2`, which are anagrams of each other. The goal is to find the **minimum number of adjacent swaps** required to convert `s1` into `s2`. 

### Approach

The approach to solve this problem is inspired by the concept of **breadth-first search (BFS)**, as we are looking for the minimum number of transformations (or swaps) to convert one string into another. Since we are dealing with strings, each string state can be considered as a node, and the transition from one string to another is made by swapping two characters in the string. BFS is ideal for this kind of problem because it explores all possible states level by level, guaranteeing that the first time we reach the target string, we will have found the shortest sequence of swaps.

We can think of each string state as a node, and each valid swap as an edge between two nodes. The BFS will explore all possible valid swaps and return the shortest number of swaps needed to convert `s1` into `s2`.

### Plan:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Use a queue to perform BFS starting from `s1`.
   - Keep track of visited states in an unordered set `seen` to avoid processing the same state multiple times.
   - The `level` variable will represent the number of swaps or transformations required to reach the target state `s2`.

2. **Next State Generation**:
   - For each state (string), we generate all possible states that can be reached by a single adjacent swap. This will be done using a helper function `next(a, b)` that generates all strings by swapping two characters of string `a` to make it closer to string `b`.

3. **BFS Execution**:
   - While the queue is not empty, we process each string and check if it matches `s2`. If it does, return the current level (number of swaps).
   - For each string, generate all possible valid next states by calling the `next(a, b)` function and push them into the queue if they have not been visited yet.

4. **Edge Case**: If `s1` is already equal to `s2`, the minimum number of swaps is zero, and we return immediately.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: BFS Initialization

```cpp
queue<string> q;
q.push(s1);
int level = 0;
unordered_set<string> seen;
seen.insert(s1);
```

- We start by pushing the initial string `s1` into a queue for BFS. 
- `level` will track how many swaps (or transformations) it takes to reach `s2`. 
- An unordered set `seen` is used to avoid revisiting states that have already been processed.

#### Step 2: BFS Processing Loop

```cpp
while(!q.empty()) {
    int sz = q.size();
    for(int i = 0; i < sz; i++) {

        string node = q.front(); q.pop();

        if(node == s2) return level;
```

- We process the queue level by level. Each level represents one step or swap.
- If the current state (node) matches the target string `s2`, we return the `level`, which indicates the minimum number of swaps required.

#### Step 3: Generating Next States

```cpp
for(auto nbr : next(node, s2))
    if(seen.find(nbr) == seen.end()) {
        seen.insert(nbr);
        q.push(nbr);
    }
```

- For each string (node), we generate all the valid adjacent swaps that bring us closer to `s2`. This is done by the `next` function.
- For each valid next state (`nbr`), if it hasn't been visited yet (not in `seen`), we mark it as visited and add it to the queue for further exploration.

#### Step 4: Incrementing the Level

```cpp
level++;
```

- After processing all strings at the current level (all the possible states that can be reached with one more swap), we increment the `level` variable to track the number of transformations/swaps taken.

#### Step 5: Helper Function for Generating Next States

```cpp
unordered_set<string> next(string a, string b) {
    int i = 0;
    for(; i < a.size(); i++)
        if(a[i] != b[i]) break;

    unordered_set<string> res;
    for(int j = i + 1; j < a.size(); j++)
        if(a[j] == b[i]) {
            swap(a[i], a[j]);
            res.insert(a);
            swap(a[i], a[j]);
        }
    return res;
}
```

- The `next(a, b)` function generates all the possible valid states that can be reached by making a single adjacent swap in `a` to make it closer to `b`.
- We iterate through `a` and find the first mismatch with `b`. Then, we try all characters after the mismatch and swap them one by one to generate the new states.
- If the swap leads to a valid state, we add it to the result set `res`.
- Finally, we return the set of all valid next states.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **BFS Processing**: Each time we process a string, we generate its next states, which is proportional to the length of the string, `n`. In the worst case, we need to process all possible states (strings), which would be at most `n!` (factorial of `n`).
- **Next State Generation**: The time to generate all the next states for a string is proportional to `n` because we check each character for potential swaps.

Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n * n!)**, which arises due to generating all permutations of `s1` and examining them through BFS.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Queue and Set**: We store each string in the queue and set, so the space complexity is **O(n!)** in the worst case due to storing all possible strings.

### Conclusion

The algorithm successfully uses breadth-first search (BFS) to find the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to transform one string into another. By leveraging BFS, we guarantee that the first time we encounter the target string `s2`, we will have found the shortest path to it. 

This approach is optimal for this problem, considering we must explore all possible adjacent swaps systematically. Although the factorial time complexity may seem daunting, it is necessary due to the nature of the problem, which requires exploring a large number of possible permutations of the string. The use of a queue and a set to avoid revisiting states ensures that we do not perform redundant work. 

This algorithm efficiently solves the problem of finding the minimum number of adjacent swaps for string transformation, providing a clear, understandable solution for string manipulation problems involving BFS.
