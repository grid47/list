### Problem Statement
You are tasked with implementing a printer that can only print one character at a time. When printing a character, if the same character is already printed before, it doesn't count towards the print count. Your goal is to determine the minimum number of times the printer needs to be used to print a given string `s`.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Table**:
   - Use a 2D DP array `memo` to store results for subproblems. `memo[l][r]` represents the minimum number of prints needed to print the substring `s[l...r]`.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Define a recursive function `dp(l, r)` that computes the minimum prints required for the substring from index `l` to `r`.
   - If `l > r`, return 0 since there are no characters to print.
   - If the result for `memo[l][r]` is already computed, return that value.

3. **Base Case**:
   - The base case considers printing a single character, which requires one print. This is handled by initializing `ans` to `1 + dp(l + 1, r)`.

4. **Check for Matching Characters**:
   - Iterate through the substring from `l + 1` to `r`:
     - If `s[i]` matches `s[l]`, update `ans` to be the minimum of the current value and the sum of prints required for the segments `dp(l + 1, i)` and `dp(i + 1, r)`. This means we can print `s[l]` first and then print the characters between `l` and `i`, followed by printing from `i + 1` to `r`.

5. **Store and Return Result**:
   - Store the computed value in `memo[l][r]` and return it.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: The DP table is initialized to `-1` to signify uncomputed values.
2. **Recursive Calls**: The function is called with the entire range of the string to compute the minimum prints needed.
3. **Memoization**: Results are stored in the `memo` table to avoid recomputation and speed up the process.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^3), where `n` is the length of the string. The recursive function explores all pairs of indices and checks for matching characters, leading to a cubic time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2), for the memoization table that stores results for all pairs of indices.
