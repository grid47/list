### Problem Statement
Given an `n x n` grid representing the heights of buildings, the goal is to determine the maximum total increase in height for these buildings, such that the new heights do not exceed the skyline formed by the maximum heights in each row and column.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Structures**:
   - Create vectors `row` and `col` of size `n` to store the maximum heights for each row and column respectively.

2. **Calculate Maximum Heights**:
   - Loop through each cell in the grid:
     - For each building at position `(i, j)`, update `row[i]` and `col[j]` to store the maximum height found in that row and column.

3. **Calculate Maximum Increase**:
   - Initialize a variable `res` to accumulate the total height increase.
   - Loop through each cell again and calculate the possible increase in height for each building:
     - The maximum new height for the building at `(i, j)` is determined by the minimum of `row[i]` and `col[j]`.
     - Add the difference between this maximum height and the current height `grid[i][j]` to `res`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - Return the total increase stored in `res`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to compute the maximum height increase while keeping the skyline.
    - `int maxIncreaseKeepingSkyline(vector<vector<int>>& grid)`: Implements the logic for calculating the maximum increase.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `grid`: A vector of vectors representing the heights of the buildings.
      - **Returns**: An integer representing the maximum total increase in height.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the dimension of the grid. Each cell is visited multiple times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the auxiliary vectors `row` and `col`.
