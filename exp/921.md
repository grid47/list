### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` consisting of parentheses `(` and `)`, determine the minimum number of parentheses that must be added to make the string valid. A string is considered valid if:
- Every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis.
- The closing parenthesis must occur after its corresponding opening parenthesis.

### Approach
1. **Using a Stack**:
   - Utilize a stack to keep track of unmatched opening parentheses.
   - Iterate through each character in the string:
     - If the character is an opening parenthesis `(`, push it onto the stack.
     - If the character is a closing parenthesis `)`:
       - Check if the stack is empty:
         - If empty, it indicates an unmatched closing parenthesis, so increment the result counter (`res`).
         - If not empty, pop from the stack, indicating a matched pair.

2. **Final Count**:
   - After iterating through the string, any remaining opening parentheses in the stack are unmatched, so add their count to `res`.

### Code Walk-through
- Initialize a result counter `res` to 0 and a stack `stk` for unmatched opening parentheses.
- Loop through each character in the string:
  - For `(`: push onto the stack.
  - For `)`: check the stack and update `res` accordingly.
- Finally, add the size of the stack (unmatched `(`) to `res`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, since we traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case for the stack when all characters are `(`.
