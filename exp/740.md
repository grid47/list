### Problem Statement
You are given an array `nums` of integers. You can perform the following operation: Choose any number `x` in `nums`, earn `x` points, and delete `x`, as well as all instances of `x-1` and `x+1` from the array. Your goal is to maximize the points you earn by performing this operation multiple times.

### Approach
1. **Create Value Array**:
   - Create an array `val` where `val[i]` represents the total points earned by choosing the number `i` (i.e., the sum of all occurrences of `i` in `nums`).
   - Loop through the `nums` array to populate the `val` array.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - Initialize a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum points that can be earned considering the numbers from `0` to `i`.
   - Set `dp[0]` to `0` (no points if there are no numbers).
   - Set `dp[1]` to `val[0]` (points earned by deleting `0`).

3. **Fill DP Array**:
   - Use a loop to fill the `dp` array from `1` to `n` (the maximum number in `nums`):
     - For each `i`, compute `dp[i + 1]` as the maximum of not taking `i` (`dp[i]`) or taking `i` (`dp[i - 1] + val[i]`).

4. **Return Result**:
   - The answer is found in `dp[n]`, which gives the maximum points that can be earned.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N + M), where N is the size of the `nums` array and M is the maximum number in `nums` (in this case, a constant 10000).
- **Space Complexity**: O(M) for the `val` and `dp` arrays, which store the cumulative values and the maximum points.

### Example
For `nums = [3, 4, 2]`:
- Calculate `val` array: `val[2] = 2`, `val[3] = 3`, `val[4] = 4`.
- The dynamic programming states would be:
  - `dp[3] = max(dp[2], dp[1] + val[3])`
  - `dp[4] = max(dp[3], dp[2] + val[4])`
- The result will be `6`, as you can delete `3` and `4` for a total of `3 + 4 = 7`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the main method for processing the `nums` array.

- **Method**:
  - `int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums)`: Implements the logic to compute the maximum points that can be earned.
