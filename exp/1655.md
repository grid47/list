### Problem Statement

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to distribute a certain quantity of items (represented by `quantity`) among distinct types of items (represented by `nums`). Each type of item can be collected in various quantities, and the goal is to ensure that all quantities are fully satisfied with the items available.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we use a backtracking approach with memoization, effectively exploring all possible distributions of items. The approach is based on the following steps:

1. **Count Frequencies**: Count the frequency of each distinct item in `nums` to determine how many of each type we have available for distribution.

2. **Calculate Costs**: Generate a cost array that represents the number of items required for each combination of quantities in `quantity`.

3. **Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking**: Use a dynamic programming (DP) approach, combined with bitmasking, to explore all combinations of quantities and check if they can be satisfied with the available frequencies.

4. **Memoization**: Cache the results of previously computed states to avoid redundant calculations, thereby optimizing the performance.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Letâ€™s break down the provided code to understand its workings:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    
    int m;
    vector<int> q, frq, cost;
    vector<vector<int>> memo;    
```
- We define a class `Solution` and declare necessary member variables:
  - `m`: Number of distinct quantities.
  - `q`: Vector to hold the quantities.
  - `frq`: Vector to hold the frequency of items available for distribution.
  - `cost`: Vector to compute the cost associated with each possible subset of quantities.
  - `memo`: A 2D vector for memoization to store results of previous computations.

```cpp
    bool dp(int idx, int msk) {
        if(msk == ((1 << m) - 1)) return true;
        if(idx == frq.size()) return false;
```
- The `dp` function is defined to check if a valid distribution exists starting from index `idx` and bitmask `msk` representing the quantities already satisfied. 
- The base case checks:
  - If `msk` equals `((1 << m) - 1)`, it means all quantities have been satisfied, and we return `true`.
  - If we have exhausted the frequency list (`idx` equals the size of `frq`), we return `false`.

```cpp
        if(memo[idx][msk] != -1) return memo[idx][msk];
```
- We check if the current state has been computed before (memoized). If yes, we return the stored result.

```cpp
        for(int i = msk + 1; i < (1 << m); i++) {
            if((msk != (msk & i))) continue;
            if(frq[idx] >= (cost[i] - cost[msk])) {
                if(dp(idx + 1, i)) return memo[idx][msk]= true;
            }
        }
```
- We iterate over all possible masks from `msk + 1` to `2^m - 1`. For each mask:
  - We ensure that the current mask does not overlap with the previous one (`msk`).
  - We check if the available frequency `frq[idx]` can satisfy the difference in costs between the current mask `i` and the previous mask `msk`.
  - If it can, we recursively call `dp` for the next index and the new mask. If this call returns `true`, we store the result in `memo` and return `true`.

```cpp
        return memo[idx][msk] = dp(idx + 1, msk);
    }
```
- If none of the conditions are satisfied, we proceed by checking the next index with the same mask and store the result in `memo`.

```cpp
    bool canDistribute(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& quantity) {
        q = quantity;
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        for(int x: nums) mp[x]++;
```
- The `canDistribute` function begins by initializing `q` with the quantities and counting the frequency of each distinct item in `nums` using a hash map `mp`.

```cpp
        for(auto [key, val] : mp) frq.push_back(val);        
```
- We populate the `frq` vector with the counted frequencies.

```cpp
        m = q.size();
        cost.resize(1 << m, 0);
        for(int msk = 0; msk < (1 << m); msk++) {
            int net = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
                if(msk & (1 << i)) net += q[i];
            cost[msk] = net;
        }
```
- We determine the number of distinct quantities `m` and initialize the `cost` array.
- For each possible mask, we calculate the total quantity required for that combination of quantities.

```cpp
        memo.resize(frq.size(), vector<int>(1025, -1));
        return dp(0, 0);
    }
};
```
- We initialize the memoization table with size based on the frequency and set initial values to -1.
- Finally, we call the `dp` function starting from index 0 and an empty mask to check if a valid distribution is possible.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The time complexity is \( O(n \cdot 2^m) \), where \( n \) is the number of distinct item frequencies and \( m \) is the number of distinct quantities. This is because we explore each subset of quantities and for each frequency, we may need to compute multiple states.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \( O(n + 2^m) \) for storing the frequencies, costs, and the memoization table. This space is primarily occupied by the frequency list and the memoization structure.

### Conclusion

The `canDistribute` function efficiently checks if the quantities can be distributed among the available items using a combination of dynamic programming and bitmasking techniques. By leveraging memoization, the solution avoids redundant computations and optimizes performance, making it suitable for larger input sizes.

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking**: This approach is particularly effective in problems involving combinations and subsets, allowing for efficient state management and exploration.
2. **Use of Memoization**: Caching intermediate results significantly reduces computation time by preventing redundant calculations.
3. **Versatility**: The principles demonstrated in this problem can be applied to similar distribution problems, showcasing the flexibility of the dynamic programming approach.

This solution highlights the power of dynamic programming in solving combinatorial problems and the importance of optimizing state transitions to achieve efficient solutions.
