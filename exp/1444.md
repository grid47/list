### Problem Statement

The problem is to determine how many ways you can cut a pizza (represented as a grid of characters) into `k` pieces such that each piece contains at least one slice of apple ('A'). The pizza is represented as a two-dimensional grid of characters, where each cell can either be 'A' (indicating the presence of an apple) or '.' (indicating an empty cell). The goal is to count the distinct ways to make these cuts while ensuring that each piece has at least one apple.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we will use a combination of depth-first search (DFS) and dynamic programming (DP). The strategy involves:

1. **Precomputation with Prefix Sums**: Create a prefix sum array that allows us to quickly check the number of apples in any subgrid of the pizza.

2. **DFS with Memoization**: Use DFS to explore the possible cuts of the pizza. For each position, recursively check how many valid ways exist to make a cut while reducing the number of pieces left to cut (`k`).

3. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Store results in a 3D DP table to avoid redundant calculations for the same state.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's break down the code provided into understandable sections:

1. **Class Definition**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   ```

   - We define a class named `Solution` which will contain the method to calculate the number of ways to cut the pizza.

2. **Main Method**:
   ```cpp
   int ways(vector<string>& pizza, int k) {
   ```

   - The method `ways` takes a 2D vector of strings representing the pizza and an integer `k` representing the number of pieces to cut the pizza into.

3. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int m = pizza.size(), n = pizza[0].size();
   vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp = vector(k, vector(m, vector(n, -1)));
   vector<vector<int>> preSum = vector(m+1, vector(n+1, 0));
   ```

   - We initialize variables `m` and `n` to represent the dimensions of the pizza.
   - We create a 3D DP vector `dp` initialized to -1, where `dp[k][r][c]` represents the number of ways to cut the pizza starting from cell `(r, c)` with `k` pieces remaining.
   - We also create a 2D prefix sum vector `preSum` to quickly calculate the number of apples in any subgrid.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   ```cpp
   for (int r = m - 1; r >= 0; r--)
       for (int c = n - 1; c >= 0; c--)
           preSum[r][c] = preSum[r][c+1] + preSum[r+1][c] - preSum[r+1][c+1] + (pizza[r][c] == 'A');
   ```

   - We compute the prefix sums by iterating from the bottom-right corner of the pizza grid. This allows us to efficiently count the number of apples in any rectangle defined by two corners in constant time.

5. **DFS Call**:
   ```cpp
   return dfs(m, n, k-1, 0, 0, dp, preSum);
   ```

   - We initiate the DFS process starting from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` of the pizza with `k-1` pieces remaining (since the first piece is already counted).

6. **DFS Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   int dfs(int m, int n, int k, int r, int c, vector<vector<vector<int>>>& dp, vector<vector<int>>& preSum) {
   ```

   - The `dfs` function is defined to explore the pizza recursively. It takes the current position `(r, c)`, the number of remaining pieces `k`, and the `dp` and `preSum` structures.

7. **Base Cases**:
   ```cpp
   if (preSum[r][c] == 0) return 0; 
   if (k == 0) return 1; 
   if (dp[k][r][c] != -1) return dp[k][r][c];
   ```

   - We check:
     - If there are no apples in the remaining part of the pizza starting from `(r, c)`, return 0 (no valid cuts).
     - If `k` is 0 (no more pieces left to cut), return 1 (one valid way to have cut the pizza).
     - If we have already computed the result for this state, return it.

8. **Recursive Case**:
   ```cpp
   int ans = 0;

   for (int nr = r + 1; nr < m; nr++) 
       if (preSum[r][c] - preSum[nr][c] > 0)
           ans = (ans + dfs(m, n, k - 1, nr, c, dp, preSum)) % 1000000007;

   for (int nc = c + 1; nc < n; nc++) 
       if (preSum[r][c] - preSum[r][nc] > 0)
           ans = (ans + dfs(m, n, k - 1, r, nc, dp, preSum)) % 1000000007;
   ```

   - We initialize `ans` to count the number of valid ways.
   - We check all possible horizontal cuts from the current row `r` to every row below it.
   - We check all possible vertical cuts from the current column `c` to every column to the right.
   - If cutting the pizza at that point results in a valid piece containing at least one apple, we proceed with the recursive DFS call.

9. **Store and Return Result**:
   ```cpp
   return dp[k][r][c] = ans;
   ```

   - Finally, we store the result in the DP table and return it.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m^2 \cdot n^2 \cdot k)\). The nested loops involve iterating over the grid and performing the DFS, leading to a significant number of recursive calls.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(m \cdot n \cdot k)\) due to the DP table and the prefix sum array.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently counts the number of ways to cut a pizza into `k` pieces, each containing at least one apple, using a combination of DFS and dynamic programming. The use of a prefix sum array allows for quick checks of the number of apples in subgrids, and memoization avoids redundant calculations. 

#### Key Takeaways:

1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**: This approach allows for efficient solving of problems with overlapping subproblems, such as counting distinct configurations.

2. **Prefix Sums**: Using prefix sums can greatly speed up the process of checking conditions in subarrays, especially when dealing with grid-like structures.

3. **DFS for Combinatorial Problems**: Depth-first search is a powerful technique for exploring possible configurations or combinations, especially in grid or tree-like structures.

In summary, the provided code effectively demonstrates a solution to a complex combinatorial problem, making it a valuable reference for similar challenges in competitive programming and algorithm design.
