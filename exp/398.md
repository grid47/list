### üöÄ Problem Statement

The task is to create an efficient solution for picking a random index from an array `nums` where a specific target value occurs. We need to implement a `pick` method that, given a target value, randomly returns an index from the array `nums` where the target exists. The solution should be time and space-efficient, especially when dealing with multiple occurrences of the target value.

### üß† Approach

To tackle this problem, we need to focus on:
1. **Efficient Storage**: Storing the indices of all occurrences of each value in the array. This allows us to quickly retrieve all indices corresponding to a target value.
2. **Efficient Retrieval**: The goal is to pick a random index from the stored list of indices for the target value. By using a random number generator, we can easily select a random index from the list.
3. **Time Complexity**: The `pick` method should ideally run in constant time (`O(1)`), after initializing the storage.
4. **Space Complexity**: The space required for storing indices must be managed effectively, without consuming excessive memory.

### üî® Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Let‚Äôs walk through the code to understand how this problem is solved efficiently:

#### Step 1: Class Definition
```cpp
class Solution {
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> mp;
```
- The `Solution` class contains an unordered map `mp`. The key is an integer, and the value is a vector that stores the indices where that integer appears in the array.

#### Step 2: Constructor to Initialize the Map
```cpp
public:
    Solution(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            mp[nums[i]].push_back(i);
    }
```
- The constructor takes a reference to a vector `nums`, which is the input array.
- The loop iterates over the array, and for each element `nums[i]`, it adds its index `i` to the vector corresponding to `nums[i]` in the `mp` map.
  - Example: For `nums = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]`, the map `mp` will look like:
    ```cpp
    {
      1: [0, 3],
      2: [1, 4],
      3: [2]
    }
    ```

#### Step 3: Pick Method to Randomly Select an Index
```cpp
    int pick(int target) { 
        int sz = mp[target].size();
        int res = mp[target][rand() % sz];
        return res;
    }
```
- The `pick` method takes an integer `target` and performs the following:
  1. **Find the Size of the Target‚Äôs Index List**:
     - `sz = mp[target].size()` gets the number of indices where the target value occurs.
  2. **Generate a Random Index**:
     - `rand() % sz` generates a random index between `0` and `sz - 1`.
  3. **Return the Random Index**:
     - The random index is selected from `mp[target]`, and that index is returned.

#### Step 4: Example Usage
```cpp
/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution* obj = new Solution(nums);
 * int param_1 = obj->pick(target);
 */
```
- You instantiate the `Solution` object with `nums` and then call `pick` with a target value to get a random index of that target.

### üìà Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **Constructor**: The constructor iterates through the array `nums` to build the map. This takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the size of the array.
- **Pick Method**: Accessing the list of indices for a target is `O(1)`, and generating a random index using `rand()` is also `O(1)`. So, the `pick` method runs in constant time, i.e., `O(1)`.

Thus, the time complexity is:
- **Initialization**: `O(n)`
- **Pick Operation**: `O(1)`

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is determined by the size of the map `mp`, which stores the indices of each value in the array. In the worst case, the map stores all `n` indices if all elements in `nums` are unique.
  
Thus, the space complexity is `O(n)`.

### üèÅ Conclusion

This approach efficiently handles the problem of picking a random index for a target value in an array. By storing all the indices of each value in a map, we can quickly retrieve the list of indices for any target. Using a random number generator allows us to pick a random index in constant time. 

With a time complexity of `O(n)` for initialization and `O(1)` for each pick operation, and a space complexity of `O(n)` to store the indices, this solution is both time-efficient and space-efficient. It‚Äôs an ideal choice for large datasets!

### üîë Key Takeaways:
- Efficient storage of indices using a map allows fast access and random index selection.
- Time complexity for initialization is linear (`O(n)`), while each pick operation is constant time (`O(1)`).
- Space complexity is linear (`O(n)`), based on the storage of indices in the map.

With this solution, you're all set to handle any large array and pick random indices with ease! üí°üéØ
