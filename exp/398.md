### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums`, and you need to design a data structure that supports the following operations:

1. **Constructor**: Initializes the data structure with the given array `nums`.
2. **pick**: Returns a random index of the target number from `nums`. If the target number does not exist in the array, it should not return anything.

### Approach
1. **Store Indices**:
   - Use an `unordered_map` to map each unique number in `nums` to a vector of indices where that number appears. This allows for efficient lookup of indices for the `pick` operation.

2. **Constructor**:
   - In the constructor, iterate through the `nums` array and populate the `unordered_map` where each key is the number and the value is a vector containing the indices of that number.

3. **Pick Operation**:
   - For the `pick` method, retrieve the vector of indices for the given target number.
   - Use `rand() % sz` to select a random index from this vector, where `sz` is the size of the vector. This provides a uniform random selection from the available indices of the target.

### Code Walk-through
- The `Solution` class is initialized with the array `nums`, and during initialization, it builds the mapping of numbers to their indices.
- The `pick` method uses the mapping to randomly return an index of the specified target.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Constructor: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums` (to build the mapping).
  - Pick: O(1) for accessing the vector and selecting a random index.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), to store the mapping of each number to its indices.
