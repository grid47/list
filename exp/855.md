### Problem Statement
You are tasked with designing an `ExamRoom` class to manage seating in a linear exam room. The room has `n` seats, numbered from `0` to `n-1`. You need to implement two operations:
1. **`seat()`**: This method should return the index of the seat that should be occupied, ensuring that the student seated is maximally distant from the others already seated.
2. **`leave(int p)`**: This method allows a student to vacate the seat at index `p`.

### Approach
1. **Data Structure**:
   - Use a vector `L` to store the indices of occupied seats.
   - Maintain the total number of seats, `N`.

2. **`seat()` Method**:
   - If no seats are occupied, seat the first student at index `0`.
   - Calculate the maximum distance from the nearest occupied seat:
     - Check the distance from the start of the row to the first occupied seat.
     - Check the distance from the last occupied seat to the end of the row.
     - Check the distances between occupied seats and find the midpoint for maximum distance.
   - Insert the new seat into the vector `L` based on the calculated maximum distance.

3. **`leave(int p)` Method**:
   - Search for the index `p` in `L` and remove it to free up the seat.

### Code Walk-through
- The `ExamRoom` constructor initializes the room with `n` seats.
- The `seat` method finds the best seat based on the maximum distance calculation and updates the list of occupied seats accordingly.
- The `leave` method removes a specified seat from the list of occupied seats.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - `seat()`: O(m) in the worst case, where m is the number of occupied seats, for distance calculations and insertion.
  - `leave()`: O(m) for finding and removing the seat.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m) for storing the occupied seat indices in the vector `L`.
