### Problem Statement
The goal is to calculate the number of unique substrings in a given string where each character contributes to a unique letter count.

### Approach
1. **Index Tracking**: Maintain a list to track the last two occurrences of each character (A-Z) in the string. This helps in calculating contributions for each character effectively.
2. **Contribution Calculation**: For each character, calculate its contribution to the result based on its current position and its last two recorded positions:
   - The contribution is derived from the distance between the current index, the previous occurrence, and the occurrence before that.
3. **Final Contribution**: After processing all characters, calculate the contribution for each character for the remaining part of the string (from its last occurrence to the end).

### Code Walk-through
- The `idx` array keeps track of the last two positions of each character.
- The loop iterates through the string, updating the contribution based on the distances derived from the indices.
- A second loop ensures that any characters still present in the string after their last recorded position contribute to the result.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N) where N is the length of the string, as we make a single pass to compute contributions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the fixed-size array storing indices (constant space since it only holds data for 26 letters).
