### Problem Statement
The problem involves recovering a binary tree that has been corrupted such that all nodes have been set to `NULL`. Given a binary tree that represents a unique structure where nodes should have values derived from their positions, the task is to reconstruct the values based on the binary tree's structure. The values should be assigned such that:
- The value of the root node is `0`.
- For any node with value `x`, the left child node should have a value of `2 * x + 1`, and the right child should have a value of `2 * x + 2`.

After recovering the values of the binary tree nodes, we should provide a method to determine if a given target value exists in the recovered tree.

### Approach
To solve this problem, we will implement the following steps:
1. **Recursive Recovery**: Create a recursive function to traverse the tree and assign values to each node based on its position.
2. **Storage of Values**: Utilize a data structure (such as an unordered set) to store the recovered values for quick lookups.
3. **Find Method**: Implement a method to check if a target value exists within the recovered values.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
```
- **Lines 1-10**: The definition of the `TreeNode` structure, which represents a node in a binary tree. It contains an integer value (`val`), pointers to the left child (`left`), and the right child (`right`). It includes constructors for easy initialization of tree nodes.

```cpp
class FindElements {
    unordered_set<int> set;
```
- **Line 11**: The class `FindElements` is defined. Within this class, we declare an unordered set named `set` to store the recovered values from the binary tree.

```cpp
public:
    void recover(TreeNode* root, int x) {
        if(root == NULL) return;
        root->val = x;
        set.emplace(x);
        recover(root->left, 2*x+1);
        recover(root->right, 2*x+2);
    }
```
- **Line 12-18**: The `recover` function is defined. This is a recursive function that assigns values to the tree nodes.
  - **Line 13**: If the current node (`root`) is `NULL`, the function returns, terminating that branch of recursion.
  - **Line 14**: The value of the current node is set to `x`.
  - **Line 15**: The value `x` is added to the unordered set `set`, ensuring all unique values are stored for later lookups.
  - **Line 16-17**: The function recursively calls itself for the left and right children of the current node. The left child's value is set to `2 * x + 1`, and the right child's value is set to `2 * x + 2`, thus adhering to the problem's requirements.

```cpp
    FindElements(TreeNode* root) {
        recover(root, 0);
    }
```
- **Line 19-21**: The constructor for the `FindElements` class initializes the object with the given tree root. It calls the `recover` function with the root and the initial value `0`.

```cpp
    bool find(int target) {
        return set.count(target);
    }
};
```
- **Line 22-25**: The `find` method checks whether a given `target` value exists in the unordered set `set`. The `count` function of the unordered set returns `1` if the value exists and `0` otherwise, enabling an efficient search operation.

```cpp
/**
 * Your FindElements object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * FindElements* obj = new FindElements(root);
 * bool param_1 = obj->find(target);
 */
```
- **Lines 26-29**: This commented section provides an example of how to instantiate the `FindElements` class and use the `find` method to check for the presence of a target value.

### Complexity Analysis
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The recovery of the tree through the `recover` method takes \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once to assign its value.
   - The `find` method operates in \(O(1)\) on average due to the properties of the unordered set, providing constant time complexity for lookups.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is \(O(n)\) as we are storing the values of all \(n\) nodes in the unordered set `set`.

### Conclusion
The `FindElements` class provides an efficient way to recover a binary tree's node values based on a specific structure and enables rapid queries to check for the existence of these values. By utilizing recursive depth-first traversal to assign values and an unordered set for quick lookups, this solution achieves optimal time and space complexity.

This approach demonstrates not only the ability to manipulate tree structures in C++ but also the effectiveness of using data structures like sets for efficient data retrieval. The combination of these techniques makes the `FindElements` class a robust solution for the problem at hand, illustrating key concepts in data structures and algorithm design.
