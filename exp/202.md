### üöÄ Problem Statement

We‚Äôre tackling the **happy number** problem! A **happy number** follows a unique process:

1. Start with any positive integer `n`.
2. Replace `n` with the sum of the squares of its digits.
3. Repeat this until either:
   - The number becomes `1` (indicating it‚Äôs a happy number!).
   - Or the number falls into a never-ending cycle that doesn‚Äôt include `1` (in which case, it‚Äôs not a happy number).

For example:
- **Input:** `19`
- **Output:** `True` (because the sequence of squares eventually reaches `1`).

### üß† Approach

To solve this problem, we need to determine if summing the squares of the digits of a number `n` leads to `1` or falls into a cycle. If we find a cycle, the number is not happy.

To detect cycles, we‚Äôll use **Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm** (a.k.a. the **tortoise and hare** algorithm). This algorithm uses two pointers:
- **Slow pointer** moves one step at a time.
- **Fast pointer** moves two steps at a time.

If the two pointers meet, a cycle is detected. If they meet at `1`, the number is happy!

#### Key Steps:
1. Create a helper function `sqr(int n)` to calculate the sum of the squares of the digits of `n`.
2. Use two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) to repeatedly compute the sum of squares and check for a cycle.
3. If the two pointers meet at `1`, the number is happy.
4. If they meet at any other value, a cycle exists, and the number is not happy.

### üî® Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Let‚Äôs break it down step by step:

#### Step 1: Helper Function `sqr(int n)`
```cpp
int sqr(int n) {
    int res = 0;
    while(n) {
        int tmp = n % 10;   // Get the last digit
        res += tmp * tmp;    // Add the square of the digit
        n = n / 10;          // Remove the last digit
    }
    return res;
}
```
- **Purpose:** This function computes the sum of the squares of the digits of `n`.
- **How it works:** 
  - We loop through each digit of `n`, square it, and add it to the result.
  - The last digit is removed after processing with `n = n / 10`.
  - The function returns the sum of the squares.

#### Step 2: Main Function `isHappy(int n)`
```cpp
bool isHappy(int n) {
    int slow = n;
    int fast = n;
    do {
        slow = sqr(slow);   // Move slow pointer one step
        fast = sqr(sqr(fast)); // Move fast pointer two steps
    } while(slow != fast);
    return slow == 1;  // If slow reaches 1, it's a happy number
}
```
- **Purpose:** This function checks whether `n` is a happy number using Floyd‚Äôs Cycle-Finding Algorithm.
- **How it works:**
  - Both the slow and fast pointers start at `n`.
  - The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
  - We keep moving the pointers until they meet. If they meet at `1`, the number is happy, so we return `true`.
  - If they meet at any other value, a cycle is detected, and we return `false`.

### üìà Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(log n):** The `sqr` function runs in **O(log n)** because the number of digits in `n` is proportional to `log n`. The `do-while` loop runs until a cycle is detected or the slow pointer reaches `1`. In the worst case, the number of iterations is proportional to the number of distinct values that can be reached by summing the squares of the digits, which is small and bounded. So, the time complexity is **O(log n)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** We only use two pointers (`slow` and `fast`), so the space complexity is constant. No additional data structures are required.

### üèÅ Conclusion

We‚Äôve successfully solved the happy number problem using **Floyd‚Äôs Cycle-Finding Algorithm**. This method is:
1. **Efficient:** The algorithm runs in **O(log n)** time, making it optimal for large inputs.
2. **Space Optimized:** The space complexity is **O(1)**, which means it uses minimal memory.
3. **Clever:** By using the tortoise and hare approach, we can efficiently detect cycles without storing all previous values, making this solution both elegant and memory-friendly.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Cycle detection** ensures we don‚Äôt fall into infinite loops.
- **Efficiency** is achieved with logarithmic time complexity.
- **Space savings** make the solution ideal for memory-constrained environments.

So, next time you face a number and wonder whether it's happy, you‚Äôve got a smooth, efficient solution ready to go! Keep coding and keep exploring! üåü
