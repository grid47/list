### Problem Statement
A "happy number" is defined as a number which eventually reaches `1` when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit. If it does not reach `1`, it enters a cycle that does not include `1`. The task is to determine if a given number `n` is a happy number.

### Approach
1. **Sum of Squares of Digits**:
   - Create a helper function `sqr(int n)` that computes the sum of the squares of the digits of `n`.

2. **Floyd's Cycle Detection**:
   - Use the slow and fast pointer technique to detect cycles. This involves two pointers:
     - `slow` moves one step at a time (calculating the sum of squares).
     - `fast` moves two steps at a time (calculating the sum of squares twice).

3. **Loop Until Convergence**:
   - Continue updating the `slow` and `fast` pointers until they meet (indicating a cycle) or until `slow` reaches `1`.

4. **Result**:
   - If `slow` equals `1`, then `n` is a happy number; otherwise, it is not.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the class `Solution`.
- **Line 2**: Define the helper function `sqr(int n)` that computes the sum of squares of the digits of `n`.
- **Lines 3-8**: 
  - Inside the `sqr` function, calculate the sum of squares by extracting each digit and adding its square to `res`.
- **Line 9**: Define the function `isHappy(int n)`.
- **Line 10**: Initialize both `slow` and `fast` pointers to `n`.
- **Lines 11-15**: 
  - Use a do-while loop to update the `slow` and `fast` pointers using the `sqr` function until they are equal.
- **Line 16**: Return `true` if `slow` is `1`, indicating that `n` is a happy number.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is not straightforward due to the potential cycles, but in practice, it is \(O(\log n)\) on average, as the number of digits decreases.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) since we use a constant amount of space for variables and do not use any additional data structures.
