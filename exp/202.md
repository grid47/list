### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to determine whether a given number `n` is a **happy number** or not. A **happy number** is defined as follows:

1. Starting with any positive integer `n`, replace `n` by the sum of the squares of its digits.
2. Repeat this process until either:
   - The number becomes `1` (in which case, the number is happy).
   - The number loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include `1` (in which case, the number is not happy).

For example:
- **Input:** `19`
- **Output:** `True` (since `1^2 + 9^2 = 82`, `8^2 + 2^2 = 68`, `6^2 + 8^2 = 100`, `1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1`).

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to determine whether the process of summing the squares of the digits of a number `n` leads to a cycle or to `1`. If it leads to `1`, the number is happy, and if it leads to a cycle, the number is not happy.

One way to detect cycles is by using the **Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm** (also known as the **tortoise and hare** algorithm). This approach uses two pointers:
- The **slow pointer** moves one step at a time.
- The **fast pointer** moves two steps at a time.

If the two pointers meet at some point, a cycle is detected. If they meet at `1`, it indicates the number is happy.

#### Key Steps:
1. Define a helper function `sqr(int n)` that computes the sum of the squares of the digits of `n`.
2. Use two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) to repeatedly compute the sum of squares and check for a cycle.
3. If the two pointers meet at `1`, the number is happy.
4. If the two pointers meet at a value other than `1`, a cycle exists, and the number is not happy.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Helper Function `sqr(int n)`
```cpp
int sqr(int n) {
    int res = 0;
    while(n) {
        int tmp = n % 10;   // Get the last digit of the number
        res += tmp * tmp;    // Add the square of the digit to the result
        n = n / 10;          // Remove the last digit from the number
    }
    return res;
}
```
- **Purpose:** This function calculates the sum of the squares of the digits of the integer `n`.
- **Explanation:** 
  - The `while` loop runs as long as `n` is non-zero.
  - Inside the loop, the last digit of `n` is obtained using `n % 10`, and the square of the digit is added to `res`.
  - The last digit is then removed from `n` using `n = n / 10`.
  - The function returns `res`, which is the sum of the squares of the digits of `n`.

#### Step 2: Main Function `isHappy(int n)`
```cpp
bool isHappy(int n) {
    int slow = n;
    int fast = n;
    do {
        slow = sqr(slow);   // Move the slow pointer one step
        fast = sqr(sqr(fast)); // Move the fast pointer two steps
    } while(slow != fast);
    return slow == 1;  // If slow pointer reaches 1, return true (happy number)
}
```
- **Purpose:** This function checks whether the given number `n` is a happy number using Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm.
- **Explanation:**
  - The `slow` and `fast` pointers are both initialized to `n`.
  - In each iteration of the `do-while` loop:
    - The slow pointer moves one step at a time by calling `sqr(slow)`.
    - The fast pointer moves two steps at a time by calling `sqr(sqr(fast))`.
  - The loop continues until the `slow` and `fast` pointers meet. If they meet at `1`, the function returns `true`, indicating that the number is happy.
  - If the pointers meet at any other value, a cycle is detected, and the function returns `false`, indicating that the number is not happy.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(log n):** 
  - The sum of squares function (`sqr`) runs in **O(log n)** because the number of digits in `n` is proportional to `log n`.
  - The `do-while` loop runs until a cycle is detected or the slow pointer reaches `1`. In the worst case, the number of iterations is bounded by the number of distinct values that can be reached by repeatedly summing the squares of digits. This value is typically small for most numbers, but it is influenced by the number of digits in `n`, which is **O(log n)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** 
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space because only two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) are maintained, and no additional data structures are used.

### Conclusion

The given solution solves the problem of determining whether a number is happy efficiently using Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm. This approach has several advantages:
1. **Cycle Detection:** It uses the well-known tortoise and hare method to detect cycles in a sequence, ensuring that we do not fall into an infinite loop.
2. **Efficient:** The algorithm runs in logarithmic time with respect to the number of digits in the input number, which is optimal for this problem.
3. **Space Optimized:** The space complexity is constant, making the solution memory-efficient.

This method is ideal for checking whether a number is happy, as it avoids the need for storing previously computed values and effectively detects cycles without excessive memory usage.
