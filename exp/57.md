### Problem Statement
You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `it` sorted by their start times, and a new interval `n`. Your task is to insert the new interval into the intervals array, merging any overlapping intervals.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Create an empty result vector `ans` to store the merged intervals.
   - Use an index `i` to traverse the intervals.

2. **Add Non-Overlapping Intervals**:
   - Add all intervals from `it` that end before the new interval starts (`it[i][1] < n[0]`) to `ans`.

3. **Merge Overlapping Intervals**:
   - While there are overlapping intervals (i.e., intervals in `it` that start before or when the new interval ends), merge them into the new interval `n`. This is done by updating `n` to have the minimum start and maximum end of the overlapping intervals.

4. **Add the Merged Interval**:
   - After merging, add the updated `n` to `ans`.

5. **Add Remaining Intervals**:
   - Append the remaining intervals from `it` that start after the new interval ends to `ans`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Initialization**:
   - An empty result vector `ans` is created, and an index `i` is initialized to zero.
- **Iterate through intervals**:
   - First loop: Add non-overlapping intervals to `ans`.
   - Second loop: Merge overlapping intervals.
   - Third loop: Add any remaining intervals.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of intervals, since each interval is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) in the worst case to store the merged intervals.
