### Problem Statement

The problem at hand involves inserting a new interval into a list of non-overlapping intervals, and returning the list of intervals after the insertion while maintaining the sorted order. The new interval may overlap with some of the existing intervals, so the task is to merge the overlapping intervals after the insertion.

For example, given a list of intervals:
```
[[1, 3], [6, 9]]
```
and a new interval `[2, 5]`, after inserting the new interval and merging the overlapping intervals, the result should be:
```
[[1, 5], [6, 9]]
```

### Approach

The approach to solving this problem is straightforward and involves the following key steps:

1. **Insert the new interval** in the correct position in the list of existing intervals.
2. **Merge overlapping intervals** if necessary.
3. **Return the resulting list** after the insertion and merging.

We can break the solution down into three major steps:
- First, we will add all intervals that are completely before the new interval.
- Then, we will merge any overlapping intervals.
- Finally, we will add all the remaining intervals that are after the new merged interval.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> ans;
int i = 0;
```

- **`ans`:** This is the result vector that will store the final list of intervals after inserting and merging.
- **`i`:** This variable is used to iterate through the list of existing intervals `it`.

#### Step 2: Add Intervals Before the New Interval

```cpp
while(i < it.size() && it[i][1] < n[0]) {
    ans.push_back(it[i]);
    i++;
}
```

- In this step, we iterate through the list of existing intervals `it` and add all intervals that are completely before the new interval `n`.
- An interval `[a, b]` is considered completely before `n` if its end time `b` is less than the start time of `n`, i.e., `it[i][1] < n[0]`.
- These intervals are added directly to the result vector `ans`.

#### Step 3: Merge Overlapping Intervals

```cpp
while(i < it.size() && it[i][0] <= n[1]) {
    n = {
        min(it[i][0], n[0]),
        max(it[i][1], n[1])
    };
    i++;
}
```

- After adding all intervals that are before the new interval, we check for overlapping intervals. This step merges the new interval `n` with any overlapping intervals.
- An interval `[a, b]` overlaps with `n` if its start time `a` is less than or equal to the end time of `n` (`it[i][0] <= n[1]`).
- If an overlap is found, we update the new interval `n` by taking the minimum of the start times and the maximum of the end times between the overlapping interval and `n`. This ensures that we merge the intervals.
- The `i++` inside the loop ensures we move to the next interval in the list after merging.

#### Step 4: Add the Merged Interval

```cpp
ans.push_back(n);
```

- After processing all overlapping intervals, we add the merged new interval `n` to the result list `ans`.

#### Step 5: Add Intervals After the Merged Interval

```cpp
while(i < it.size()) {
    ans.push_back(it[i++]);
}
```

- Finally, we add all intervals that come after the newly inserted and merged interval. These intervals do not overlap with the new interval, so they are added as-is to the result list `ans`.

#### Step 6: Return the Result

```cpp
return ans;
```

- After processing all intervals, we return the result vector `ans`, which now contains the list of intervals after inserting and merging the new interval.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

- **O(n):** The time complexity of this solution is linear, O(n), where `n` is the number of intervals in the input list `it`. This is because we go through each interval exactly once, either adding it to the result or merging it with the new interval.
- **Sorting is not required:** We do not need to sort the intervals in this case, as the input intervals are already assumed to be sorted in ascending order.

#### Space Complexity:

- **O(n):** The space complexity is O(n), where `n` is the number of intervals in the input list `it`. This is because we store the result in the vector `ans`, which can hold up to `n+1` intervals in the worst case.

### Conclusion

The problem of inserting a new interval into a list of non-overlapping intervals and merging any overlapping intervals can be efficiently solved using a linear scan of the list. The solution works in O(n) time, where `n` is the number of intervals. By first adding non-overlapping intervals, then merging overlapping ones, and finally adding the remaining intervals, we ensure that the final list of intervals is correctly formed.

This approach is efficient because it leverages the fact that the input intervals are already sorted, eliminating the need for additional sorting operations. The algorithm is straightforward to implement and provides an optimal solution to the problem. The space complexity is also linear, as we store the result in a separate list.
