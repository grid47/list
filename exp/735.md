### Problem Statement
Implement a function to simulate the collision of asteroids represented by integers in an array. Positive integers represent moving right, and negative integers represent moving left. When two asteroids collide, the larger one survives, and the smaller one is destroyed. If they are equal, both are destroyed.

### Approach
1. **Using a Stack**: 
   - Utilize a stack to keep track of the asteroids that survive after collisions.
   - Iterate through each asteroid and determine its behavior based on the current state of the stack.

2. **Collision Logic**:
   - If the current asteroid is moving left (negative) and the top of the stack is moving right (positive), check for collisions.
   - Pop from the stack until the current asteroid either:
     - Survives (if it's larger than the top of the stack).
     - Collides and is destroyed (if it's smaller).
     - Matches the size of the top asteroid (both are destroyed).
   - If no collision occurs (i.e., the current asteroid is moving right or the stack is empty), push the current asteroid onto the stack.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method for asteroid collision handling.

- **Methods**:
  - `vector<int> asteroidCollision(vector<int>& ast)`: Main method that processes the asteroid collisions and returns the resulting array.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of asteroids, as each asteroid is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) in the worst case for the stack when no collisions occur.
