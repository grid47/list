### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Approach
1. **Two-pointer Technique**:
   - Utilize two pointers, `l` starting at the beginning and `r` at the end of the array.
   - Create an output vector `ans` of the same size as `nums` to store the squared values.

2. **Iterate in Reverse**:
   - Loop through the `ans` array from the last index to the first:
     - Calculate the square of the values at the left pointer (`ll = nums[l] * nums[l]`) and the right pointer (`rr = nums[r] * nums[r]`).
     - Compare the squares:
       - If `ll` is less than `rr`, store `rr` in the current position of `ans` and move the right pointer (`r--`).
       - Otherwise, store `ll` and move the left pointer (`l++`).

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After the loop, `ans` will contain the squared values sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Code Walk-through
1. **`sortedSquares` Method**:
   - Initializes the output vector `ans`.
   - Iterates from the end of the `ans` array, performing the square calculations and comparisons, and filling the `ans` array accordingly.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`, since we process each element once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the output vector `ans`.
