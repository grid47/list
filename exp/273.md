### Problem Statement
Convert a non-negative integer `num` into its English words representation. The function should return the corresponding words for the integer, handling numbers up to 2,147,483,647.

### Approach
The solution utilizes a recursive helper function to break down the number into manageable parts (ones, tens, hundreds, and larger units) and converts each part into words.

1. **String Arrays**:
   - `ones`: Maps numbers from 0 to 19 to their English word representation.
   - `tens`: Maps multiples of ten from 20 to 90.
   - `thousands`: Maps larger units (thousand, million, billion).

2. **Recursive Helper Function**:
   - If `n` is less than 20, return the corresponding value from `ones`.
   - If `n` is less than 100, break it down into tens and ones.
   - If `n` is less than 1000, break it down into hundreds, tens, and ones.
   - For larger numbers, recursively break them down by powers of 1000 and append the appropriate unit from `thousands`.

3. **Main Function**:
   - Check if `num` is zero and return "Zero".
   - Otherwise, call the helper function and format the result to remove leading spaces.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A non-negative integer `num`.
- **Output**: A string representing the number in English words.

1. Define arrays for `ones`, `tens`, and `thousands` to map numbers to words.
2. Implement the `helper` function to recursively process the number based on its size.
3. Handle special cases for numbers less than 20, less than 100, and less than 1000.
4. For numbers larger than 999, find the appropriate unit and recursively call `helper`.
5. In the `numberToWords` function, handle the case for zero and format the output properly.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\log n)\), as the number is broken down recursively based on its digits.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) for the string arrays, although recursive call stack space may add overhead.

### Edge Cases
1. **Zero Input**: Should return "Zero".
2. **Max Integer**: Should correctly format the largest number, `2,147,483,647`, as "Two Billion One Hundred Forty-Seven Million Four Hundred Eighty-Three Thousand Six Hundred Forty-Seven".
