### 🚀 Problem Statement

We have a task to convert a given integer `num` (in the range [0, 2^31 - 1]) into its corresponding English words. For example:
- **Input**: `123`
- **Output**: `"One Hundred Twenty Three"`

Your goal is to return the number as a string in English words, and the solution should efficiently handle numbers as large as one billion! 🌍💡

### 🧠 Approach

To solve this problem, we’ll use a **recursive approach** to break the number into smaller, manageable parts and convert each part to its English equivalent. These parts are like building blocks that represent:
- Ones
- Tens
- Hundreds
- Thousands
- Millions
- Billions

By processing these blocks, we can combine them and form the final English sentence. 🛠️✨

Here's how we’ll tackle it:
1. **Arrays for English Words**: We’ll use pre-defined arrays to store words for different ranges (ones, tens, and powers of 1000).
2. **Recursive Breakdown**: We break the number into chunks, and for each chunk, we convert it to words. This is done recursively to handle each part efficiently.
3. **Combining Chunks**: Once we have the words for all chunks, we combine them with their respective scales like thousand, million, or billion.

### 🔨 Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Now let’s dive into the code and see how it works! 👩‍💻💡

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string ones[20] = {"", " One", " Two", " Three", " Four", " Five", " Six", " Seven", " Eight", " Nine", " Ten", " Eleven", " Twelve", " Thirteen", " Fourteen", " Fifteen", " Sixteen", " Seventeen", " Eighteen", " Nineteen"};
    string tens[10] = {"", " Ten", " Twenty", " Thirty", " Forty", " Fifty", " Sixty", " Seventy", " Eighty", " Ninety"};
    string thousands[4] = {"", " Thousand", " Million", " Billion"};
```
1. **Arrays**:
   - `ones[20]`: Holds words for numbers 0 to 19.
   - `tens[10]`: Holds words for multiples of ten (20, 30, ..., 90).
   - `thousands[4]`: Holds words for powers of 1000 (thousand, million, billion).

```cpp
    string helper(int n) {
        if (n < 20) 
            return ones[n];
        if (n < 100) 
            return tens[n / 10] + helper(n % 10);
        if (n < 1000) 
            return helper(n / 100) + " Hundred" + helper(n % 100);
        for (int i = 3; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (n >= pow(1000, i)) {
                return helper(n / pow(1000, i)) + thousands[i] + helper(n % (int)pow(1000, i));
            }
        }
        return "";
    }
```
2. **Helper Function**:
   - This recursive function does the magic of converting the number into words.
   - **Base Case**: If `n < 20`, simply return the corresponding word from the `ones[]` array.
   - For numbers between 20 and 99, it returns the tens place word plus the result of the ones place.
   - For numbers between 100 and 999, it returns the hundreds place word and recursively calls itself for the remainder.
   - For numbers larger than 999 (thousands, millions, billions), it breaks the number into smaller chunks, recursively processes them, and appends the corresponding scale (thousand, million, etc.).

```cpp
    string numberToWords(int num) {
        if (num == 0)  return "Zero";
        return helper(num).substr(1);
    }
};
```
3. **Main Function**:
   - If the number is `0`, return `"Zero"`.
   - Otherwise, call the `helper()` function to convert the number into English words and remove the leading space using `.substr(1)`.

### 📈 Complexity Analysis

Let’s break down the time and space complexities to see how efficient this solution is! ⏱️💡

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(log n)**, where `n` is the input number.
  - The number is divided by powers of 1000 at each recursive step. This means the recursion depth is logarithmic in relation to the number. This ensures our solution runs efficiently, even for large numbers like billions.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(log n)**, primarily due to the recursion stack. Each recursive call involves splitting the number into smaller chunks, which means the depth of recursion is logarithmic in relation to the number.

### 🏁 Conclusion

This solution efficiently converts a number into its corresponding English words using recursion and arrays to store common word patterns. Here’s what makes it so great:

#### Key Benefits:
1. **Logarithmic Time Complexity**: The algorithm is super fast, even for large numbers, with a time complexity of O(log n).
2. **Simple and Elegant**: The recursive approach makes the solution easy to understand and implement, while the use of arrays keeps the code concise and organized.
3. **Space Efficient**: With an O(log n) space complexity, the solution is optimal for handling large inputs without excessive memory usage.

#### Potential Use Cases:
1. **Financial Software**: Converting large amounts into written form (e.g., for checks or invoices).
2. **Document Automation**: Generating reports that require numbers to be written out.
3. **Localization**: Easily adjustable for different languages by modifying the arrays for number words.

This approach strikes a perfect balance between efficiency, clarity, and flexibility. Whether you're dealing with financial applications, documents, or just curious about number conversions, this solution is both fast and easy to use. 🌟🎉
