### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to count the number of teams that can be formed based on the ratings of players, given specific constraints on team composition. A team is defined as a trio of players \( (i, j, k) \) such that \( i < j < k \). The ratings of the players must satisfy one of two conditions:

1. The ratings are in increasing order: \( \text{rate}[i] < \text{rate}[j] < \text{rate}[k] \).
2. The ratings are in decreasing order: \( \text{rate}[i] > \text{rate}[j] > \text{rate}[k] \).

The objective is to find the total number of valid teams that can be formed from the given list of player ratings.

### Approach

To tackle this problem, we utilize a dynamic programming (DP) approach. The key idea is to recursively explore the possibilities of forming valid teams while using memoization to avoid redundant calculations. Here are the steps involved in our approach:

1. **Recursive Function**: We define a recursive function that tries to build teams starting from a given player index. This function will keep track of the current player's index, the previous player's index, and the count of players chosen so far.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If three players have been selected (i.e., the count reaches three), we return 1 to signify that a valid team has been formed.
   - If the index exceeds the size of the rating list, we return 0 since no more players are left to choose from.

3. **Memoization**: We maintain a memoization table to store previously computed results based on the current index, the previous index, and the count of selected players. This significantly speeds up the computation by avoiding recalculating results for the same state.

4. **Choices**:
   - For each player at the current index, we can either include them in the team (if they can form a valid increasing or decreasing sequence with previously selected players) or skip them.
   - We recursively call our function to explore both choices.

5. **Combining Results**: Since we want to count both increasing and decreasing teams, we reverse the list of ratings and apply the same logic to count decreasing teams.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the provided C++ code:

1. **Class Definition**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
   ```
   - The `Solution` class is defined, encapsulating the solution method.

2. **Memoization Table**:
   ```cpp
       int memo[1001][1001][4];
   ```
   - A 3D array `memo` is initialized to store results of subproblems, where:
     - The first dimension represents the current index of the player being considered.
     - The second dimension represents the index of the previously selected player.
     - The third dimension indicates how many players have been selected so far (0 to 3).

3. **Ratings Vector**:
   ```cpp
       vector<int> rate;
   ```
   - A vector to hold the ratings of the players is defined.

4. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   ```cpp
       int dp(int idx, int prv, int cnt) {
   ```
   - The recursive function `dp` takes the current index `idx`, the previous selected player index `prv`, and the count of selected players `cnt`.

5. **Base Cases**:
   ```cpp
           if(cnt == 3) return 1;
           if(idx == rate.size()) return 0;
           if(memo[idx][prv + 1][cnt] != -1) return memo[idx][prv + 1][cnt];
   ```
   - If three players are selected, it returns 1.
   - If the index exceeds the number of players, it returns 0.
   - If the result for the current state is already computed, it is returned from the memoization table.

6. **Selecting Current Player**:
   ```cpp
           int ans = 0;
           if(prv == -1 || rate[idx] > rate[prv]) {
               ans += dp(idx + 1, idx, cnt + 1);
           }
   ```
   - If no previous player has been selected or the current player can form an increasing sequence with the previous player, we recursively count the teams that can be formed by including the current player.

7. **Skipping Current Player**:
   ```cpp
           ans += dp(idx + 1, prv, cnt);
   ```
   - Regardless of the choice made, we also consider the scenario where we skip the current player.

8. **Memoization**:
   ```cpp
           return memo[idx][prv + 1][cnt] = ans;
       }
   ```
   - The result is stored in the memoization table before returning.

9. **Counting Teams**:
   ```cpp
       int numTeams(vector<int>& rate) {
           this->rate = rate;
           memset(memo, -1, sizeof(memo));
           int res1 = dp(0, -1, 0);
   ```
   - The `numTeams` function initializes the ratings and the memoization table.
   - It computes the count of increasing teams starting from the first player.

10. **Reversing Ratings for Decreasing Teams**:
    ```cpp
           reverse(this->rate.begin(), this->rate.end());
           memset(memo, -1, sizeof(memo));        
           int res2 = dp(0, -1, 0);
    ```
    - The ratings are reversed to count decreasing teams.
    - The memoization table is reset, and the count of decreasing teams is computed.

11. **Returning Total Teams**:
    ```cpp
           return res1 + res2;
       }
   };
    ```
    - The total number of valid teams is returned by adding both counts.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The time complexity is \( O(n^2) \), where \( n \) is the size of the ratings array. This is due to the double recursion where we explore choices based on player indices and previously selected players.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \( O(n) \) due to the memoization table used for storing results of subproblems.

### Conclusion

This code effectively solves the problem of counting the number of valid teams that can be formed from player ratings using a dynamic programming approach combined with memoization. 

Key insights from the solution include:
- The importance of systematically exploring choices in a recursive manner while avoiding redundant computations through memoization.
- The ability to count distinct configurations (increasing and decreasing) by leveraging the same logic with slight modifications (reversing the input).
- Understanding how to structure the recursive function to handle base cases and choices intuitively.

Such techniques are crucial for tackling combinatorial problems and can be extended to similar challenges in competitive programming and algorithm design.
