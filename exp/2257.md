### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to determine how many grid cells in an \(m \times n\) grid are **unguarded**. A grid can contain **walls**, **guards**, and **unguarded spaces**. We are given the dimensions of the grid and two lists: one for the positions of the walls and one for the positions of the guards. The challenge is to calculate how many cells are not guarded by any guard and are not blocked by any wall.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can approach it by simulating the process of marking cells in the grid as guarded or blocked:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - We'll represent the grid as a 2D array where each cell can either be empty, contain a wall, or contain a guard. We'll mark the cells as:
     - `0`: Empty space
     - `1`: Wall
     - `2`: Guarded space
     - `3`: Guard (we'll mark the guards explicitly)

2. **Place Walls and Guards**:
   - Start by placing walls and guards in the grid. This step simply assigns the value `1` for walls and `3` for guards at their respective positions.

3. **Mark Guarded Spaces**:
   - A guard can "see" in four directions: up, down, left, and right, until it hits a wall or another guard.
   - For each guard, we will mark all cells it can reach (in the four directions) as **guarded**, denoted by the value `2`.

4. **Count Unguarded Spaces**:
   - After marking all guarded and blocked spaces, the unguarded spaces will be the cells that remain with a value of `0`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - We need to consider scenarios where:
     - There are no guards or walls.
     - The entire grid is blocked by walls.
     - Guards cannot see beyond walls or other guards.
     - All cells are guarded.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize the Grid

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> grid(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
```

- We initialize a 2D grid of size \(m \times n\), where all cells are initially set to `0`, indicating that they are empty (unguarded).

#### Step 2: Place Walls

```cpp
for(auto it: walls) {
    grid[it[0]][it[1]] = 1;
}
```

- For each position in the `walls` array, we mark the corresponding cell in the grid as `1` (wall).

#### Step 3: Place Guards

```cpp
for(auto it: guards) {
    grid[it[0]][it[1]] = 3;
}
```

- Similarly, for each position in the `guards` array, we mark the corresponding cell as `3` (guard).

#### Step 4: Mark Guarded Spaces

```cpp
for(auto it: guards) {
    int x = it[0], y = it[1];

    // Mark right direction
    for(int i = y + 1; i < n && grid[x][i] != 1 && grid[x][i] != 3; i++) {
        grid[x][i] = 2;
    }

    // Mark left direction
    for(int i = y - 1; i >= 0 && grid[x][i] != 1 && grid[x][i] != 3; i--) {
        grid[x][i] = 2;
    }

    // Mark down direction
    for(int i = x + 1; i < m && grid[i][y] != 1 && grid[i][y] != 3; i++) {
        grid[i][y] = 2;
    }

    // Mark up direction
    for(int i = x - 1; i >= 0 && grid[i][y] != 1 && grid[i][y] != 3; i--) {
        grid[i][y] = 2;
    }
}
```

- For each guard:
  - We iterate over the four directions (right, left, down, up).
  - For each direction, we check if the current cell is a wall (`1`) or another guard (`3`). If it's neither, we mark it as guarded (`2`).
  - The guard stops marking spaces as guarded once it hits a wall or another guard.

#### Step 5: Count Unguarded Spaces

```cpp
int cnt = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        if(grid[i][j] == 0) cnt++;
```

- After all guards have marked their reachable spaces, we iterate through the grid again to count the number of unguarded spaces (cells with value `0`).

#### Step 6: Return the Result

```cpp
return cnt;
```

- Finally, we return the count of unguarded cells.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity

- **Placing Walls**: We iterate over the `walls` list, which contains at most `O(m \times n)` elements (in the worst case where all cells are walls).
  - Time complexity: \( O(w) \), where `w` is the number of walls.
  
- **Placing Guards**: Similarly, for each guard, we mark cells in four directions. In the worst case, we might iterate through the entire row or column, so this operation takes \( O(m \times n) \) time for each guard.
  - Time complexity: \( O(g \times (m + n)) \), where `g` is the number of guards.

- **Counting Unguarded Spaces**: We iterate through the entire grid once, which takes \( O(m \times n) \).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \( O(m \times n + g \times (m + n)) \), where `m` and `n` are the grid dimensions, and `g` is the number of guards.

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity is dominated by the space required to store the grid:
- Space complexity: \( O(m \times n) \).

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently calculates the number of unguarded spaces in a grid by marking the regions each guard can reach and counting the remaining unmarked spaces. Using a 2D grid, we can easily track walls, guards, and guarded spaces. The approach ensures that the time complexity remains manageable, even for large grids, by leveraging efficient marking and iteration techniques.
