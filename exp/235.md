### Problem Statement
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes, `p` and `q`. The LCA is defined as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants.

### Approach
In a BST, the value of nodes in the left subtree is smaller than the root, and the value of nodes in the right subtree is larger than the root. Using this property, we can find the LCA by comparing the values of `p` and `q` with the value of the current node (`root`):

1. If both `p` and `q` have values greater than `root`, search in the right subtree.
2. If both `p` and `q` have values less than `root`, search in the left subtree.
3. If one node is on the left and the other is on the right, or one of them is equal to `root`, then `root` is the LCA.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: The root of a BST and two nodes `p` and `q`.
- **Output**: The lowest common ancestor node of `p` and `q`.
- **Base Condition**: Return the `root` node if itâ€™s the LCA.

1. Check if both `p` and `q` values are greater than `root->val`. If so, recursively call on `root->right`.
2. Check if both `p` and `q` values are less than `root->val`. If so, recursively call on `root->left`.
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, return `root` as it is the LCA.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the BST. In the worst case, it requires traversing from the root to the leaf node.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\) for the recursion stack, where \(h\) is the height of the tree.
