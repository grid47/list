### Problem Statement
The task is to find the maximum distance between two consecutive `1`s in the binary representation of a given integer \( n \). The distance is defined as the number of bits between the two `1`s.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `res` is initialized to `0` to keep track of the maximum distance found.
   - `d` is initialized to `-32` to serve as the distance counter, where `-32` is used to accommodate the number of bits in an integer.

2. **Iterate Through Bits**:
   - A loop runs while \( n \) is not zero. In each iteration:
     - Right shift \( n \) by one bit (i.e., `n >>= 1`) and increment the distance counter \( d \).

3. **Check for `1`s**:
   - If the least significant bit of \( n \) (i.e., `n % 2`) is `1`:
     - Update `res` to be the maximum of its current value and \( d \) (the current distance).
     - Reset \( d \) to `0` for the next sequence of bits.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all bits, return `res`, which holds the maximum distance between consecutive `1`s.

### Code Walk-through
- The function efficiently finds the maximum distance by iterating through the bits of \( n \) and checking for the presence of `1`s.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1), since the number of bits in \( n \) (32 bits for a 32-bit integer) is constant.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space is used that grows with input size.
