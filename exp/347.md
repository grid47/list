### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. 

### Approach
1. **Count Frequencies**: Use a map (or unordered map) to count the frequency of each element in the array.
2. **Use a Priority Queue**: Create a max-heap (priority queue) to store elements by their frequencies. The heap will store pairs of the form `(frequency, element)`.
3. **Extract Top K Elements**: Pop the top `k` elements from the heap and store their corresponding keys (elements) in the result array.

### Code Walk-through
- The frequency of each number is counted using a map.
- Each entry in the map is then pushed into a priority queue, which organizes the pairs in descending order of frequency.
- Finally, the top `k` elements are extracted from the heap and added to the result vector.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Counting frequencies takes \( O(n) \) where \( n \) is the number of elements in `nums`.
  - Pushing all elements into the priority queue takes \( O(m \log m) \), where \( m \) is the number of unique elements.
  - Extracting the top `k` elements takes \( O(k \log m) \).
  - Overall, the complexity is \( O(n + m \log m) \).

- **Space Complexity**: \( O(m) \) for storing the frequency map and the priority queue.
