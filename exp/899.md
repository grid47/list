### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you are allowed to perform `k` operations where each operation consists of moving the first character of `s` to the end of `s`. Return the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing these operations.

### Approach
1. **Case when `k > 1`**:
   - If `k` is greater than 1, you can rearrange the string freely, so simply sort the string and return the result.

2. **Case when `k == 1`**:
   - If `k` is 1, perform the following:
     - Initialize `mn` with the original string `s`.
     - Generate all possible rotations of the string by concatenating substrings: `s.substr(i) + s.substr(0, i)`.
     - Update `mn` with the minimum string found among all rotations.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to generate the ordered queue.
    - `string orderlyQueue(string s, int k)`: Computes the lexicographically smallest string after performing the allowed operations.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - O(n log n) for sorting the string when `k > 1`.
  - O(n^2) for checking all rotations when `k == 1`, where n is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the sorted string or the minimum string during rotations.
