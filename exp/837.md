### Problem Statement
In a card game, you draw cards until your score exceeds a certain value. Given the parameters:
- `n`: the maximum score you can achieve.
- `k`: the threshold score where you stop drawing.
- `w`: the maximum value of a card drawn (1 to `w`).

The goal is to find the probability of achieving a score less than or equal to `n` after you stop drawing cards.

### Approach
1. **Special Cases**:
   - If `k == 0`, the probability is `1` because you don't need to draw any cards.
   - If `n >= k + w`, you can always achieve a score of at least `k`, so the probability is `1`.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
   - Use a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the probability of achieving exactly `i` points.
   - Initialize `dp[0] = 1` because the probability of starting with 0 points is 1.
   - Maintain a sliding window `Wsum` to sum the probabilities of the last `w` values.
   
3. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - For each score `i` from `1` to `n`:
     - Calculate the probability of achieving score `i` by averaging the probabilities of the previous `w` scores (i.e., from `i - 1` to `i - w`).
     - If `i < k`, add `dp[i]` to `Wsum` because you still need to draw cards.
     - If `i >= k`, add `dp[i]` to the result `res`.
     - Subtract the value `dp[i - w]` from `Wsum` if `i - w` is non-negative.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The result will be the sum of probabilities for scores `k` or more.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), as we iterate through scores from `1` to `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the storage required for the DP array.
