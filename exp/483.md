### Problem Statement

The task is to find the smallest base `k` (where `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2) in which the number `n` can be represented as `111...1` (i.e., a sequence of `1`s). This sequence of `1`s, when converted from base `k`, should equal the given number `n`. For example, if `n = 13`, the smallest base that allows `n` to be represented as `111` in base `k` is `3`, because \(3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0 = 13\).

### Approach

To find the smallest base efficiently, we need to determine the correct base `k` that can generate a sequence of `1`s adding up to `n`. This approach avoids brute-force checking every possible base by leveraging mathematical insights about the relationship between the number of `1`s and the base:

1. **Defining Parameters**: We start by converting `n` from a string to a numeric value (`num`) using `stol`. This allows us to perform mathematical operations on `n`.

2. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths (m)**: 
   - The length of the sequence of `1`s in base `k` that can represent `n` can vary. For example, for `n = 13`, `111` has length 3 in base 3.
   - We calculate the maximum possible length `m` of the sequence by using `log2(num)`, which gives us the highest possible value for `m` that would produce a number close to `num`.
   - By iterating from this maximum down to `2`, we progressively try shorter sequences.

3. **Calculate Possible Base (k)**: 
   - For each `m`, we attempt to find a possible base `k` by computing `k = pow(num, 1.0 / m)`.
   - This calculation gives us an approximate value of `k` that, when raised to the power of `m` in a sum, could represent `num`.

4. **Check If Base `k` Satisfies the Condition**: 
   - For each candidate `k`, we check if it produces the correct sum by simulating the sequence of `1`s. Starting with `sum = 1` (for the initial `1`), we iteratively add terms generated by powers of `k` until we have `m` terms.
   - If the sum of this sequence equals `num`, then `k` is a valid base.

5. **Return the Smallest Base or Fallback**: 
   - If we find a valid base `k` that satisfies the condition, we return it as a string.
   - If no valid base is found, we return `num - 1`, which corresponds to the base that produces `111...1` in binary form for any number, since every number `n` can be represented as `1`s in base `n-1`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

The code implements the outlined approach in a systematic way:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   const long num = stol(n);
   ```
   This converts the input string `n` to a long integer `num` to facilitate mathematical operations.

2. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths `m`**:
   ```cpp
   for (int m = log2(num); m >= 2; --m) {
   ```
   The outer loop iterates from the maximum possible sequence length `m` down to `2`. The maximum length `m` is determined by `log2(num)` since it represents the longest possible sequence for the given `num`.

3. **Calculate Possible Base `k`**:
   ```cpp
   const int k = pow(num, 1.0 / m);
   ```
   This calculates a candidate base `k` that could potentially represent `num` as a sequence of `1`s of length `m`.

4. **Compute the Sum of the Sequence in Base `k`**:
   ```cpp
   long sum = 1;
   long prod = 1;
   for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
       prod *= k;
       sum += prod;
   }
   ```
   - Here, `sum` is initialized to `1` (the initial term for `1` in the sequence), and `prod` is updated to store powers of `k`.
   - The inner loop iterates `m` times, each time multiplying `prod` by `k` and adding it to `sum`.

5. **Check Condition and Return Base**:
   ```cpp
   if (sum == num)
       return to_string(k);
   ```
   If the sum matches `num`, weâ€™ve found the correct base `k`, which is then returned as a string.

6. **Fallback Return**:
   ```cpp
   return to_string(num - 1);
   ```
   If no valid base is found, `num - 1` is returned. This is guaranteed to work since any integer `n` can be represented as `111...1` in base `n-1`.

### Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is approximately O(log2(n) * m), where `m` varies based on the value of `num` and depends on the potential length of the sequence. Each iteration involves a calculation for powers of `k` and summing terms. However, by iterating only over feasible values of `m` and calculating `k` directly, we reduce unnecessary operations.

The space complexity is O(1) as we only store a few constant variables (`sum`, `prod`, `num`, and `k`).

### Conclusion

This solution is optimized for performance, using mathematical properties to avoid brute-force computation of all possible bases. By leveraging logarithmic bounds on `m` and focusing on feasible candidates for `k`, it provides an efficient and reliable way to find the smallest good base for any given integer. This approach demonstrates how a problem involving base representation can be efficiently solved with strategic use of logarithmic and exponential functions, making it both a practical and educational algorithm for base conversion tasks.
