### Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `n` represented as a string, return the smallest good base of `n`. A good base `k` is defined such that `n` can be represented as the sum of a geometric series: \( n = k^0 + k^1 + k^2 + ... + k^{m} \) for some integer \( m \geq 1 \).

### Approach
1. **Convert Input**:
   - Convert the string `n` to a long integer `num`.

2. **Iterate Over Possible Base Sizes**:
   - Start with the maximum possible value for `m` (the length of the geometric series) which is determined by `log2(num)`.
   - For each value of `m`, calculate the potential base `k` using \( k = \text{floor}(num^{1/m}) \).

3. **Check if Sum Matches**:
   - Calculate the sum of the geometric series for the given base `k` and check if it equals `num`.
   - If a match is found, return the string representation of `k`.

4. **Default Return**:
   - If no valid base is found, return `num - 1` as the smallest base.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `smallestGoodBase()` takes a string `n` as input.

2. **Base Calculation**:
   - Loop through possible values of `m` starting from `log2(num)` down to `2`.
   - For each `m`, calculate the base `k` and then the sum of the series.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - If a valid base is found, return it; otherwise, return `num - 1`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) due to the logarithmic number of potential base sizes to check.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since only a few variables are used for calculations.
