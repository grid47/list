### Problem Statement
Given `N` different songs and a playlist of length `L`, calculate the number of possible playlists that can be created under the following constraints:
1. A song can be played only once in a `K`-song span.
2. The playlist must be exactly `L` songs long.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Use a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of valid playlists of length `i` that use exactly `j` different songs.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Set `dp[0][0] = 1` since there is one way to create a playlist of length 0 with 0 songs.

3. **DP Transition**:
   - For each length `i` from `1` to `L` and for each count of songs `j` from `1` to `N`:
     - Add a new song not yet in the playlist:
       \[
       dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1] \times (N - (j-1))
       \]
     - Reuse a song from the previous `K` songs:
       \[
       dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j] \times (j-K) \quad \text{if } j > K
       \]

4. **Result**:
   - The final answer is stored in `dp[L][N]`.

### Code Walk-through
- The outer loop iterates over the length of the playlist.
- The inner loop iterates over the number of unique songs used.
- Updates to the DP table are made based on whether a new song is added or an existing one is reused.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(L * N) since we fill a DP table of size `(L+1) x (N+1)`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(L * N) for the DP table.
