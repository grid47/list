### Problem Statement

This problem involves generating playlists with specific constraints. Given `N` unique songs, `L` as the total length of the playlist, and `K` as the minimum number of songs that must play before any song can be repeated, we need to count the number of valid playlists that can be created. Each song can appear at most once in any consecutive group of `K+1` songs. The solution should return the number of valid playlists modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Approach

To solve this problem, we use dynamic programming (DP). The key idea is to build up valid playlists of increasing lengths, accounting for unique songs and the repetition constraint as we progress. We define `dp[i][j]` as the number of ways to create a playlist of length `i` with `j` unique songs. Using this setup, we can build up the final answer by calculating possible combinations step-by-step.

1. **Define the DP State and Initialization**:
   - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of valid playlists of length `i` that contain exactly `j` unique songs.
   - We initialize `dp[0][0] = 1` because there is only one way to make an empty playlist with zero songs.

2. **Recurrence Relations**:
   - We have two cases to consider when filling in `dp[i][j]`:
     - **Adding a new unique song**: 
       - If we add a new song, we choose one of the `N - (j - 1)` remaining unique songs that haven't been added to the playlist yet. Therefore, `dp[i][j]` gets a contribution from `dp[i-1][j-1] * (N - (j-1))`.
     - **Reusing a song already in the playlist**:
       - If we reuse a song that has already appeared, we must select from the `j - K` songs already used in the playlist (as only these can be repeated due to the constraint `K`). Thus, `dp[i][j]` gets a contribution from `dp[i-1][j] * (j - K)`.

3. **Final Result**:
   - After filling out the table, `dp[L][N]` gives us the number of valid playlists of length `L` with exactly `N` unique songs.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Initialize Constants and DP Array**:
   ```cpp
   int mod = (int)pow(10, 9) + 7;
   vector<vector<long>> dp(L+1, vector<long>(N+1, 0));
   dp[0][0] = 1;
   ```
   - `mod` is set to \(10^9 + 7\) to avoid overflow and meet the modulus requirement.
   - `dp` is a 2D vector initialized to zeros, with dimensions `(L+1) x (N+1)`.

2. **Fill the DP Array Using Nested Loops**:
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 1; i <= L; i++){
       for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++){
           dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] * (N - (j-1))) % mod;
           if (j > K){
               dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + (dp[i-1][j] * (j-K)) % mod) % mod;
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   - **Outer Loop (`i`)**: Represents building playlists of increasing length, up to `L`.
   - **Inner Loop (`j`)**: Represents building playlists with an increasing count of unique songs, up to `N`.
   - **Adding a Unique Song**: 
     - For each `dp[i][j]`, we calculate the number of ways to add a new song by taking `dp[i-1][j-1] * (N - (j-1))`, and we store it modulo `mod`.
   - **Reusing a Song**:
     - If `j > K`, we add the count of ways to reuse one of the already played songs, which is `dp[i-1][j] * (j-K)`, also taken modulo `mod`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return (int)dp[L][N];
   ```
   - We return `dp[L][N]`, which represents the number of valid playlists of length `L` containing `N` unique songs.

### Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is **O(L * N)**, where `L` is the length of the playlist and `N` is the number of unique songs. Each `dp[i][j]` entry is calculated in constant time due to straightforward operations, resulting in a total of `L * N` operations.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is **O(L * N)** as well, due to the `dp` table which stores the number of ways for each playlist length and song count combination.

### Conclusion

This solution effectively uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid playlists under strict constraints on song repetition. By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, it achieves optimal performance within the required limits. The approach leverages modular arithmetic to manage large numbers, ensuring efficient calculations. This algorithm is ideal for scenarios requiring a high degree of constraint adherence in combinatorial playlists.
