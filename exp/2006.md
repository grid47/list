### Problem Statement

The task is to count the number of pairs of integers in a given list (`nums`) such that the absolute difference between the two integers in each pair equals a specified value `k`. This problem is a common one in algorithm challenges, often referred to as "counting pairs with a specific difference." For instance, if `nums = [1, 2, 2, 1]` and `k = 1`, the pairs that satisfy this condition are `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)`, which makes the total count 4.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can leverage the concept of counting frequencies. Instead of checking every possible pair (which would result in a time complexity of O(n²)), we can use a frequency array to count occurrences of each number in `nums`. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Frequency Counting**: Create an array (`cnt`) to count the occurrences of each integer from 0 to 100 (since the problem specifies that the integers in `nums` will range between 0 and 100).
   
2. **Counting Valid Pairs**: For each possible integer from `k + 1` to 100, we will find the number of occurrences of that integer and its corresponding pair integer (which would be `number - k`). The product of these counts will give us the total number of valid pairs for that specific integer.

3. **Summation**: Accumulate these products to get the final result, which represents the total number of pairs that have an absolute difference of `k`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Let's break down the code step by step to clarify how this approach is implemented:

1. **Class Definition**: The code is encapsulated within a class named `Solution`.

    ```cpp
    class Solution {
    public:
    ```

2. **Method Declaration**: The method `countKDifference` is declared to take a vector of integers (`nums`) and an integer `k` as parameters, returning the count of valid pairs.

    ```cpp
    int countKDifference(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    ```

3. **Frequency Array Initialization**: We initialize a frequency array `cnt` of size 101 (to cover integers 0 through 100) and a result variable `res` to hold the final count.

    ```cpp
    int cnt[101] = {}, res = 0;
    ```

4. **Counting Frequencies**: We loop through the `nums` vector, incrementing the corresponding index in the `cnt` array for each number found.

    ```cpp
    for (auto n : nums)
        ++cnt[n];
    ```

5. **Counting Valid Pairs**: We then iterate from `k + 1` to 100. For each integer `i` in this range, we compute the total valid pairs by multiplying the count of `i` (`cnt[i]`) with the count of its corresponding pair integer (`cnt[i - k]`).

    ```cpp
    for (int i = k + 1; i < 101; ++i)
        res += cnt[i] * cnt[i - k];
    ```

6. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we return the total count of pairs found.

    ```cpp
    return res;
    }
    ```

### Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n + m), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums` and `m` is a constant (101 in this case due to the range of numbers). The space complexity is O(m) for the frequency array, which is manageable since `m` is fixed. This efficient approach significantly reduces the computation time compared to a naive O(n²) solution, especially for larger arrays.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the provided code offers an efficient solution to the problem of counting pairs with a specific difference in a list of integers. By utilizing a frequency array, we effectively reduce the number of operations needed to find valid pairs, resulting in a time-efficient algorithm that can handle larger datasets gracefully. The implementation showcases a clear and logical approach to a common computational problem, making it not only efficient but also easy to understand. This method serves as an excellent example of how frequency counting can simplify complex pairing problems in algorithm design. Overall, the solution is robust, and its elegance lies in its simplicity and effectiveness in counting valid pairs efficiently.
