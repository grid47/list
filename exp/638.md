### Problem Statement
You are given the prices of different items and a list of special offers that can be applied when shopping for those items. Each offer consists of a set of items that can be bought together at a discounted price. The goal is to determine the minimum cost to satisfy a list of item needs using both direct purchases and special offers.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
   - Use a map (`mp`) to cache results for specific item needs to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The function `shoppingOffers` calculates the minimum cost to meet the specified needs.

2. **Calculating Cost**:
   - The function `calculate` computes the total cost of the current needs without any offers applied.

3. **Applying Special Offers**:
   - For each special offer:
     - Update the current needs by subtracting the items included in the offer.
     - Check if the updated needs are valid (i.e., non-negative).
     - Recursively call `shoppingOffers` to compute the cost if this offer is applied.
     - Restore the original needs after checking the offer.
   - Keep track of the minimum cost encountered.

4. **Return Result**:
   - The function returns the minimum cost found for the given needs.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Base Case**: If the current needs have been computed before, return the cached result.
2. **Calculate Cost**: Compute the direct purchase cost for the current needs.
3. **Iterate Offers**: For each special offer, modify the current needs and recursively calculate the potential cost.
4. **Update Cache**: Store the computed minimum cost for the current needs in the map.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^k), where N is the number of different items and k is the maximum number of items needed in any offer. This is because for each state, we may consider multiple offers.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the size of the needs vector, due to storage in the cache map.
