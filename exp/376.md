### Problem Statement

The problem at hand asks us to determine the length of the longest "wiggle subsequence" in an integer array. A "wiggle" sequence is a sequence where the differences between consecutive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The goal is to find the length of the longest subsequence of numbers from the given list that forms a wiggle sequence.

For example:
- In the sequence `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]`, the longest wiggle subsequence is `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` because the differences between consecutive elements alternate in sign (increases and decreases).
- In the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the longest wiggle subsequence is `[1, 2]` or `[1, 5]`, as there is no alternating pattern between all elements.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we use dynamic programming (DP) with two states to keep track of the maximum lengths of wiggle subsequences that end in an upward or downward movement.

#### Key Observations
- We can represent the problem using two arrays (or states):
  - `up[i]`: The length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending at index `i` where the last movement is an upward movement (i.e., `nums[i] > nums[i-1]`).
  - `down[i]`: The length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending at index `i` where the last movement is a downward movement (i.e., `nums[i] < nums[i-1]`).
  
- If we encounter an element that is greater than the previous one (`nums[i] > nums[i-1]`), we update `up[i]` to be `down[i-1] + 1`, indicating that the subsequence can continue with an upward movement. Meanwhile, `down[i]` remains the same as `down[i-1]` because the downward movement does not continue.
  
- If we encounter an element that is smaller than the previous one (`nums[i] < nums[i-1]`), we update `down[i]` to be `up[i-1] + 1`, indicating that the subsequence can continue with a downward movement. Meanwhile, `up[i]` remains the same as `up[i-1]`.

- If the current element is equal to the previous element (`nums[i] == nums[i-1]`), both `up[i]` and `down[i]` are updated to be the same as the previous values `up[i-1]` and `down[i-1]` respectively, as there is no movement in either direction.

- At the end of the loop, the result will be the maximum of `up[n-1]` and `down[n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the array.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Check for Empty Array

```cpp
if(nums.size() == 0) return 0;
```
- If the input array `nums` is empty, there are no elements to form a subsequence, so the function immediately returns `0`.

#### Step 2: Initialize the DP Arrays

```cpp
int n = nums.size();
vector<int> up(n, 0);
vector<int> down(n, 0);

up[0] = 1;
down[0] = 1;
```
- We define two vectors, `up` and `down`, both initialized to zeros. These vectors will hold the length of the longest wiggle subsequence that ends at each index with an upward or downward movement respectively.
- Both `up[0]` and `down[0]` are set to `1` because any single element is considered a valid subsequence of length 1, and it can start with either an upward or downward movement.

#### Step 3: Loop Through the Array

```cpp
for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if(nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
        down[i] = up[i - 1] + 1;
        up[i] = up[i - 1];
    }
    else if(nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
        up[i] = down[i - 1] + 1;
        down[i] = down[i - 1];
    }
    else {
        down[i] = down[i - 1];
        up[i] = up[i - 1];
    }
}
```
- The loop iterates over the array starting from the second element (`i = 1`).
- For each element `nums[i]`, we compare it with the previous element `nums[i-1]`:
  - If `nums[i]` is smaller than `nums[i-1]`, we update `down[i]` to be the longest subsequence with a downward movement (`up[i-1] + 1`), and the `up[i]` value remains the same as the previous value (`up[i-1]`).
  - If `nums[i]` is greater than `nums[i-1]`, we update `up[i]` to be the longest subsequence with an upward movement (`down[i-1] + 1`), and the `down[i]` value remains the same as the previous value (`down[i-1]`).
  - If `nums[i]` is equal to `nums[i-1]`, neither the `up[i]` nor the `down[i]` values change, as there is no wiggle in the sequence.

#### Step 4: Return the Maximum Wiggle Subsequence Length

```cpp
return max(down[n - 1], up[n - 1]);
```
- After the loop finishes, the longest wiggle subsequence can either end with an upward or downward movement. Therefore, the final result is the maximum of `up[n-1]` and `down[n-1]`, which represents the longest wiggle subsequence in the entire array.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we only need a single pass through the array to compute the values of `up` and `down` arrays.

#### Space Complexity

- The space complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is due to the storage of two vectors (`up` and `down`) of size `n`.

### Conclusion

The solution effectively solves the problem using dynamic programming, where the `up` and `down` arrays track the longest subsequences with alternating upward and downward movements. By iterating through the array once and updating the arrays in each step, we can efficiently compute the length of the longest wiggle subsequence in **O(n)** time with **O(n)** space complexity. This solution is optimal and scalable for large inputs, and it demonstrates a clear application of dynamic programming to handle alternating sequences.
