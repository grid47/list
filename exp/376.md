### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, your goal is to find the length of the longest wiggle subsequence. A sequence is called a wiggle sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use two arrays, `up` and `down`, to store the length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending with an upward and downward wiggle at each index, respectively.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Set `up[0]` and `down[0]` to 1, as the minimum length of a wiggle sequence that includes at least the first number is 1.

3. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - For each number from the second to the last:
     - If the current number is less than the previous one, it forms a downward wiggle, so update `down[i]` to `up[i - 1] + 1` and keep `up[i]` as `up[i - 1]`.
     - If the current number is greater than the previous one, it forms an upward wiggle, so update `up[i]` to `down[i - 1] + 1` and keep `down[i]` as `down[i - 1]`.
     - If the current number is equal to the previous one, both `up[i]` and `down[i]` should be equal to their previous values.

4. **Result**:
   - The result will be the maximum of the last elements of both `up` and `down` arrays, which gives the length of the longest wiggle subsequence.

### Code Walk-through
- The `wiggleMaxLength` function initializes the `up` and `down` arrays and iterates through the `nums` array to update the lengths based on the relationships between adjacent elements.
- Finally, it returns the maximum of the lengths stored in the `up` and `down` arrays.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \) where \( n \) is the length of the `nums` array, since we traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) for the `up` and `down` arrays to keep track of the lengths.
