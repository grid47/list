### Problem Statement
Design a class `KthLargest` that keeps track of the kth largest element in a stream of integers. The class should support the following operations:
- Constructor: Initializes the object with the integer k and an initial list of integers.
- `add(val)`: Adds a new integer to the stream and returns the current kth largest element.

### Approach
1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `k`: The position of the largest element to track.
   - `nums`: A vector of integers that initializes the stream.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a min-heap (priority queue) to store the k largest elements. This allows efficient retrieval of the kth largest element.

3. **Constructor**:
   - In the constructor, iterate through the initial list of integers (`nums`).
   - Push each number into the min-heap.
   - If the size of the heap exceeds k, remove the smallest element (the top of the heap).

4. **Add Method**:
   - The `add` method pushes the new value into the min-heap.
   - If the size of the heap exceeds k, pop the smallest element.
   - Return the top element of the heap, which represents the current kth largest element.

### Code Walk-through
- The constructor initializes the `KthLargest` object by populating the priority queue with the provided numbers.
- The `add` method maintains the size of the priority queue at k, ensuring that the kth largest element can always be accessed efficiently.
- The top of the priority queue is always the kth largest element, which is returned after each addition.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Constructor: O(N log k), where N is the number of elements in `nums`.
  - `add(val)`: O(log k) for each call due to the insertion and possible removal of the smallest element.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k) for storing the k largest elements in the priority queue.
