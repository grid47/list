### Problem Statement
Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:
1. **Insert** a key-value pair.
2. **Sum** the values of all keys that start with a given prefix.

### Approach
The solution utilizes a **Trie** (prefix tree) to store the keys and their associated values. The Trie allows efficient prefix lookups, making it suitable for the `sum` operation.

1. **TrieNode Structure**:
   - Each `TrieNode` contains:
     - A vector of pointers to its children (`next`) corresponding to the 26 lowercase letters.
     - An integer `sum` that keeps track of the cumulative value of all keys that pass through this node.
     - A string `s` to store the key.

2. **Adding Keys**:
   - The `add` function inserts a key into the Trie:
     - Traverse each character of the key, creating new nodes as necessary.
     - Update the cumulative sum at each node to include the value associated with the key.

3. **Calculating the Sum**:
   - The `val` function retrieves the cumulative sum for keys that match a given prefix:
     - Traverse the Trie following the characters in the prefix.
     - Return the sum stored at the last node reached.

4. **MapSum Class**:
   - Uses a TrieNode (`root`) to manage the Trie structure.
   - A map (`store`) is used to keep track of the values of keys to handle updates efficiently.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: When a `MapSum` object is created, a root `TrieNode` is instantiated.
2. **Insert Operation**: When inserting a key-value pair:
   - If the key already exists, adjust the value by subtracting the previous value from the new value.
   - Call the `add` method of the Trie to update the structure.
3. **Sum Operation**: The `sum` method retrieves the sum of values for all keys that start with a specified prefix by calling the `val` method of the Trie.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Insert: O(m), where m is the length of the key being inserted.
  - Sum: O(p), where p is the length of the prefix.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * m) in the worst case, where n is the number of keys and m is the average length of the keys, as we may store up to n keys in the Trie.
