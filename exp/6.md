### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic substring within it.

### Approach
Utilize a center-expansion technique to check for palindromes by expanding around potential centers. Each character (or pair of characters) serves as a possible center of a palindrome, and the expansion continues outward as long as the characters on both sides match.

### Code Walk-through
1. Initialize `lo` and `len` to track the starting index and length of the longest palindrome found.
2. Loop through each character in the string:
   - Call `pal` to check for odd-length palindromes (single character center).
   - Call `pal` to check for even-length palindromes (two-character center).
3. In the `pal` function:
   - Expand outwards as long as the characters at indices `i` and `j` match, while also checking bounds.
   - If a longer palindrome is found (i.e., `len < j - i - 1`), update `lo` and `len`.
4. After the loop, return the longest palindromic substring using `s.substr(lo, len)`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\) - as the expansion may need to check each substring.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) - no additional space is used aside from a few variables.
