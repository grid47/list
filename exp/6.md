### Problem Statement

The problem requires converting a given string `str` into a "zigzag" pattern on a given number of rows `n` and then reading the pattern row by row to generate the final string. The zigzag pattern is formed by writing the string in a zigzag fashion and then reading it horizontally from top to bottom.

#### Example:
For the string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` and `n = 3`, the zigzag pattern will be:

```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```

And the final result, when reading the rows left to right, will be: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`.

### Approach

This problem can be solved by simulating the creation of the zigzag pattern and then combining the rows into a single string.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Special Case for Single Row (`n == 1`)**: If there is only one row, the zigzag pattern will simply be the original string itself, as no "zigzag" can occur.

2. **Set Up Rows**: We will create a vector of strings where each string will represent one row of the zigzag pattern. Initially, all rows are empty.

3. **Simulate the Zigzag Movement**: Starting from the first character of the string:
   - Place the character in the current row.
   - Move down to the next row if we're moving downward, and move up if we're moving upward.
   - When the topmost or bottommost row is reached, the direction of movement switches.

4. **Form the Result String**: After processing all characters, the rows will be populated with the zigzag pattern. We concatenate the strings from each row to form the final result.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Handle Special Case for Single Row (`n == 1`)

```cpp
if(n == 1) return str;
```
- If the number of rows is `1`, the zigzag pattern is just the original string, so we immediately return the string without any modifications.

#### Step 2: Initialize Rows

```cpp
vector<string> s(n, "");
```
- We create a vector `s` of size `n`, where each element is an empty string. This will hold the individual rows of the zigzag pattern.

#### Step 3: Simulate the Zigzag Pattern

```cpp
bool down = true; 
int ridx = 1;
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    s[ridx - 1] += str[i];
    if (down) ridx++;
    else ridx--;
    if ((ridx == n) || (ridx == 1)) down = !down;
}
```
- `down` is a boolean variable that tracks whether we are moving down (true) or up (false) in the zigzag pattern.
- `ridx` is the row index, starting at `1` (because `ridx - 1` gives the actual index in the `s` vector).
- We loop through each character in the string, placing it in the correct row (`ridx - 1`).
- After placing the character:
  - If `down` is `true`, we increment `ridx` to move to the next row.
  - If `down` is `false`, we decrement `ridx` to move upward.
- When we reach the top row (`ridx == 1`) or the bottom row (`ridx == n`), we toggle the direction of movement (`down = !down`).

#### Step 4: Combine the Rows to Form the Final String

```cpp
string res = "";
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    res += s[i];
```
- After the loop finishes and all characters are placed in their respective rows, we concatenate the strings from all rows to form the final zigzag string.
  
#### Step 5: Return the Final String

```cpp
return res;
```
- We return the final concatenated string as the result of the conversion.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string. This is because we process each character of the string exactly once and perform constant time operations for each character.
- Specifically, we:
  - Loop through the string once to fill the rows (O(n)).
  - Concatenate all rows into the result string, which in the worst case takes O(n) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, which is optimal for this problem.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(n)** because we use a vector of strings to store the rows of the zigzag pattern. The total number of characters stored across all rows is equal to the length of the input string, resulting in a total space usage of O(n).

### Conclusion

The solution efficiently converts the input string into the desired zigzag pattern and then reads it row by row to generate the final result. The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time and uses **O(n)** additional space, making it optimal for large strings. The approach is both simple and effective, leveraging basic string operations and careful management of the direction of movement to simulate the zigzag pattern.
