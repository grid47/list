### Problem Statement
Given a binary matrix `grid` of size `m x n`, you can perform the following operations to maximize the score of the matrix:
1. Flip any row.
2. Flip any column.
The score of the matrix is calculated as the sum of the integers represented by each row, considering each row as a binary number.

### Approach
1. **Initial Score Calculation**: 
   - Start with the assumption that the first column can only be `1` to maximize the score. Therefore, the initial contribution to the score from the first column is `(1 << (n - 1)) * m`, where `m` is the number of rows. The `(1 << (n - 1))` calculates the value of the most significant bit for `n` columns.

2. **Column Optimization**:
   - For each column from the second to the last (index 1 to n-1), count how many rows have `1` and how many have `0` in that column.
   - The optimal strategy for each column is to choose the majority: if more rows have `1`, keep it as `1`; if more rows have `0`, flip it to `1`. This ensures that each column contributes maximally to the score.
   - Calculate the contribution of each column to the score based on whether we keep or flip the values.

3. **Score Update**:
   - The contribution for each column is multiplied by `(1 << (n - j - 1))`, where `j` is the index of the column being evaluated, effectively adjusting for its binary weight.

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - Return the total score after evaluating all columns.

### Code Walk-through
- Loop through each column (starting from the second) and calculate contributions to the score based on the number of `1s` and `0s`.
- Use bit manipulation to compute binary values efficiently.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns, as we iterate through each element of the matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space for calculations.
