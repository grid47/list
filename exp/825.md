### Problem Statement
The task is to calculate the number of friend requests that can be sent based on the ages of individuals, adhering to specific rules about age compatibility.

### Approach
1. **Count Ages**: Utilize a hash map to count the occurrences of each age in the input list.
2. **Evaluate Requests**: For each unique pair of ages, determine if a friend request can be sent using the `request` function, which checks the following conditions:
   - The recipient's age must not be less than half the sender's age plus 7.
   - The recipient's age must be less than or equal to the sender's age.
   - If either person's age is greater than 100, the other must also be 100 or younger.
3. **Calculate Total Requests**: For each valid age pair, calculate the total requests based on the counts stored in the map, ensuring to adjust for self-requests.

### Code Walk-through
- The `numFriendRequests` function first populates a map with age counts.
- It then iterates through all pairs of ages and checks the friend request conditions using the `request` function.
- The result is updated based on the counts of the valid pairs and returned.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2), where N is the number of unique ages since it evaluates requests for each unique pair.
- **Space Complexity**: O(U), where U is the number of unique ages stored in the hash map.
