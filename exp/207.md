### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n`, the number of courses, and a list of prerequisite pairs `pre`. Each pair `[a, b]` indicates that to take course `a`, you must first take course `b`. Return `true` if it is possible to finish all courses, otherwise return `false`.

### Approach
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Create a directed graph using an adjacency list where each course points to the courses that depend on it.
   - Maintain a count of incoming edges (`cnt`) for each course to track prerequisites.

2. **Building the Graph**:
   - Iterate over the `pre` list to populate the graph and update the dependency counts for each course.

3. **Queue for Courses without Dependencies**:
   - Use a queue to process courses that have no prerequisites (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`).

4. **Process Courses**:
   - While the queue is not empty:
     - For each course, decrement the dependency count of its dependent courses.
     - If a dependent course now has no prerequisites, add it to the queue.

5. **Check Completion**:
   - After processing, check if all courses have been taken (i.e., if all counts in `cnt` are zero).
   - Return `true` if all courses can be taken; otherwise, return `false`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Line 1**: Define the class `Solution`.
- **Line 2**: Define the function `canFinish(int n, vector<vector<int>>& pre)`.
- **Lines 3-4**: Initialize the graph and dependency counter.
- **Lines 6-10**: Build the graph and count prerequisites from the `pre` list.
- **Line 12**: Initialize a queue to process courses without prerequisites.
- **Lines 14-30**: Process the queue, decrementing counts and adding new courses to the queue as they become available.
- **Lines 32-34**: Check if all courses can be completed by verifying the counts.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n + p)\), where \(n\) is the number of courses and \(p\) is the number of prerequisite pairs, as each course and prerequisite is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n + p)\), due to the graph representation and the queue used for processing.
