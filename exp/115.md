### Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t`, count the number of distinct subsequences of `s` that equals `t`.

### Approach
1. Use dynamic programming with memoization to optimize the counting of distinct subsequences.
2. Define a recursive function `dp(i, j)`:
   - `i` is the current index in string `s`.
   - `j` is the current index in string `t`.
3. Base cases:
   - If `j` equals the length of `t`, return 1 (a valid subsequence is found).
   - If `i` equals the length of `s`, return 0 (no more characters to process).
4. If the value has already been computed (`memo[i][j]`), return it to avoid redundant calculations.
5. If characters `s[i]` and `t[j]` match:
   - Include the character: Count subsequences by advancing both indices.
   - Exclude the character: Count subsequences by advancing only the index of `s`.
6. If characters do not match, only advance the index of `s`.
7. Store the computed value in `memo` and return it.

### Code Walk-through
- **`numDistinct` function**:
  - **Line 21**: Initialize `s` and `t`.
  - **Line 22**: Use `memset` to initialize the memoization table.
  - **Line 23**: Call the recursive `dp` function starting from the beginning of both strings.

- **`dp` function**:
  - **Line 4**: Check if `j` equals the length of `t`. If true, return 1.
  - **Line 5**: Check if `i` equals the length of `s`. If true, return 0.
  - **Line 6**: Return the stored result if already computed.
  - **Lines 8-14**: Handle matching characters and recursive calls as described.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N \times M)\), where \(N\) is the length of `s` and \(M\) is the length of `t`, as each state is computed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N \times M)\) for the memoization table.
