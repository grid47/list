### 🚀 Problem Statement

The task is to find the **minimum number of patches** required to make all integers from 1 to `n` possible sums of some elements from a given sorted array `nums`. A patch is a number that can be added to the array, and the goal is to determine the smallest number of patches needed to cover all the integers in the range from 1 to `n`.

#### Input:
- `nums`: A sorted array of positive integers.
- `n`: A positive integer representing the upper limit of the range (from 1 to `n`).

#### Output:
- The minimum number of patches required to cover all integers from 1 to `n`.

### 🧠 Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we will use a **greedy algorithm**. The central idea is to keep track of a variable `miss`, which represents the smallest integer we cannot yet form. Initially, `miss` is 1 because we want to start forming sums from 1.

#### The greedy strategy involves:
1. **Greedy Selection**: At each step, if the current number `nums[i]` can be used to form the current `miss`, we add it to `miss`. If not, we "patch" by adding `miss` itself as a new number, and then continue to the next step.
   
2. **Stopping Condition**: The process stops when `miss` exceeds `n`, as this means all integers from 1 to `n` are now covered.

### 🔨 Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

Let’s dive into the code and break it down:

```cpp
long miss = 1;
int added = 0, i = 0;
```
- **Initialization**:
  - `miss`: Represents the smallest integer that we cannot yet form. We start with `miss = 1`.
  - `added`: Counts the number of patches we've added.
  - `i`: Used to iterate through the `nums` array.

```cpp
while(miss <= n) {
    if(i < nums.size() && nums[i] <= miss) {
        miss += nums[i++];
    } else {
        miss += miss;
        added++;
    }
}
```
- **Main Loop**:
  - This loop runs until `miss > n`. Once `miss` exceeds `n`, we can form all numbers from 1 to `n`.
  - **Greedy Choice**: If the current number `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `miss`, we add it to `miss` and move to the next number (`i++`).
  - **Adding Patches**: If `nums[i]` is greater than `miss`, we add a patch equal to `miss`. This doubles `miss`, effectively covering the smallest missing integer. We also increment the `added` counter.

```cpp
return added;
```
- **Return the Result**:
  - After the loop terminates (when `miss > n`), we return `added`, which is the minimum number of patches needed.

### 📈 Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The algorithm iterates over the array `nums` and each patch doubles `miss`, so in the worst case, the loop runs in linear time relative to `n`. The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the upper limit of the range.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant because we only use a few variables (`miss`, `added`, `i`) to track the progress of the algorithm, and no additional data structures are needed.

### 🏁 Conclusion

This greedy approach efficiently calculates the minimum number of patches required to cover the range from 1 to `n`. At each step, we either use a number from `nums` or add a patch to cover the smallest missing integer. The solution is optimal, with a time complexity of **O(n)** and space complexity of **O(1)**.

By understanding the concept of "missing" integers and using patches strategically, we can quickly find the solution without unnecessary computations. This approach ensures that even for large values of `n`, we get the result efficiently!

### 🎯 Key Takeaways:
- **Greedy Algorithm**: The key is to cover the smallest missing integer (`miss`) either by using an existing number or by adding a patch.
- **Optimal Solution**: The algorithm works in **O(n)** time, making it efficient for large input sizes.
