### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find the **minimum number of patches** needed to make all integers from 1 to `n` possible sums of some elements from a given sorted array `nums`. The patches are numbers that can be added to the array, and the goal is to determine the fewest patches needed to cover all the integers from 1 to `n`.

#### Input:
- `nums`: A sorted array of positive integers.
- `n`: A positive integer representing the upper limit of the range of numbers (from 1 to `n`).

#### Output:
- The minimum number of patches needed to cover all integers from 1 to `n`.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we use a greedy algorithm. The key observation is that we need to maintain a variable `miss` which represents the smallest integer we cannot yet form with the numbers we've encountered. Initially, this is `1` because we want to start forming sums from 1.

The idea is to greedily select the smallest number in the array that is less than or equal to `miss`. If we can use this number to cover `miss`, we update `miss` by adding this number to it. If we cannot use the current number in `nums` to cover `miss`, we add a patch equal to `miss` and update `miss` to the next value it can potentially form. This continues until `miss` exceeds `n`.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Greedy Selection**: At each step, if the current number `nums[i]` can be used to form the current `miss`, we add it to `miss`. If not, we "patch" by adding `miss` itself as a new number, and then continue to the next step.
   
2. **Stopping Condition**: We stop when `miss` exceeds `n`, because at that point, all integers from 1 to `n` can be formed using the numbers in `nums` and the added patches.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Letâ€™s break down the code into understandable sections:

```cpp
long miss = 1;
int added = 0, i = 0;
```
- **Initialization**:
  - `miss`: This variable represents the smallest integer that we cannot yet form. Initially, it is set to `1` because we start by trying to form the number 1.
  - `added`: This counts the number of patches we have added to the array.
  - `i`: This is the index variable used to iterate over the `nums` array.

```cpp
while(miss <= n) {
    if(i < nums.size() && nums[i] <= miss) {
        miss += nums[i++];
    } else {
        miss += miss;
        added++;
    }
}
```
- **Main Loop**:
  - This loop runs as long as `miss <= n`. Once `miss` exceeds `n`, we stop since all numbers from 1 to `n` can be represented.
  - **Greedy Choice**: If the current number `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `miss`, we add it to `miss` and move to the next number in the `nums` array (`i++`).
  - **Adding Patches**: If `nums[i]` cannot be used to cover `miss` (i.e., `nums[i] > miss`), we add a patch with value `miss`. This effectively doubles `miss` since we just added the smallest missing number. We then increment the `added` counter to keep track of the number of patches we've added.

```cpp
return added;
```
- **Return the Result**:
  - After the loop terminates (when `miss > n`), we return `added`, which represents the minimum number of patches required to cover all integers from 1 to `n`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The algorithm iterates over the array `nums` once, and the number of patches added is proportional to the logarithm of `n`. In the worst case, the loop runs in linear time relative to `n`, since each patch potentially doubles `miss`. Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the upper limit of the range of numbers we need to cover.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant because we only use a few extra variables (`miss`, `added`, `i`) for the calculation, and no additional data structures are used other than the input array `nums`.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently calculates the minimum number of patches needed to cover the range from 1 to `n` using a greedy approach. The algorithm ensures that at each step, the smallest missing integer is either covered by an existing number in the array or a new patch is added. This results in an optimal solution that runs in **O(n)** time complexity with **O(1)** space complexity.

The approach is simple yet effective, and its greedy nature ensures that it performs well even for large values of `n`. The key insight behind this solution is understanding how to manage the smallest missing integer (`miss`) and how patches can quickly fill the gap when numbers in the array are insufficient to cover all numbers from 1 to `n`.
