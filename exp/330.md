### Problem Statement
You are given a sorted array `nums` of positive integers and an integer `n`. Your goal is to find the minimum number of patches (additional integers) needed so that you can form every integer from `1` to `n` using the elements of `nums` and the patches.

### Approach
The approach involves maintaining a variable `miss` which represents the smallest integer that cannot be formed using the existing numbers in the array and the patches added so far. The steps are as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with `miss = 1`, which indicates the smallest number that cannot currently be formed.
   - Set `added` to count the number of patches added, and `i` to track the index of the current element in `nums`.

2. **While Loop**:
   - Continue looping while `miss` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - If the current number `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `miss`, it means that we can use this number to form new sums, so we add it to `miss`.
   - If the current number cannot be used (i.e., `nums[i] > miss`), we need to add a patch. Doubling `miss` allows us to cover all integers up to the newly formed `miss`. Increment the `added` counter.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Once the loop completes, return the total number of patches added.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A vector of integers `nums` and an integer `n`.
- **Output**: An integer representing the minimum number of patches required.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of elements in `nums` since each element is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) as we are using a constant amount of space.
