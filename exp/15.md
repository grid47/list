### Problem Statement
Find all unique triplets in an array that sum up to zero. The solution must not use the same elements in different combinations.

### Approach
Utilize sorting and the two-pointer technique to efficiently find triplets that sum to zero.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a vector `ans` to store the resulting triplets.
   - Sort the input vector `nums` to facilitate the two-pointer technique.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - Iterate through each element `nums[i]` in the sorted array:
     - Set `target` to the negative value of the current element (`-nums[i]`).
     - Initialize two pointers: `s` (start) at `i + 1` and `e` (end) at the last index of `nums`.

3. **Inner While Loop**:
   - Continue as long as `s` is less than `e`:
     - Calculate the sum of the elements at the two pointers:
       - If the sum is less than `target`, increment `s` to increase the sum.
       - If the sum is greater than `target`, decrement `e` to decrease the sum.
       - If the sum equals `target`, add the triplet `{nums[i], nums[s], nums[e]}` to `ans`.
         - Move both pointers inward to avoid duplicates:
           - Increment `s` while the next number is the same as `nums[s]`.
           - Decrement `e` while the next number is the same as `nums[e]`.

4. **Avoid Duplicates**:
   - After processing `nums[i]`, skip all duplicate values by checking if `nums[i]` is the same as the next number.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, return the vector `ans` containing all unique triplets that sum to zero.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\) - where \(n\) is the length of the input array, due to the sorting step and the nested loop.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) - since the space used for the output is counted separately; the algorithm uses constant space for pointers and indices.
