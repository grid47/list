### Problem Statement
You are given two strings, `S` and `T`, that may contain the '#' character which represents a backspace. Your task is to determine whether the two strings are equal after all backspaces have been applied.

### Approach
1. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Use two pointers, `i` and `j`, to traverse the strings `S` and `T` from the end to the beginning.
   - Keep track of the number of backspaces encountered using a variable `back`.

2. **Backspace Processing**:
   - For each string, while the pointer is within bounds and the number of backspaces (`back`) is greater than zero or the current character is a backspace ('#'):
     - If the character is '#', increment `back` (indicating a backspace).
     - If the character is not '#', decrement `back` (indicating a valid character).
     - Move the pointer leftward.
     
3. **Character Comparison**:
   - After processing backspaces for both strings, compare the characters at the pointers:
     - If both pointers are valid and the characters at the pointers are equal, move both pointers leftward.
     - If they are not equal or one of the pointers is invalid while the other is not, break the loop.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, both pointers should be at -1 if the strings are equal after all backspaces.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of strings `S` and `T`, respectively. Each character is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional data structures are used beyond a few variables.
