### Problem Statement
You are given a grid representing the height of water in each cell. You start at the top-left cell (0,0) and need to reach the bottom-right cell (m-1,n-1) while swimming in water. Your goal is to minimize the maximum height of the water you have to swim through to reach the destination.

### Approach
1. **Priority Queue**:
   - Use a min-heap (priority queue) to explore cells based on the water level. This helps to always expand the least challenging cell first.
   - Store the cell coordinates and its height in the queue.

2. **Visited Tracking**:
   - Maintain a 2D vector `vis` to track visited cells and prevent cycles.

3. **Directions**:
   - Define the possible moves in the grid using an array of direction offsets.

4. **Processing Cells**:
   - Pop the cell with the minimum height from the queue and mark it as visited.
   - Update the maximum height (`mx`) encountered so far.
   - If the current cell is the bottom-right corner, return `mx` as the result.
   - Otherwise, push the valid neighboring cells (not visited and within bounds) into the priority queue.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `cmp`: Custom comparator for the priority queue to order cells by their height in ascending order.

- **Method**:
  - `int swimInWater(vector<vector<int>>& grid)`: Implements the logic to find the minimum maximum height of water while swimming from the top-left to the bottom-right cell.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(E log V), where E is the number of edges (possible cell movements) and V is the number of vertices (cells in the grid).
- **Space Complexity**: O(V), for storing the visited cells and the priority queue.
