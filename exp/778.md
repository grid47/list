### Problem Statement

In this problem, you're given a 2D grid `grid` of size `m x n`, where each cell in the grid contains a non-negative integer representing the height of that cell. The task is to swim from the top-left corner (0, 0) of the grid to the bottom-right corner (m-1, n-1) by moving to adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right). You can only swim in water where the current height is at most the maximum height you've already crossed. The goal is to determine the minimum time required to swim from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, where time is defined as the maximum height of water you've encountered on your path.

This problem can be viewed as finding the path where the largest height encountered is minimized, which essentially means performing a minimum time search while considering the terrain heights.

### Approach

The optimal way to solve this problem is to simulate a traversal from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid. The key challenge is to minimize the maximum height encountered during the traversal, which is similar to finding the "least maximum" value while traversing. This problem can be effectively approached using a **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)** with the help of a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** traversal strategy.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Use a Priority Queue (Min-Heap):**
   A priority queue helps prioritize visiting cells based on their heights. By always expanding the cell with the lowest height, we ensure that the maximum height encountered on the path is minimized.
   
2. **Track Visited Cells:**
   As we explore the grid, we need to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them and to prevent cycles in the traversal.

3. **Explore All Directions:**
   From any given cell, we will attempt to move to its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). If moving to a cell leads to a lower or equal height, it's a valid move. We continue the process until we reach the bottom-right corner.

4. **Return the Result:**
   Once we reach the bottom-right corner, the highest value encountered during the traversal will be our answer. This represents the minimum time required to swim from the start to the destination.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

```cpp
int m = grid.size();
int n = grid[0].size();
priority_queue<vector<int>, vector<vector<int>>, cmp> pq;
int mx = 0;
pq.push({0, 0, grid[0][0]});
vector<vector<bool>> vis(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
int dir[] = {0, 1, 0, -1, 0};
```

- **`m` and `n`** store the number of rows and columns of the grid.
- **`pq`** is a priority queue that holds the grid coordinates (x, y) and their corresponding heights, sorted in increasing order by height.
- **`mx`** keeps track of the maximum height encountered on the path.
- **`vis`** is a 2D boolean array that tracks whether a cell has already been visited.
- **`dir[]`** is an array that defines the possible directions for movement: right (0,1), left (0,-1), down (1,0), and up (-1,0).

#### Step 2: Start with the Top-Left Cell

```cpp
pq.push({0, 0, grid[0][0]});
```

- We push the starting point (0, 0) into the priority queue, with its height as the third element in the tuple.

#### Step 3: Traverse the Grid Using a Priority Queue

```cpp
while (!pq.empty()) {
    auto it = pq.top();
    pq.pop();
    vis[it[0]][it[1]] = true;
    mx = max(mx, grid[it[0]][it[1]]);
```

- The while loop continues until all reachable cells have been visited.
- We pop the cell with the lowest height from the priority queue (`it` stores the current cell's coordinates and height).
- **`vis[it[0]][it[1]] = true;`** marks the current cell as visited.
- **`mx = max(mx, grid[it[0]][it[1]]);`** updates the maximum height encountered so far.

#### Step 4: Check if We've Reached the Bottom-Right Corner

```cpp
if (it[0] == m - 1 && it[1] == n - 1)
    return mx;
```

- If we reach the bottom-right corner (m-1, n-1), we return the value of `mx` as the answer. This represents the maximum height encountered along the path from the top-left to the bottom-right.

#### Step 5: Add Adjacent Cells to the Priority Queue

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    int x = it[0] + dir[i], y = it[1] + dir[i + 1];
    if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= m || y >= n || vis[x][y])
        continue;
    pq.push({x, y, grid[x][y]});
}
```

- We explore the four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
- For each direction, we calculate the new cell's coordinates `(x, y)`.
- If the new coordinates are valid (within bounds and not already visited), we push the cell into the priority queue along with its height.

#### Step 6: Return -1 if No Path Exists

```cpp
return -1;
```

- If no valid path is found, we return `-1` as a fallback. This case should theoretically not occur in this problem, as there is always a path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

- **O(m * n log(m * n))**: The main time-consuming operation is pushing and popping cells from the priority queue. Each cell is pushed and popped at most once, and the priority queue operations (push and pop) have a time complexity of O(log(m * n)) due to the heap structure. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(m * n log(m * n)), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.

#### Space Complexity:

- **O(m * n)**: The space complexity is primarily due to the priority queue and the visited matrix. The priority queue can hold up to `m * n` elements, and the visited matrix also requires O(m * n) space.

### Conclusion

This solution provides an efficient way to solve the "Swim in Water" problem using a priority queue. The key to minimizing the maximum height encountered on the path is to always expand the cell with the smallest height, ensuring that we traverse the grid optimally. The use of BFS with a priority queue allows us to efficiently explore the grid, keeping track of the highest point we've encountered on our way from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. The time and space complexities are manageable, making this approach suitable for large grids.
