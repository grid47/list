### Problem Statement
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of the merged intervals.

### Approach
1. **Sort Intervals**:
   - First, sort the intervals based on their starting times. This ensures that if any intervals overlap, they will be adjacent to each other in the sorted order.

2. **Merge Overlapping Intervals**:
   - Initialize a temporary vector `tmp` with the first interval.
   - Iterate through the sorted intervals:
     - If the current interval overlaps with `tmp` (i.e., the start of the current interval is less than or equal to the end of `tmp`), update the end of `tmp` to the maximum of the two ends.
     - If there is no overlap, push `tmp` into the answer vector and update `tmp` to the current interval.

3. **Add the Last Interval**:
   - After the loop, push the last `tmp` into the answer vector to ensure it is included.

### Code Walk-through
- **Initialization**:
   - Start by sorting the input intervals.
- **Merging Logic**:
   - Loop through the sorted intervals and merge as necessary.
   - The merged intervals are stored in `ans`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n \log n) \) due to sorting, where \( n \) is the number of intervals.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) in the worst case to store the merged intervals.
