### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find all elements in a given list `nums` that appear more than `n/3` times, where `n` is the size of the list. We need to return these majority elements in a vector. If there are multiple such elements, all of them should be included in the result.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can leverage the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**. This algorithm is typically used to find the majority element in an array, and it can be extended to find elements that appear more than `n/3` times. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Two Potential Majority Candidates:**
   - Given that there can be at most two elements that appear more than `n/3` times in the array, we maintain two candidate values `cnd1` and `cnd2` and their respective counts `cnt1` and `cnt2`.

2. **First Pass: Identify Candidates:**
   - In the first pass through the array, we identify potential candidates for the majority elements by adjusting the counts. If a number matches one of the candidates, we increment its count. If the count for a candidate reaches zero, we replace that candidate with the current number.

3. **Second Pass: Verify Candidates:**
   - After identifying two potential candidates, we make a second pass through the array to count the occurrences of each candidate. If a candidate appears more than `n/3` times, it is a valid majority element.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the array is empty, we return an empty result immediately.
   - If no elements appear more than `n/3` times, the result will contain no elements.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialization

```cpp
std::vector<int> result;
int n = nums.size();
if (n == 0) return result;
```

- We initialize a vector `result` to store the majority elements.
- The variable `n` stores the size of the input list `nums`.
- If the list is empty (`n == 0`), we immediately return an empty result.

#### Step 2: Variables for Counting

```cpp
int cnt1 = 0, cnt2 = 0;
int cnd1 = 0, cnd2 = 0;
```

- We declare two counters `cnt1` and `cnt2` for the counts of two potential majority candidates, `cnd1` and `cnd2`.

#### Step 3: First Pass - Identify the Potential Candidates

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int val = nums[i];

    if (val == cnd1) cnt1++;
    else if (val == cnd2) cnt2++;
    else if (cnt1 == 0) { cnt1 = 1; cnd1 = val; }
    else if (cnt2 == 0) { cnt2 = 1; cnd2 = val; }
    else { cnt1--; cnt2--; }
}
```

- We iterate over the array and for each number `val`:
  - If `val` matches the first candidate (`cnd1`), we increment `cnt1`.
  - If `val` matches the second candidate (`cnd2`), we increment `cnt2`.
  - If `cnt1` is zero, we replace `cnd1` with `val` and reset `cnt1` to 1.
  - Similarly, if `cnt2` is zero, we replace `cnd2` with `val` and reset `cnt2` to 1.
  - If `val` doesn't match either candidate, we decrement both `cnt1` and `cnt2`.

This ensures that at the end of the loop, `cnd1` and `cnd2` are the two candidates that might have counts greater than `n/3`.

#### Step 4: Second Pass - Verify the Candidates

```cpp
cnt1 = 0;
cnt2 = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int val = nums[i];
    if (val == cnd1) cnt1++;
    else if (val == cnd2) cnt2++;
}
```

- In the second pass, we reset `cnt1` and `cnt2` to zero, and we count the actual occurrences of `cnd1` and `cnd2` in the array.

#### Step 5: Check for Majority Elements

```cpp
n = n / 3;

if (cnt1 > n) result.push_back(cnd1);
if (cnt2 > n) result.push_back(cnd2);
```

- We check if the counts of `cnd1` and `cnd2` are greater than `n/3`. If they are, we add them to the result vector.

#### Step 6: Return the Result

```cpp
return result;
```

- Finally, we return the `result` vector containing all elements that appear more than `n/3` times.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

- **First Pass:** The first loop iterates over all `n` elements, processing each element in constant time. Thus, the time complexity for the first pass is `O(n)`.
- **Second Pass:** The second loop also iterates over all `n` elements, counting occurrences of the candidates, so its time complexity is also `O(n)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Space Complexity:

- The space complexity is determined by the space used for storing the candidates (`cnd1`, `cnd2`) and their counts (`cnt1`, `cnt2`), which takes constant space `O(1)`.
- The result vector will store at most two elements (since there can be at most two majority elements), so its space complexity is `O(1)`.

Thus, the overall space complexity is `O(1)`.

### Conclusion

This solution is highly efficient and optimally solves the problem in linear time (`O(n)`) and constant space (`O(1)`). The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm is well-suited for this problem, as it effectively identifies potential majority elements and then verifies their counts in a second pass. This approach ensures that the solution is scalable and performs well even for large arrays.

#### Key Points:
- The algorithm identifies up to two potential majority candidates.
- The first pass selects the candidates, and the second pass counts their occurrences.
- The solution runs in linear time (`O(n)`) and uses constant space (`O(1)`), making it optimal for large inputs.
- The edge case of an empty array is handled at the start, ensuring robustness.

This method efficiently finds all elements that appear more than `n/3` times in an input list, making it ideal for problems of this type.
