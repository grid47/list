### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return all elements that appear more than ⌊n/3⌋ times. The algorithm should work in linear time with constant space complexity.

### Approach
- **Candidate Selection**: Use a modified version of the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to find up to two potential majority candidates. 
  - Maintain two counters (`cnt1`, `cnt2`) for two candidates (`cnd1`, `cnd2`).
  - Iterate through the array and update the counters based on the candidates' current values.
- **Count Validation**: After identifying candidates, iterate through the array again to count their occurrences and verify if they appear more than ⌊n/3⌋ times.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function `majorityElement(vector<int>& nums)`**:
  - Initialize the result vector `result`, and the size variable `n`.
  - Check if `n` is zero; if so, return an empty result.
  - Use a first loop to identify potential candidates:
    - For each value in `nums`, update the counters based on the current candidates.
  - Use a second loop to count the occurrences of the candidates.
  - Compare the counts to n/3; if any candidate count exceeds this threshold, add the candidate to the result.
  
### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`, since the array is traversed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as the space used does not scale with input size, only using a fixed amount of space for counters and candidate storage.
