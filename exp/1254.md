### Problem Statement
The objective of the problem is to determine the number of closed islands in a given 2D binary grid. In this grid, `0`s represent water and `1`s represent land. A closed island is defined as an island that is entirely surrounded by water (i.e., `0`s) and does not touch the grid's borders. Your task is to count the total number of closed islands in the grid.

### Approach
To solve this problem, we will use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The main steps of the solution are as follows:

1. **Identify and Fill Border Islands**: First, traverse the border of the grid. For any `0` found on the border, perform a DFS to mark all connected `0`s. This effectively removes all open islands connected to the borders.

2. **Count Closed Islands**: After marking border-connected islands, iterate through the grid again. For each unvisited `0`, perform a DFS to mark it and its connected `0`s, incrementing the closed island count.

3. **DFS Implementation**: The DFS function will be responsible for traversing the grid recursively, marking visited cells to avoid counting them again.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int closedIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
```
- **Line 1-2**: The class `Solution` is defined, containing the public method `closedIsland`, which takes a 2D vector of integers (`grid`) and returns the number of closed islands as an integer.

```cpp
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
```
- **Line 3**: Variables `m` and `n` are initialized to represent the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
        for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            if(i == 0 || j == 0 || i == m - 1 || j == n - 1)
                if(grid[i][j] == 0)
                    dfs(grid, i, j, 0, 1);
```
- **Line 4-10**: This nested loop iterates through every cell in the grid. If a cell is on the border (first or last row/column) and is water (`0`), the DFS function is called to mark all connected water cells, preventing them from being counted as closed islands later.

```cpp
        int cnt = 0;
```
- **Line 11**: A counter `cnt` is initialized to keep track of the number of closed islands found.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
        for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            if(grid[i][j] == 0) {
                dfs(grid, i, j, 0, cnt + 2);
                cnt++;
            }
```
- **Line 12-18**: A second nested loop traverses the grid again. For each unvisited water cell (`0`), the DFS function is invoked to mark the closed island, and the counter `cnt` is incremented.

```cpp
        return cnt;
    }
```
- **Line 19-20**: Finally, the function returns the total count of closed islands.

```cpp
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int i, int j, int cur, int tgt) {
```
- **Line 21**: The `dfs` function is defined. It takes the grid, current cell indices (`i`, `j`), the current value to match (`cur`), and the target value to mark visited cells (`tgt`).

```cpp
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        if(i < 0 || j < 0 || i == m || j == n || grid[i][j] != cur)
            return;
```
- **Line 22-25**: Within the DFS function, the dimensions of the grid are fetched. The first condition checks if the current indices are out of bounds or if the current cell does not match the `cur` value. If any condition is met, the function returns, effectively stopping the recursion.

```cpp
        grid[i][j] = tgt;
```
- **Line 26**: If the cell is valid, it is marked as visited by assigning it the `tgt` value.

```cpp
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j, cur, tgt);
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1, cur, tgt);
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j, cur, tgt);
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1, cur, tgt);
```
- **Line 27-30**: The DFS function calls itself recursively for all four possible directions (down, right, up, left) to mark all connected `0`s.

```cpp
    }
};
```
- **Line 31-32**: The closing brackets for the `dfs` function and the `Solution` class.

### Complexity Analysis
1. **Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity of this solution is \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns in the grid. Each cell is visited at most once during the two DFS traversals.

2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(m \times n)\) in the worst case due to the recursion stack space used by DFS in the case of a fully connected grid of `0`s.

### Conclusion
The `closedIsland` function effectively identifies the number of closed islands within a 2D grid using a depth-first search algorithm. The combination of marking border islands and counting closed islands allows the function to efficiently navigate through the grid while avoiding redundant checks.

This approach showcases the power of DFS in graph traversal and the utility of marking visited nodes to prevent multiple counts. The time and space complexities are optimal for this problem, ensuring that even larger grids can be processed within reasonable limits.

In conclusion, the solution is both robust and efficient, making it a solid example of how to handle similar problems in competitive programming or algorithm design. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the grid's structure and applying systematic techniques to solve complex spatial problems.
