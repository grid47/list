### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find the sum of all integers from `1` to `n` that are divisible by either `3`, `5`, or `7`. Given a positive integer `n`, we need to iterate through the integers from `1` to `n` and check if any of these numbers are divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`. If so, they should be added to the sum. Finally, the program should return this sum.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to identify all integers from `1` to `n` that are divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`. To do this efficiently:
1. **Iterate through the numbers**: We need to check each integer from `1` to `n` and determine if it's divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`.
2. **Check divisibility**: For each number, check if the number is divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`. If any of these conditions hold true, add that number to the sum.
3. **Return the sum**: After iterating through all numbers, return the accumulated sum.

This approach ensures that all numbers divisible by any of `3`, `5`, or `7` are included in the final sum.

### Code Breakdown

1. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   int sumOfMultiples(int n) {
       int sum = 0;
       for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
           if((i % 3 == 0) || (i % 5 == 0) || (i % 7 == 0))
               sum += i;
       return sum;
   }
   ```

2. **Initialization**:
   - `int sum = 0;`: Initializes a variable `sum` to store the cumulative sum of numbers divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`.

3. **Loop through the numbers**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
   ```
   - The loop iterates over all integers from `1` to `n`. The variable `i` represents each integer being checked.

4. **Condition check**:
   ```cpp
   if((i % 3 == 0) || (i % 5 == 0) || (i % 7 == 0))
   ```
   - For each number `i`, the condition checks if `i` is divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`.
     - `i % 3 == 0`: Checks if the number is divisible by `3`.
     - `i % 5 == 0`: Checks if the number is divisible by `5`.
     - `i % 7 == 0`: Checks if the number is divisible by `7`.
   - If any of these conditions are true, the number `i` is added to the sum.

5. **Updating the sum**:
   ```cpp
   sum += i;
   ```
   - If the number `i` meets the divisibility condition, it's added to `sum`.

6. **Return the result**:
   ```cpp
   return sum;
   ```
   - After the loop finishes, the function returns the `sum` variable, which now contains the sum of all numbers divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:  
  The time complexity is **O(n)** because we are iterating through all numbers from `1` to `n`. For each number, we perform a constant number of operations (the modulus check and conditional check). Therefore, the time complexity is directly proportional to the size of `n`.
  
- **Space Complexity**:  
  The space complexity is **O(1)** since we only use a few variables (`sum` and `i`) that occupy constant space, regardless of the input size.

### Conclusion

This solution effectively finds the sum of all multiples of `3`, `5`, or `7` between `1` and `n` using a straightforward approach that checks each number for divisibility. The time complexity of **O(n)** makes it efficient for small to moderate values of `n`. The space complexity is **O(1)**, as the algorithm uses a constant amount of space, making it space-efficient as well. 

The logic is simple, and the approach works well for a wide range of input sizes. If optimization is required for very large values of `n`, more advanced methods such as the inclusion-exclusion principle could be used, but for most practical purposes, this solution provides an optimal balance of simplicity and performance.
