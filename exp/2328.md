### Problem Statement

The problem asks to count the number of strictly increasing paths in a given 2D grid. A path is defined as a sequence of grid cells such that each cell in the path has a strictly greater value than the previous cell. The problem requires us to compute the number of such paths modulo \(10^9 + 7\), considering all possible starting cells in the grid and all possible directions (up, down, left, right).

### Approach

This problem can be efficiently solved using **dynamic programming** with **memoization**. We will approach the problem in the following steps:

1. **Grid Representation:**
   - The input is a 2D grid, where each cell has an integer value. The task is to find all possible strictly increasing paths from any cell.

2. **Memoization Approach:**
   - We use a **2D DP table** (`dp[i][j]`) to store the number of increasing paths starting from the cell `(i, j)`. This helps avoid redundant calculations and speeds up the process.
   - The value of `dp[i][j]` is computed by exploring all four possible directions (up, down, left, right) from the current cell and recursively calculating the number of increasing paths from the neighboring cells.
   - If a neighboring cell has a value greater than the current cell, we add the result of the recursive call for that neighboring cell to the current cell’s count of paths.

3. **Recursive Function (`mem`):**
   - The recursive function `mem(i, j, grid)` computes the number of increasing paths starting at the cell `(i, j)`. If the result has already been computed (i.e., `dp[i][j]` is not -1), it directly returns that result.
   - Otherwise, it checks all four directions (up, down, left, right) and recursively calculates the number of valid paths from the neighboring cells where the value is strictly greater than the current cell. The total number of paths for `(i, j)` is the sum of the paths from all valid neighboring cells.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the number of paths can grow large, the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to prevent overflow and ensure the result fits within the problem’s constraints.

5. **Final Count:**
   - We iterate over each cell in the grid and use the `mem` function to calculate the number of increasing paths starting from that cell. The results are accumulated and returned as the final count of strictly increasing paths in the grid.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### Step 1: Initialization

```cpp
int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
vector<vector<int>> dp;
```

- The variable `mod` is set to \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure results are computed within the given modulo constraint.
- The `dp` 2D vector is declared, which will store the number of strictly increasing paths starting at each grid cell. Initially, this is filled with `-1` to indicate uncalculated cells.

#### Step 2: Memoization Function

```cpp
int mem(int i, int j, vector<vector<int>> & grid) {
    long res = 1;
    if(dp[i][j] != -1) return dp[i][j];
    int dir[] = {0, 1, 0, -1, 0};
    for(int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
        int x = i + dir[k], y = j + dir[k + 1];
        if(x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= dp.size() || y >= dp[0].size() || grid[x][y] <= grid[i][j])
            continue;
        res = (res + mem(x, y, grid)) % mod;
    }
    return dp[i][j] = res % mod;
}
```

- The function `mem(i, j, grid)` calculates the number of strictly increasing paths starting from the cell `(i, j)`.
- The `res` variable is initialized to 1, as a single cell itself forms a valid increasing path of length 1.
- If the result for the current cell has already been computed (i.e., `dp[i][j] != -1`), it returns the cached result.
- The `dir[]` array is used to define the four possible movement directions (right, down, left, up).
- The function checks for each direction whether the neighboring cell is within bounds and has a strictly greater value. If so, it recursively calls `mem(x, y, grid)` to calculate the paths starting from the neighboring cell and adds it to `res`.
- The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow, and `dp[i][j]` is updated with the computed result.

#### Step 3: Counting Paths

```cpp
int countPaths(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
    dp.resize(m, vector<int>(n, -1));
    long res = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
        for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            res = (res + mem(i, j, grid)) % mod;
    return res;
}
```

- The function `countPaths(grid)` initializes the dimensions of the grid (`m` for rows, `n` for columns).
- The `dp` table is resized to fit the grid's dimensions, and all values are initialized to `-1` to indicate uncalculated cells.
- A variable `res` is initialized to 0. This will store the total number of strictly increasing paths in the grid.
- We iterate over every cell in the grid and call the `mem(i, j, grid)` function to calculate the number of increasing paths starting from that cell. The results are accumulated into `res`, which is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- Finally, the total number of paths is returned.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.
- For each cell `(i, j)`, the recursive function `mem(i, j)` explores all four neighboring directions. However, due to memoization, each cell is computed only once, making the time complexity proportional to the size of the grid, i.e., **O(m * n)**.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(m * n)** due to the `dp` table, which stores the results of all subproblems (i.e., the number of paths starting from each cell).
- Additionally, the recursion stack might also require space, but it is bounded by the grid's size, so the overall space complexity remains **O(m * n)**.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently counts the number of strictly increasing paths in a 2D grid using dynamic programming with memoization. By caching the results of subproblems (i.e., the number of increasing paths starting from each cell), the solution avoids redundant calculations and reduces the time complexity to **O(m * n)**. The result is calculated modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow and meet the problem's constraints. This approach is both time and space efficient, making it suitable for large grids.
