### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`. Solve it without using division and in \(O(n)\) time complexity.

### Approach
The solution builds two auxiliary arrays:
1. **Prefix Product Array (`pre`)**: `pre[i]` holds the product of all elements from the start up to `i`.
2. **Suffix Product Array (`suf`)**: `suf[i]` holds the product of all elements from `i` to the end.

Then, for each index `i` in the result array:
- `answer[i]` is computed as the product of `pre[i - 1]` (all elements before `i`) and `suf[i + 1]` (all elements after `i`).

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: A vector `nums` of integers.
- **Output**: A vector `answer` where each `answer[i]` is the product of all elements in `nums` except `nums[i]`.

1. Initialize `pre` and `suf` vectors of size `n`, both with initial values of 1.
2. Compute `pre[i]` by multiplying `pre[i - 1]` by `nums[i]`.
3. Compute `suf[i]` by multiplying `suf[i + 1]` by `nums[i]`.
4. Fill `answer[i]` using `pre[i - 1] * suf[i + 1]`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the size of `nums`, due to single-pass calculations for `pre`, `suf`, and `answer`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), due to the extra storage for `pre`, `suf`, and `answer` arrays.

### Optimized Approach
This solution could be optimized to \(O(1)\) additional space (output array excluded) by computing prefix and suffix products in-place.
