### Problem Statement
Given a list of words and a maximum width for a line, format the text so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters. Each line should be fully justified, meaning that extra spaces should be distributed evenly among the words.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**: Create a result vector to store the formatted lines, and initialize variables for tracking the starting index of the current line (`begin`) and the cumulative length of words in the current line (`len`).
2. **Iterate Over Words**: Loop through each word in the input:
   - If adding the current word exceeds the `maxWidth`, call the helper function to create a justified line from `begin` to the current word, then reset `begin` and `len`.
   - Add the current word's length to `len`.
3. **Handle Last Line**: After the loop, handle the last line differently to ensure it is left-justified (spaces added only at the end).
4. **Justification Logic**: Use a helper function to create a justified string from a range of words:
   - Calculate the total number of spaces needed and distribute them evenly between the words. If there are leftover spaces, distribute them from the leftmost gap.
   - If it’s the last line, left-justify by appending spaces to the end.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Main Function**: 
   - Iterate over the words, checking if the cumulative length exceeds `maxWidth`.
   - If it does, call `connect` to format the current line and reset the tracking variables.
   - Finally, format the last line and add it to the result.
   
2. **Connect Function**:
   - Builds a justified string by iterating through the words between `begin` and `end`.
   - Calls `addSpaces` to handle spacing between words based on whether it’s the last line or not.
   - Adds any remaining spaces at the end of the line if necessary.

3. **Add Spaces Function**:
   - Calculates how many spaces to add based on whether the line is the last one and how many gaps exist.
   - Appends the calculated spaces to the current line string.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the total number of characters in the `words`, as each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \), as the result string will store the formatted output, which can be at most \( n \) characters.
