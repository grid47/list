### Problem Statement
Determine if the given permutation `nums` is an "ideal" permutation. A permutation is considered ideal if no element is greater than any element that appears two positions after it.

### Approach
1. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - Maintain a variable `cmax` to track the maximum value encountered so far.
   - Loop through the array from the start up to `n - 2` (to avoid out-of-bounds access).
   - For each element at index `i`, update `cmax` to be the maximum of `cmax` and `nums[i]`.
   - Check if `cmax` is greater than `nums[i + 2]`. If it is, return `false` since the condition for an ideal permutation is violated.
   
2. **Final Return**:
   - If no violations are found during the iteration, return `true`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method for checking ideal permutations.

- **Method**:
  - `bool isIdealPermutation(vector<int>& nums)`: Implements the logic to verify if the permutation is ideal.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array, since it iterates through the array only once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space for variables.
