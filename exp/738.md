### Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `n`, find the largest number that is less than or equal to `n` and consists of monotone increasing digits (i.e., digits from left to right never decrease).

### Approach
1. **String Conversion**:
   - Convert the integer `n` to a string for easy manipulation of its digits.

2. **Identify Decrease**:
   - Iterate from the rightmost digit to the left:
     - If a digit is found that is less than its predecessor (i.e., `n_str[i] < n_str[i - 1]`), mark this position.
     - Decrement the predecessor digit to ensure a monotone increasing condition.

3. **Set Following Digits**:
   - Change all digits to the right of the marked position to '9', creating the largest possible number.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Convert the modified string back to an integer and return it.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the main method for processing the number.

- **Method**:
  - `int monotoneIncreasingDigits(int n)`: Implements the logic to compute the largest monotone increasing number.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(D), where D is the number of digits in `n`, due to the linear traversal of the string representation.
- **Space Complexity**: O(D) for storing the string representation of the number.
