### Problem Statement

The problem requires finding the largest **monotone increasing number** less than or equal to a given number `n`. A number is called **monotone increasing** if its digits are in non-decreasing order from left to right. For example, 1234 is a monotone increasing number, whereas 5432 is not.

Given an integer `n`, we need to modify its digits to form the largest number that satisfies the condition of being monotone increasing while being less than or equal to `n`. The solution should return this modified number.

### Approach

The approach to solving this problem is based on **greedy algorithms** and **digit manipulation**:
1. Convert the number `n` to a string to process each digit individually.
2. Start from the least significant digit (the rightmost one) and move towards the most significant digit.
3. If we find that a digit is smaller than the digit before it (i.e., it violates the monotone increasing property), we backtrack to the point of violation and adjust the digits to ensure they form a valid monotone increasing number.
4. Once the violation is handled, change all digits after the violation to `9` to maximize the number while maintaining the monotone increasing property.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Convert the integer to a string**:
   We begin by converting the number `n` into a string (`n_str`) to simplify the process of comparing and modifying the digits.

   ```cpp
   string n_str = to_string(n);
   ```

2. **Initialize a marker**:
   The `marker` variable is used to track the position at which the number starts violating the monotone increasing property. Initially, it is set to the size of the number string, meaning that we assume the number is monotone increasing.

   ```cpp
   int marker = n_str.size();
   ```

3. **Traverse the number from right to left**:
   The loop starts from the second-to-last digit and moves towards the leftmost digit. This helps to identify the point where a digit is smaller than the one before it.

   ```cpp
   for (int i = n_str.size() - 1; i > 0; i--) {
       if (n_str[i] < n_str[i - 1]) {
           marker = i;
           n_str[i - 1] = n_str[i - 1] - 1;
       }
   }
   ```

   - If the current digit (`n_str[i]`) is smaller than the digit before it (`n_str[i - 1]`), we have found a violation of the monotone increasing condition.
   - To correct this, we reduce the previous digit (`n_str[i - 1]`) by 1 and update the `marker` to `i`. This ensures that we have a valid monotone increasing sequence up to the digit at position `i - 1`.

4. **Set digits after the violation to 9**:
   After adjusting the digits up to the point of violation, we set all digits after the violation to `9`. This ensures the largest possible value for the number that still satisfies the monotone increasing condition.

   ```cpp
   for (int i = marker; i < n_str.size(); i++)
       n_str[i] = '9';
   ```

5. **Convert the string back to an integer**:
   After adjusting the digits, we convert the string back to an integer using `stoi` and return the result.

   ```cpp
   return stoi(n_str);
   ```

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(d)**, where `d` is the number of digits in the number `n`. We perform a linear scan of the digits of the number twice (once for finding the violation and once for updating digits after the violation). Therefore, the time complexity is proportional to the number of digits in the number, making it efficient even for large numbers.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(d)**, where `d` is the number of digits in `n`. We store the digits of the number in a string (`n_str`), which requires space proportional to the number of digits in `n`.

Thus, the space complexity is linear with respect to the number of digits in the input number.

### Conclusion

This approach efficiently handles the problem of finding the largest monotone increasing number less than or equal to a given number `n`. By iterating over the digits of the number from right to left, we can identify the point of violation and adjust the digits accordingly. Setting digits after the violation to `9` maximizes the result while preserving the monotone increasing property. The solution runs in linear time relative to the number of digits, making it suitable for large numbers.

The code is simple and uses a greedy strategy to ensure the largest possible result. This makes it an optimal solution to the problem, as it processes the digits efficiently while maintaining correctness in terms of both time and space complexity.
