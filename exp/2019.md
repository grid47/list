### Problem Statement

The problem involves evaluating mathematical expressions represented as strings and scoring the students' answers based on their correctness. Given an expression containing non-negative single-digit integers and the operators '+' and '*', students provide their answers, and the goal is to determine how many points each student earns based on the correctness of their answers compared to the correct value of the expression.

The scoring system is as follows:
- If a student's answer matches the correct answer, they earn 5 points.
- If a student's answer does not match but is found in the set of possible values that could be derived from the expression using the correct order of operations, they earn 2 points.
- If the answer is not correct and not part of the possible values, the student earns 0 points.

### Approach

To solve the problem, the solution involves the following key steps:

1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - Utilize a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[start][end]` stores a set of all possible values that can be computed from the substring of the expression between the indices `start` and `end`.
   - The size of the table is determined by the number of operands in the expression, as there are `n` operands and `n - 1` operators.

2. **Parsing the Expression**:
   - A helper function `parse()` computes the correct value of the expression by applying the order of operations (i.e., multiplication before addition).
   - The function iterates over the string, processes each character, and handles the operations appropriately, using a stack to manage the current numbers and results.

3. **Building the DP Table**:
   - For each possible sub-expression defined by the indices in the `dp` table, compute all possible values by combining results from left and right partitions around each operator in the expression.
   - Use the operator to determine how to combine the values (either summing them for '+' or multiplying them for '*').
   - Ensure that only results less than or equal to 1000 are stored in the sets to keep the computation manageable.

4. **Scoring the Answers**:
   - Compare each student's answer against the correct value obtained from the `parse()` function and the set of possible values in `dp[0][n-1]`.
   - Calculate the total score based on the defined scoring rules.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, return the total score that the students earned based on their answers.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Here's a detailed breakdown of the code implementation:

```java
class Solution {
```
- We define a class `Solution` that will contain the main method to compute the scores.

```java
    public int scoreOfStudents(String s, int[] answers) {
```
- The `scoreOfStudents` method takes a string `s`, representing the mathematical expression, and an array of integers `answers`, representing the students' responses.

```java
        int n = (int) (s.length() / 2 + 1);
        Set<Integer>[][] dp = new Set[n][n];
```
- Calculate the number of operands `n` in the expression and initialize the `dp` table.

```java
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = new HashSet();
            dp[i][i].add(s.charAt(2 * i) - '0');
        }
```
- Initialize the diagonal of the `dp` table. Each operand is stored in its corresponding position in the table.

```java
        for(int dif = 1; dif < n; dif++) {
```
- Iterate over possible differences in the indices, which represent sub-expressions of increasing size.

```java
            for(int start = 0; start < n - dif; start++) {
                int end = start + dif;
                dp[start][end] = new HashSet<>();
```
- For each pair of start and end indices, initialize a new set to hold possible values for that sub-expression.

```java
                for(int i = 2 * start + 1; i < 2 * end; i += 2) {
```
- Iterate over the operators in the current sub-expression.

```java
                    if (s.charAt(i) == '+') {
```
- Check if the current operator is '+' and calculate possible sums.

```java
                        for(int a : dp[start][(int) (i / 2)])
                        for(int b : dp[(int) (i / 2) + 1][end])
                            if(a + b <= 1000) dp[start][end].add(a + b);
                    } else {
```
- If the operator is '*', calculate possible products.

```java
                        for(int a : dp[start][(int) (i / 2)])
                        for(int b : dp[(int) (i / 2) + 1][end])
                            if(a + b <= 1000) dp[start][end].add(a * b);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
```
- After processing all operators for the current sub-expression, continue to the next size.

```java
        int crct = parse(s), ans = 0;
```
- Calculate the correct value of the expression using the `parse` function.

```java
        for (int x : answers) {
            if (x == crct)                ans += 5;
            else if (dp[0][n - 1].contains(x)) ans += 2;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```
- For each student's answer, compare it to the correct answer and the possible values stored in `dp[0][n-1]`, updating the score accordingly.

```java
    private int parse(String s) {
        List<Integer> stk = new ArrayList();
        int num = 0;
        char op = '+';
```
- The `parse` function initializes a stack to evaluate the expression and tracks the current number and operation.

```java
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
```
- Loop through each character in the string.

```java
            if(ch >= '0' && ch <= '9') {
                num = ch - '0';
            }
```
- If the character is a digit, convert it to an integer.

```java
            if(i == s.length() - 1 || ch == '+' || ch == '*' ) {
```
- Check if we have reached the end of the string or found an operator.

```java
                if (op == '+') {
                    stk.add(num);
                } else {
                    int y = stk.get(stk.size() - 1);
                    stk.remove(stk.size() - 1);
                    stk.add(y * num);
                }
```
- Based on the previous operator, either add the number to the stack or multiply it with the last number in the stack.

```java
                num = 0;
                op = ch;
            }
        }
```
- Reset the current number and update the operation.

```java
        int res = 0;
        for(int x : stk) res += x;
        return res;
    }
}
```
- Sum all numbers in the stack to get the final result of the expression and return it.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity of this solution is O(n^3), where n is the number of operands. This is due to the nested loops for populating the `dp` table.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n^2) for storing sets of possible values in the `dp` table.

### Conclusion

The combination of dynamic programming and parsing allows for a comprehensive yet clear approach to handling this problem.

The clear structure of the code, with well-defined functions and encapsulated logic, enhances both readability and maintainability.
