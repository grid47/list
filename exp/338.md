### Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `n`, your task is to return an array `res` of length `n + 1` where `res[i]` represents the number of `1` bits in the binary representation of the integer `i` for all integers in the range `0` to `n`.

### Approach
To solve the problem efficiently, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The key observation is that the number of `1` bits in a number can be derived from the number of `1` bits in its half and whether the least significant bit is set or not.

1. **Dynamic Programming Formula**:
   - For each integer `i`, the number of `1` bits can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{res}[i] = \text{res}[i >> 1] + (i \& 1)
     \]
   - Here, `i >> 1` shifts `i` to the right by one bit (equivalent to dividing by 2), and `i & 1` checks if the least significant bit of `i` is `1`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Start by initializing an array `res` of size `n + 1` with all values set to `0`.

3. **Iterate from 0 to n**:
   - Fill the array using the formula for all integers from `0` to `n`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: An integer `n`.
- **Output**: A vector of integers representing the count of `1` bits for each integer from `0` to `n`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), as we iterate through each number from `0` to `n` once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), due to the storage of the result array `res`.
