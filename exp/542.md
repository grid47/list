### Problem Statement
Given a binary matrix `mat` containing only 0s and 1s, find the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell. The distance is defined as the number of steps (up, down, left, right) from the cell to the nearest 0. Cells with 0s have a distance of 0.

### Approach
1. **BFS Initialization**:
   - Use a queue to perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS). Initialize the queue with all the cells that contain 0s, as these are the starting points.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Maintain a distance variable (`dis`) which increments at each level of BFS.
   - For each cell processed, update its distance and explore its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor is not yet visited, push it into the queue for further processing.

3. **Boundary Checks**:
   - Ensure that when accessing neighboring cells, you stay within the bounds of the matrix.

### Code Walk-through
- Initialize a queue with the positions of all 0s in the matrix. 
- Set up a 2D vector `vis` to keep track of visited cells.
- Perform BFS while maintaining the current distance. Update the distance of each cell to the current distance when processing it.
- For each cell processed, check its four neighbors and add them to the queue if they haven't been visited yet.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns, since we may need to visit every cell in the matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the queue and the visited matrix, which may hold up to `m * n` elements in the worst case.
