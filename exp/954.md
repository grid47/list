### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, determine if it can be reordered such that for every element `x`, there exists an element `2x`.

### Approach
1. **Count Occurrences**:
   - Use an unordered map to count the occurrences of each element in the array.

2. **Sort Unique Elements**:
   - Extract the unique keys from the map into a vector.
   - Sort the vector based on the absolute values of the elements. This ensures that we handle negative values properly.

3. **Check Doubling Condition**:
   - Iterate through the sorted keys:
     - For each element `x`, check if the count of `x` is greater than the count of `2x`. If it is, return `false` since there aren't enough pairs.
     - Decrement the count of `2x` by the count of `x` to account for the pairs formed.

4. **Return Result**:
   - If all elements are processed without returning `false`, return `true`.

### Code Walk-through
- The function initializes a count map for the elements.
- It sorts the unique keys based on their absolute values.
- The function checks the doubling condition for each unique element and updates the count accordingly.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This includes counting elements and sorting the keys.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the count map and the keys vector.
