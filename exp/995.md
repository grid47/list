### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to determine the minimum number of flips required to make all bits in an array equal to `1`, where we are allowed to flip exactly `k` consecutive bits in the array at any point. A bit flip means changing a `0` to `1` or vice versa. If it is impossible to flip the bits in such a way that all bits become `1`, we return `-1`.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize a **greedy algorithm** with the help of a sliding window. The idea is to make sure that when we encounter a `0` in the array, we flip it, but only if the flip can cover the required range (`k` consecutive elements). The challenge comes in ensuring that we keep track of all flips made and avoid unnecessary re-flips while working within the bounds of the array.

### Key Steps in the Approach

1. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - We iterate through the array from left to right, checking each bit.
   
2. **Track Flips**:
   - We maintain a variable `flipped` to track the current flip state. If `flipped` is `0`, it means the current bit is in its original state. If `flipped` is `1`, it means the current bit is flipped.

3. **Making Flips**:
   - When we encounter a `0`, we check if the current index allows for a flip of `k` consecutive bits. If it does, we flip the bits, increment the `res` (result) counter, and mark this flip in a separate array `hasFlipped`.
   
4. **Boundary Check**:
   - If we reach a point where flipping `k` consecutive bits is not possible (i.e., there are not enough remaining bits to flip), we return `-1`.

5. **Efficient Flip Tracking**:
   - To keep track of when a flip stops affecting the array, we use the `hasFlipped` array to record the positions where the flips begin and end.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minKBitFlips(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size(), flipped = 0, res = 0;
        vector<int> hasFlipped(n, 0);  // Tracks whether we need to flip at each position
        vector<int> tmp = nums;  // Copy of the input array to work on
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - We first initialize `n` to store the size of the array, `flipped` to track the current flip status, and `res` to count the number of flips made.
   - `hasFlipped` is an array that stores whether a flip is applied at a specific index, allowing us to manage the sliding window effectively.

```cpp
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {  // Loop through each bit in the array
            if (i >= k) flipped ^= hasFlipped[i - k];  // Remove the effect of flips that are out of range
```

2. **Sliding Window Update**:
   - We start iterating through the array. For each index `i`, if `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, we remove the effect of the flip that started `k` positions earlier by using the XOR operation (`flipped ^= hasFlipped[i - k]`).
   - This allows us to track the current flip status without applying unnecessary flips.

```cpp
            if (flipped == nums[i]) {  // If the current bit is in the wrong state
                if (i + k > nums.size()) return -1;  // Check if we have enough space for the flip
                flipped ^= 1;  // Flip the current bit by toggling `flipped`
                hasFlipped[i] = 1;  // Mark that we performed a flip at position `i`
                res++;  // Increment the flip count
            }
        }
```

3. **Performing a Flip**:
   - If the current state of the bit (`nums[i]`) is not what we want (i.e., it's `0` and we want `1`), we check if we have enough space to flip `k` consecutive bits.
   - If there is not enough space to flip, we immediately return `-1` as it is impossible to achieve the desired outcome.
   - If there is enough space, we flip the bit by toggling the `flipped` variable and mark the flip in `hasFlipped`. We also increment the `res` counter to track the number of flips made.

```cpp
        return res;  // Return the minimum number of flips
    }
};
```

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Once the iteration is complete, we return the total number of flips (`res`) needed to convert all bits to `1`.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the `nums` array. This is because we loop through the array only once, performing constant time operations for each bit.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the `hasFlipped` array, which stores the flip state for each index.

### Conclusion

The solution uses a **greedy approach** with a sliding window mechanism to solve the problem efficiently. By flipping the bits only when necessary and keeping track of the flip effects using the `hasFlipped` array, the algorithm ensures that we meet the problem's constraints and requirements. The time and space complexity of the solution are both optimal for the given problem, making it an efficient and practical solution. The solution is also well-suited to handle edge cases, such as when it's impossible to flip the bits as required, returning `-1` in those situations.
