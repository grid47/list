### Problem Statement
Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, you can flip any subarray of length `k` from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`. Your goal is to return the minimum number of flips required to make all elements in the array equal to `1`. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

### Approach
1. **Tracking Flips**: Use a variable `flipped` to track the current state of flips affecting the current index. An array `hasFlipped` is used to record whether a flip starts at each index.
2. **Iterate Through the Array**: Loop through each index of `nums`:
   - If `i >= k`, adjust `flipped` by removing the effect of flips that started `k` indices earlier.
   - If the current value (considering the flips) is `0`, a flip is needed:
     - Check if a flip can be performed without exceeding the array bounds. If `i + k > n`, return `-1`.
     - Flip the current segment by toggling `flipped` and marking that a flip has started at index `i`.
     - Increment the result counter `res`.
3. **Return the Result**: After processing the array, return the total number of flips required.

### Code Walk-through
- The function initializes necessary variables and iterates through `nums` while adjusting the `flipped` state and counting the flips.
- The condition checks ensure that flips are only made when necessary and possible.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. Each element is processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the auxiliary `hasFlipped` array used to track flips.
