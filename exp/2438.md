### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to calculate the product of specific subsets of the binary representation of a number `n`. The subsets are defined by a range of indices provided in multiple queries. Specifically, for each query, we are given two indices `l` and `r` and need to compute the product of all powers of 2 corresponding to the `1` bits of `n` between these indices, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

For example:
- Given `n = 6`, its binary representation is `110`.
- If a query asks for the product of the powers of 2 corresponding to the bits at indices `0` to `1` (inclusive), we compute the product of \(2^1\) and \(2^2\), which is \(2^1 \times 2^2 = 6\).

The goal is to efficiently compute the results for all the queries.

### Approach

We can break down the problem into a few key steps:
1. **Extract Powers of 2 from the Binary Representation of `n`**: The number `n` can be represented as a sum of powers of 2. We need to extract these powers and store them for use in the queries.
2. **Precompute the Powers of 2**: For each bit in the binary representation of `n`, we can calculate and store the corresponding powers of 2. This will allow us to answer queries about the product of powers of 2 efficiently.
3. **Handle Multiple Queries Efficiently**: Each query provides a range of indices, and we need to compute the product of the powers of 2 corresponding to those indices. To do this efficiently, we can use precomputation and cumulative multiplication.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Code

#### Step 1: Extract Powers of 2 from the Binary Representation of `n`

First, we initialize a vector `pow` to store the powers of 2. We also define an `init` variable set to 1, which will be used to track the powers of 2.

```cpp
vector<long long> pow;
long long init = 1;
while(n) {
    if(n & 1) pow.push_back(init);
    init *= 2;
    n /= 2;
}
```

- We iterate through the binary representation of `n` using a `while` loop. 
- For each bit that is set to 1 (i.e., `n & 1`), we store the corresponding power of 2 in the `pow` vector.
- We then update `init` to the next power of 2 by multiplying it by 2 (`init *= 2`).
- After processing each bit, we divide `n` by 2 (`n /= 2`) to move to the next bit.

At the end of this loop, the `pow` vector contains the powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of `n`.

#### Step 2: Process Each Query

Next, we initialize a vector `ans` to store the results of each query. We then process each query in the `q` vector, where each query is represented by a pair of indices `[l, r]`.

```cpp
vector<int> ans;
for(int i = 0; i < q.size(); i++) {
    int tmp = pow[q[i][0]];
    for(int j = q[i][0] + 1; j <= q[i][1]; j++)
        tmp = (tmp * pow[j]) % mod;
    ans.push_back(tmp);
}
```

- We loop through each query using the index `i`. 
- For each query, we initialize a variable `tmp` with the value of `pow[q[i][0]]`, which is the power of 2 corresponding to the bit at index `q[i][0]`.
- We then loop from `q[i][0] + 1` to `q[i][1]` and multiply `tmp` by the corresponding powers of 2 in the `pow` vector. We also take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to avoid overflow and to ensure the result fits within the problem's constraints.

After processing each query, we push the result into the `ans` vector.

#### Step 3: Return the Results

Finally, after all queries are processed, we return the `ans` vector, which contains the results for all the queries.

```cpp
return ans;
```

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution can be broken down as follows:
- **Extracting Powers of 2**: This operation takes \(O(\log n)\) time because we are iterating through the binary representation of `n`, which has at most \(\log n\) bits.
- **Processing Queries**: For each query, we need to compute the product of powers of 2 in the range `[l, r]`. The worst-case time complexity for each query is \(O(r - l + 1)\), since we iterate over all the indices between `l` and `r`.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: If there are `m` queries and the range of each query is up to \(O(\log n)\), then the overall time complexity is:
  - \(O(\log n + m \cdot (\text{max range length}))\).
  - In the worst case, the maximum range length could be \(O(\log n)\), so the overall time complexity is \(O(m \cdot \log n)\).

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the solution is dominated by the space used to store the powers of 2 and the results:
- **Storing Powers of 2**: The `pow` vector stores the powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in `n`. The size of this vector is proportional to the number of set bits in `n`, which is at most \(O(\log n)\).
- **Storing Results**: The `ans` vector stores the results for each query, and it has a size equal to the number of queries \(m\).
- **Overall Space Complexity**: The overall space complexity is \(O(\log n + m)\).

### Conclusion

The solution efficiently calculates the product of powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of `n` for each query. By leveraging bitwise operations to extract the relevant powers of 2 and using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers, the solution is both time and space efficient.

The approach utilizes the precomputation of powers of 2 corresponding to set bits in `n` and answers each query in linear time relative to the length of the range specified in the query. This makes the solution well-suited for large inputs and multiple queries, achieving a time complexity of \(O(m \cdot \log n)\), where \(m\) is the number of queries and \(n\) is the input number.
