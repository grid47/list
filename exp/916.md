### Problem Statement
Given two arrays of strings `words1` and `words2`, find all the words in `words1` that are universal words, meaning they can cover all the character frequencies of the words in `words2`.

### Approach
1. **Frequency Array for Words in `words2`**:
   - Initialize a frequency array `frq` of size 26 (for each letter of the alphabet) to keep track of the maximum frequency of each character needed to cover `words2`.
   - For each word in `words2`, create a temporary frequency array `tmp` to count the occurrences of each character.
   - Update the `frq` array with the maximum frequency found for each character across all words in `words2`.

2. **Check Words in `words1`**:
   - Initialize a result vector `res` to store the universal words.
   - For each word in `words1`, create a temporary frequency array `tmp` to count the occurrences of each character in the word.
   - Check if this word covers all character frequencies required by `frq`. If it does, add it to the result vector.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return the `res` vector containing all universal words.

### Code Walk-through
- Loop through each word in `words2` to populate the frequency requirements in `frq`.
- Loop through each word in `words1`, comparing its character counts against `frq` to determine if it's a universal word.
- Collect and return the qualifying words.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m + k * 26), where:
  - n is the number of words in `words2`,
  - m is the average length of the words in `words2`,
  - k is the number of words in `words1`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(26) for the frequency arrays used, which is constant.
