### Problem Statement
Given a set of `n` people and a list of dislikes represented as pairs, determine if it is possible to divide these people into two groups such that no two people in the same group dislike each other.

### Approach
The solution employs a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure to manage the grouping of people:

1. **Initialization**: Create a Union-Find structure to handle the relationships and keep track of the connected components.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - Construct an adjacency list representation of the dislikes. Each person is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if they dislike each other.

3. **Union-Find Operations**:
   - For each dislike pair, use the `find` operation to check if both people belong to the same group.
   - If they are in the same group, return `false` as it would create a conflict.
   - If they are not in the same group, use the `uni` operation to merge their groups.

4. **Final Check**: If all pairs can be processed without conflicts, return `true`.

### Code Walk-through
- The `UF` class implements the union-find structure with path compression to efficiently manage and find components.
- The `possibleBipartition` function processes the dislike pairs and utilizes union-find to check for possible bipartitioning.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(N + E) \), where \( N \) is the number of people and \( E \) is the number of dislike pairs. Each union and find operation is almost constant time due to path compression.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(N) \) for the union-find structure and graph representation.
