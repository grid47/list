### Problem Statement:
Given a list of strings `words` and a character `x`, the task is to identify the indices of the words that contain the character `x`. You need to implement a function that returns a list of indices of all the words in the given list that contain the character `x`. If a word contains the character `x`, its index should be included in the result list.

### Approach:
The problem involves iterating through a list of strings, checking each word for the presence of the specified character `x`. If a word contains the character, we append its index to the result list.

To solve the problem efficiently:
1. We loop through the list of words.
2. For each word, we check if the character `x` is present in that word.
3. If the character is found, we store the index of the word in the result list.
4. Finally, we return the result list containing the indices of the words that contain the character `x`.

To perform the check for the presence of the character `x` in a word, we define a helper function `check` that iterates through the characters of the word and checks if any character matches `x`. If we find a match, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step):

#### 1. **Function `findWordsContaining`**:
This function is the main function of the solution. It takes two arguments:
   - `words`: A vector of strings that represents the list of words.
   - `x`: A character that we are looking for in each word.

In this function:
   - We initialize an empty result vector `result` to store the indices of the words that contain the character `x`.
   - We loop through each word in the `words` list, checking if the character `x` is present in the word using the helper function `check`.
   - If `check` returns `true`, indicating that the word contains `x`, we append the current index `i` to the `result` vector.

   ```cpp
   vector<int> findWordsContaining(vector<string>& words, char x) {
       vector<int> result;
       for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
           if (check(words[i], x)) result.push_back(i);
       }
       return result;
   }
   ```

#### 2. **Helper Function `check`**:
This helper function checks whether a given word contains the character `x`. It works as follows:
   - It loops through each character `c` in the word.
   - For each character, it compares `c` with `x`.
   - If a match is found (i.e., `c == x`), the function immediately returns `true`, indicating that the character `x` is present in the word.
   - If no match is found after checking all characters, the function returns `false`.

   ```cpp
   bool check(string& word, char x) {
       for (auto& c : word) {
           if (c == x) return true;
       }
       return false;
   }
   ```

### Complexity:

#### Time Complexity:
- **Outer Loop**: The `findWordsContaining` function iterates over each word in the list `words`, so it runs in \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of words in the input list.
- **Inner Loop**: For each word, we call the `check` function, which iterates through the characters of the word. If the average word length is \(m\), the inner loop runs in \(O(m)\) time for each word.

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(n \times m)\), where:
   - `n` is the number of words in the list.
   - `m` is the average length of the words.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is \(O(n)\) because the `result` vector stores the indices of the words that contain the character `x`, and in the worst case, all words may be included in the result. Additionally, the helper function `check` does not use any extra space, apart from the input word and the loop variables.

Thus, the space complexity is \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of words in the input list.

### Conclusion:
This solution is an efficient way to find the indices of words that contain a given character in a list of strings. The approach uses a straightforward iteration over the list of words, with each word being checked for the presence of the character `x` through a helper function.

#### Key Points:
- The function `findWordsContaining` loops over all words in the input list and checks each word for the character `x`.
- The helper function `check` checks whether a given word contains the character `x`.
- The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \times m)\), where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the average length of the words.
- The space complexity is \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of words, due to the storage of the result indices.

This solution is efficient for typical use cases and works well when the size of the input is moderate. It allows us to quickly identify and return the indices of the words that contain the specified character.
