### Problem Statement
Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, find the minimum ASCII delete sum of characters to make the two strings equal. The delete sum is the sum of the ASCII values of characters that need to be deleted from both strings.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a recursive function `dp(i, j)` to compute the maximum ASCII sum of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the two strings starting from indices `i` and `j`.
   - Use memoization to store previously computed results in a `mem` table to avoid redundant calculations.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If either string is fully traversed (`i == s1.size()` or `j == s2.size()`), return 0.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - If characters at the current indices match (`s1[i] == s2[j]`), add the ASCII value of that character to the result of `dp(i + 1, j + 1)`.
   - Otherwise, calculate the maximum of two possibilities: skipping the current character of `s1` or `s2`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Compute the total ASCII value of both strings.
   - Subtract twice the result of the LCS from the total to get the minimum delete sum.

### Code Walk-through
- **Variables**:
  - `s1` and `s2`: The input strings.
  - `mem`: A memoization table to store results of subproblems.

- **Functions**:
  - `dp(int i, int j)`: Computes the maximum ASCII sum of the LCS using recursion and memoization.
  - `minimumDeleteSum(string s1, string s2)`: Initializes the problem and computes the minimum delete sum.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, due to the memoization of subproblems.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the memoization table.
