### Problem Statement
You are given a collection of pairs where each pair consists of two integers. The pairs represent intervals, and your task is to find the longest chain of pairs such that for a pair `(a, b)` and another pair `(c, d)`, the condition `b < c` holds. 

### Approach
1. **Sorting**:
   - First, sort the pairs based on the first element. If the first elements are equal, sort by the second element. This sorting helps in systematically checking for valid chains.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
   - Create a `dp` vector where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain ending with the `i-th` pair.
   - Initialize all values in `dp` to 1 since each pair can be a chain of length 1 by itself.
   - Use a nested loop: for each pair `i`, check all previous pairs `j` to see if they can form a valid chain.

3. **Update DP Values**:
   - If the second element of the `j-th` pair is less than the first element of the `i-th` pair (`pairs[i][0] > pairs[j][1]`), update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

4. **Find the Maximum**:
   - Keep track of the maximum value in `dp` during the updates, which represents the length of the longest chain.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the maximum chain length found.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Sorting**:
   - The pairs are sorted using a custom comparator defined in the `cmp` function.

2. **DP Initialization**:
   - Initialize `dp` with 1's and set `mx` to track the maximum length.

3. **Nested Loop**:
   - Iterate through each pair and check for previous pairs to update the `dp` values.

4. **Result Computation**:
   - After completing the iterations, `mx` will contain the length of the longest chain.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of pairs, due to the nested loop for updating the `dp` values.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the `dp` array.
