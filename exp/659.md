### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` which is sorted in non-decreasing order. You need to determine if it's possible to split `nums` into one or more subsequences such that each subsequence is a consecutive sequence of integers.

### Approach
1. **Frequency Count**: 
   - Use a hash map `left` to count the occurrences of each number in `nums`.
   - Use another hash map `end` to keep track of how many subsequences end with a particular number.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - For each number in `nums`:
     - If there are no occurrences left in `left`, skip to the next number.
     - Decrement the count in `left` for the current number since we are processing it.
     
3. **Building Subsequences**:
   - If there's a subsequence that ends with `num - 1`, decrement the count of that subsequence in `end` and increment the count for the subsequence ending with `num`.
   - If no subsequence ends with `num - 1`, check if you can start a new subsequence using `num`, `num + 1`, and `num + 2`. If these are available in `left`, decrement their counts and increment the count for the subsequence ending with `num + 2`.
   - If neither condition is satisfied, return `false` since it's not possible to create the required subsequences.

4. **Final Result**:
   - If all numbers are processed successfully, return `true`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in `nums`. Each number is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) in the worst case for the hash maps.

### Code Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes two hash maps for counting occurrences and managing subsequences.
2. **Processing**: A single loop iterates over the array and applies the logic to build or extend subsequences based on the conditions outlined.
3. **Final Check**: If all elements are processed correctly, the function returns `true`.

This method efficiently ensures that we can split the array into the required subsequences by leveraging counting techniques and greedy selection based on the current number's surroundings.
