### Problem Statement
Given two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, and an upper bound `bound`, find all the unique integers that can be expressed as `x^i + y^j` where `i >= 0` and `j >= 0`, and the result is less than or equal to `bound`.

### Approach
1. **Use of Sets**:
   - Utilize an unordered set to store the results to ensure all integers are unique.

2. **Iterate through Powers**:
   - For each power of `x` starting from `x^0` (which is 1), calculate the values until `x^i` exceeds `bound`.
   - For each value of `x^i`, iterate through powers of `y`, starting from `y^0`, and calculate `x^i + y^j` until the sum exceeds `bound`.

3. **Handle Special Cases**:
   - If either `x` or `y` is 1, handle the case separately to avoid infinite loops since any power of 1 remains 1.

### Code Walk-through
1. **`powerfulIntegers` Method**:
   - Initializes an unordered set `s` to store the results.
   - Uses a loop to calculate powers of `x`, and for each power of `x`, it computes powers of `y`.
   - Inserts the sum `x^i + y^j` into the set if it is within the specified `bound`.
   - Breaks early for `x` or `y` equal to 1 to avoid infinite calculations.

2. **Return the Result**:
   - Converts the set into a vector and returns it.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log(bound) * log(bound)) in the worst case, depending on the number of unique powers generated for `x` and `y`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of unique integers stored in the set.
