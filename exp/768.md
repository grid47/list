### Problem Statement
Given an array `arr`, the task is to divide it into the maximum number of chunks such that when each chunk is sorted individually and then concatenated, the result is a sorted array.

### Approach
1. **Pairing and Sorting**:
   - Create a vector of pairs where each pair contains the value from the original array and its corresponding index.
   - Sort this vector based on the values.

2. **Chunk Counting**:
   - Initialize a variable `mx` to track the maximum index encountered so far as you iterate through the sorted pairs.
   - For each index `i`, if `mx` equals `i`, it indicates that all elements up to index `i` can form a valid chunk, and you can increment the chunk count (`res`).

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method for counting the maximum chunks.

- **Method**:
  - `int maxChunksToSorted(vector<int>& arr)`: Implements the logic to determine the maximum number of chunks.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the length of the array, due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the pairs of values and indices.
