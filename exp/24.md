### Problem Statement
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. If the number of nodes is odd, the last node should remain unchanged.

### Approach
1. **Base Case**: 
   - If the list is empty or contains only one node, return the head as no swaps can be performed.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Define pointers: 
     - `cur` to track the current node.
     - `nxt` to track the next node (which will be swapped with `cur`).
     - `ret` to store the new head of the modified list (which will be the second node).
     - `prv` to keep track of the previous node to correctly link the swapped pairs.

3. **Swapping Process**:
   - Iterate through the list while both `cur` and `nxt` are not null:
     - Update the `next` of the previous node (`prv`) to point to the next node (`nxt`).
     - Set `prv` to the current node (`cur`).
     - Adjust the `next` pointers to swap `cur` and `nxt`.
     - Move `cur` to the next node in the original sequence (which is now the node after the swapped pair).
     - Update `nxt` to the node after `cur` for the next swap.

4. **Return the New Head**: After all swaps, return `ret`, which points to the new head of the swapped list.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Base Condition Check**: The function immediately returns the head if itâ€™s null or has only one node.
2. **Pointer Initialization**: 
   - `cur` starts at the head, and `nxt` points to the second node. 
   - `ret` stores the new head (the second node).
3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - In the loop, the pointers are rearranged to perform the swap.
   - Ensure to check for `cur` and `nxt` being non-null before attempting to access their values.
4. **Return the Result**: Finally, the function returns the new head of the list after all necessary swaps.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) since the swapping is done in place and only a constant amount of additional space is used for pointers.
