### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree and a target node, the goal is to find all nodes that are exactly `k` distance away from the target node. The distance between two nodes is defined as the number of edges in the path connecting them.

### Approach
1. **Mapping Parent Nodes**: 
   - Utilize a map to associate each child node with its parent. This allows traversal back to the parent node when necessary.
   - A helper function `parents(TreeNode* node)` performs a depth-first traversal of the tree to populate this map.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: 
   - Perform a DFS starting from the target node. Keep track of visited nodes using a set to avoid revisiting.
   - When reaching a node that is `k` distance from the target, add its value to the result list.
   - The DFS explores left and right child nodes as well as the parent node using the previously created map.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle scenarios where the tree is empty or the target node is null.

### Code Walk-through
- The `parents` function recursively maps each child to its parent.
- The `distanceK` function initializes the process by mapping parents and then calling the DFS from the target node.
- The `dfs` function explores the tree and collects nodes at distance `k`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once during the mapping and once during the DFS.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the parent mapping and visited nodes, as well as for the result list.
