### Problem Statement

In the game "Stone Game III," Alice and Bob take turns removing stones from a pile. The player whose turn it is can take 1, 2, or 3 stones, and the game continues until there are no stones left. The objective of each player is to maximize their total score, which is the sum of the values of the stones they have taken. Given the values of the stones in an array, the goal is to determine the winner of the game, or if the game ends in a tie.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we will use a dynamic programming approach. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the strategy:

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: We will first compute a prefix sum array to store the cumulative values of stones from the end of the list to facilitate quick score calculations.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Array**: We will utilize a memoization array to store the results of subproblems. This will help avoid redundant calculations and improve the efficiency of our solution.

3. **Recursion with Memoization**: We will define a recursive function to calculate the maximum score Alice can achieve from a given index. The function will explore all possible moves (taking 1, 2, or 3 stones) and calculate the resulting score for Alice based on Bob's optimal responses.

4. **Score Calculation**: For each valid move, we calculate the sum of the stones Alice can take and then subtract the score that Bob would earn in the subsequent turns. This will allow us to determine the best possible outcome for Alice.

5. **Final Score Comparison**: After calculating Alice's score using the DP approach, we can determine Bob's score as the total stones minus Alice's score. Finally, we will compare the scores to declare the winner or a tie.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Below is a detailed breakdown of the provided C++ code implementing the above logic:

1. **Class Definition**:
   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
   ```

   - A class named `Solution` is defined to contain the method `stoneGameIII`.

2. **Member Variables**:
   ```cpp
       int n;
       vector<int> pox, memo;
   ```

   - We declare the following member variables:
     - `n`: an integer to hold the number of stones.
     - `pox`: a vector to hold the prefix sums of the stones.
     - `memo`: a vector for memoization to store intermediate results of the DP calculations.

3. **DP Function**:
   ```cpp
       int dp(int idx) {
           if(idx == n) return 0;
           if(memo[idx] != -1) return memo[idx];
   ```

   - The `dp` function takes an index `idx` as a parameter and performs the following:
     - Returns 0 if the index is equal to `n`, indicating that there are no stones left.
     - Checks if the result for this index has already been computed and stored in `memo`. If so, it returns the stored value.

4. **Score Calculation**:
   ```cpp
           int ans = INT_MIN;
           for(int i = 0; i < 3 && idx + i < n; i++) {
               int sum = pox[idx] - pox[idx + i + 1];
               ans = max(ans, sum + pox[idx + i + 1] - dp(idx + i + 1));
           }
   ```

   - Initializes `ans` to negative infinity to ensure any valid score will be larger.
   - A loop iterates over the possible moves (1, 2, or 3 stones) as long as the move does not exceed the bounds of the array:
     - Calculates the sum of the stones Alice would take in the current move.
     - Updates `ans` by taking the maximum of the current answer and the score Alice could achieve after this move, factoring in Bob’s response (calculated using the DP function).

5. **Storing Results**:
   ```cpp
           return memo[idx] = ans;
       }
   ```

   - The computed maximum score for this index is stored in the `memo` array for future reference and then returned.

6. **Main Function**:
   ```cpp
       string stoneGameIII(vector<int>& sv) {
           n = sv.size();
           memo.resize(n, -1);
           pox.resize(n + 1, 0);
   ```

   - The `stoneGameIII` function initializes the process:
     - Sets `n` to the size of the input vector `sv`.
     - Resizes the `memo` array to hold `n` entries, initialized to -1.
     - Resizes the `pox` array to hold `n + 1` entries, initialized to 0.

7. **Building the Prefix Sum**:
   ```cpp
           for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--)
               pox[i] = pox[i + 1] + sv[i];
   ```

   - A loop calculates the prefix sums by iterating backwards through the `sv` array, where each `pox[i]` holds the sum of values from `sv[i]` to the end of the array.

8. **Calculating Scores**:
   ```cpp
           int net = pox[0];
           int alice = dp(0);
           int bob = net - alice;
   ```

   - `net` is set to the total score of all stones.
   - `alice` is calculated by invoking the `dp` function starting from index 0.
   - `bob` is derived by subtracting Alice's score from the total score.

9. **Determine the Winner**:
   ```cpp
           if(bob == alice) return "Tie";
           if(alice > bob) return "Alice";
           return "Bob";
       }
   };
   ```

   - The final scores are compared:
     - If Bob’s score equals Alice’s score, the result is "Tie".
     - If Alice's score is greater, the result is "Alice".
     - Otherwise, the result is "Bob".

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The time complexity of this solution is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of stones. This is because we compute the prefix sums in linear time and the recursive DP calculations involve a linear traversal of the `sv` array.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \( O(n) \) due to the usage of the `memo` and `pox` vectors, which both store information proportional to the number of stones.

### Conclusion

The implementation of the "Stone Game III" problem leverages dynamic programming to efficiently determine the outcome of the game. By combining memoization with a prefix sum approach, this solution is able to optimally calculate the maximum score that Alice can achieve, allowing for straightforward comparison against Bob's score. The approach ensures that both players play optimally, reflecting realistic strategies one would expect in a competitive scenario.

#### Key Takeaways:

- **Dynamic Programming**: The use of DP allows for efficient computation of overlapping subproblems, which is crucial in game-theory scenarios like this one.
- **Prefix Sums**: Utilizing a prefix sum array simplifies the score calculations, allowing for quick access to the total score from any index.
