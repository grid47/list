### Problem Statement
Generate the Gray code sequence of `n` bits. The Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

### Approach
1. **Initialize**: Start with a single element `0` in the result vector `res`.
2. **Iterate through bits**: For each bit position `idx` (from 0 to `n-1`):
   - Determine the current size of `res`.
   - Reverse iterate over `res` to create new values by setting the `idx`-th bit to `1` in each value. This is done using `res[jdx] | (1 << idx)`.
   - Append each new value to `res`.
3. **Return Result**: Once all `n` bits have been processed, `res` contains the Gray code sequence for `n` bits.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: Start with `res = {0}`.
2. **Outer Loop**: For each bit position `idx` from 0 to `n-1`.
3. **Inner Loop**: Iterate over `res` in reverse to generate new values by setting the current bit and append them to `res`.
4. **Return Result**: The final `res` contains the Gray code sequence.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(2^n)\), since we generate each Gray code value for `n` bits.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(2^n)\), as we store each unique Gray code sequence in `res`.
