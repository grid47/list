### Problem Statement
Determine if two binary trees are identical. Two binary trees are considered identical if they have the same structure and the same node values.

### Approach
This solution uses a **recursive comparison** of the two trees:
1. **Base Cases**:
   - If both nodes (`p` and `q`) are `NULL`, the trees are identical at this point, so return `true`.
   - If one of the nodes is `NULL` while the other is not, return `false` since the trees differ in structure.
2. **Value Comparison**:
   - Compare the values of the current nodes. If they are not equal, return `false`.
3. **Recursive Calls**:
   - Recursively check the left subtrees (`p->left` and `q->left`) and the right subtrees (`p->right` and `q->right`).
   - Use the logical AND operator (`&=`) to ensure that all conditions must hold true for the trees to be considered identical.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Check Both Nodes**: Begin by checking if both nodes are `NULL`, returning `true` if so.
2. **Check for Structure**: If only one node is `NULL`, return `false`.
3. **Compare Values**: Compare the values of the current nodes.
4. **Recursive Check**: Recursively validate both the left and right subtrees. 
5. **Return Result**: The final result is based on the combination of all checks.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the trees, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack used in the function calls.
