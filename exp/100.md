### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to determine if two **binary trees** are **identical** or **not**. Two binary trees are considered identical if they have the same structure and node values. Specifically:
- Both trees must have the same number of nodes.
- The values of corresponding nodes must be the same.
- The structure (i.e., the left and right children of every node) must be identical.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a **recursive** approach to compare the two binary trees. The algorithm follows the **divide-and-conquer** strategy where we:
1. Compare the root nodes of the two trees.
2. If they are identical, we recursively check the left and right subtrees of both trees.
3. If the values or structure of any of the nodes don’t match between the two trees, we return `false`.

The recursive comparison ensures that all corresponding nodes in both trees are compared, and if any difference is found, the function will return `false` early. If all nodes match, we return `true`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. Function Definition

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
```

- The function `isSameTree` is part of the `Solution` class. It takes two arguments: `p` and `q`, which are pointers to the root nodes of the two binary trees that need to be compared.

#### 2. Base Case for Both Trees Being Null

```cpp
        if(p == NULL && q == NULL) return true;
```

- This is the **base case** where both trees are `NULL`. If both `p` and `q` are `NULL`, it means that both trees are empty, and therefore, they are considered the same. Thus, we return `true`.

#### 3. Handling One Tree Being Null

```cpp
        if(p == NULL || q == NULL) return false;
```

- If one of the trees is `NULL` while the other is not, the trees cannot be the same because one tree has nodes while the other doesn’t. Therefore, we return `false`.

#### 4. Comparing Values of Current Nodes

```cpp
        int ans = p->val == q->val;
```

- If both trees are non-empty at this point, we compare the values of the current nodes in both trees, `p->val` and `q->val`.
- The result of this comparison (`true` or `false`) is stored in the variable `ans`, where `true` is represented as `1` and `false` as `0`.

#### 5. Recursive Comparison of Left and Right Subtrees

```cpp
        ans &= isSameTree(p->left, q->left);
        ans &= isSameTree(p->right, q->right);
```

- After comparing the values of the current nodes, we proceed to recursively compare the left and right subtrees of both trees. 
- If the left subtrees of `p` and `q` are identical, `isSameTree(p->left, q->left)` will return `true` (or `1`), and the same logic applies for the right subtrees.
- The `&=` operator ensures that if any of the comparisons return `false` (or `0`), the overall result will be `false`. This allows us to short-circuit and return `false` if any mismatch is found at any level of recursion.

#### 6. Return the Final Result

```cpp
        return ans;
    }
};
```

- The final result, stored in the variable `ans`, is returned. This result will be `true` if both trees are identical, and `false` otherwise.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the larger of the two trees. In the worst case, the algorithm needs to visit every node in both trees to perform the comparison. Therefore, the time complexity is proportional to the total number of nodes in the trees.

#### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the trees. This is due to the recursive calls made during the in-order traversal of the trees. In the worst case (i.e., the tree is unbalanced), the recursion stack can grow to the height of the tree, which could be equal to the number of nodes, resulting in a space complexity of **O(n)**. However, for balanced trees, the height `h` would be **O(log n)**, leading to a space complexity of **O(log n)**.

### Conclusion

The algorithm efficiently compares two binary trees by performing a **recursive in-order traversal** to compare their structure and node values. The solution uses a simple yet effective approach that ensures all corresponding nodes are checked for equality, and the algorithm terminates early if a mismatch is detected. With a time complexity of **O(n)** and a space complexity of **O(h)**, this approach is optimal for solving the problem of determining whether two binary trees are identical.
