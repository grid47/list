### Problem Statement
You are given a list of intervals, and you need to find the smallest set of integers such that each interval contains at least two integers from this set. Your goal is to return the size of this smallest set.

### Approach
1. **Sorting Intervals**:
   - First, sort the intervals based on their ending values. If two intervals have the same ending value, sort them by their starting values in descending order. This ensures that when processing the intervals, we can easily check which integers are needed to satisfy the condition of having at least two integers in each interval.

2. **Greedy Selection**:
   - Use two variables, `fst` and `scd`, to track the last two selected integers. Initialize them to -1, indicating no integers have been selected yet.
   - Iterate through each interval, checking if the current interval already contains both selected integers.
   - If both integers are present, continue to the next interval.
   - If at least one integer is missing:
     - Increment the answer count accordingly (either add one more integer if one is missing or two integers if both are missing).
     - Update the selected integers based on the current interval's end.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to calculate the size of the intersection.

- **Method**:
  - `int intersectionSizeTwo(vector<vector<int>>& nums)`: This method performs the main logic of sorting the intervals and calculating the required size.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals, due to sorting.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the algorithm only uses a fixed amount of extra space for variables.
