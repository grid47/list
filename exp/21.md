### Problem Statement
Given two sorted linked lists `l1` and `l2`, merge them into a single sorted linked list. The merged list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

### Approach
1. **Base Cases**: Check if either list is empty:
   - If `l1` is `NULL`, return `l2`.
   - If `l2` is `NULL`, return `l1`.
2. **Recursive Comparison**: Compare the values of the nodes:
   - If the value of `l1`'s node is less than `l2`'s node, set `l1->next` to the result of merging the rest of `l1` and all of `l2`. Return `l1`.
   - Otherwise, set `l2->next` to the result of merging all of `l1` and the rest of `l2`. Return `l2`.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `mergeTwoLists` that takes two pointers `l1` and `l2` as input.
2. **Base Case Handling**:
   - If `l1` is `NULL`, return `l2`.
   - If `l2` is `NULL`, return `l1`.
3. **Recursive Logic**:
   - Compare the values at the heads of `l1` and `l2`.
   - Recursively merge the next nodes and link them appropriately based on the comparison.
4. **Return the Head of the Merged List**: Finally, return the node that starts the merged list.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N + M)\), where \(N\) and \(M\) are the lengths of the two lists. Every node from both lists is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(N + M)\) for the recursive call stack in the worst case (if both lists are merged completely).
