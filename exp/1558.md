# Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to find the minimum number of operations required to reduce all elements of an integer array `nums` to zero. The operations allowed are:
1. Subtracting 1 from an element (if it is odd).
2. Dividing an element by 2 (if it is greater than zero).

Given these operations, the challenge is to determine the fewest steps needed to transform all numbers in the array to zero.

# Approach

The approach used in the provided code involves a systematic reduction of the numbers in the array. The strategy can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start by setting a counter `cnt` to zero, which will keep track of the number of operations performed. Also, keep a variable `zeros` to count how many elements in the array are zero.

2. **Outer Loop**: The main loop continues until all elements in the array are reduced to zero. The condition `zeros != n` checks whether the count of zeros is less than the size of the array `n`.

3. **Subtracting Odd Numbers**: Within this loop, we iterate through the array to check each element. If an element is odd (checked using the bitwise AND operator `&`), we subtract 1 from it, and increment the counter `cnt`.

4. **Resetting Zero Count**: After processing odd elements, we reset the `zeros` count to zero and prepare for the next step.

5. **Dividing Even Numbers**: We then iterate through the array again. For each element, if it is greater than zero and the `ch` flag is true, we increment the counter `cnt` because this indicates we will be making a division operation. We then divide the element by 2.

6. **Counting Zeros Again**: After division, we check if any element has reached zero. If it has, we increment the `zeros` counter.

7. **Loop Continuation**: The outer loop continues until all elements in the array are zero.

8. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the value of `cnt`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to reduce all elements to zero.

# Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

Letâ€™s break down the code into key sections:

- **Header and Class Declaration**:
    ```cpp
    class Solution {
    public:
    ```

- **Function Definition**:
    The function `minOperations` takes a vector of integers `nums` as its parameter.

    ```cpp
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    ```

- **Variable Initialization**:
    Initialize `cnt`, `n`, and `zeros`.

    ```cpp
    int cnt = 0;
    int n = nums.size();
    int zeros = 0;
    ```

- **Outer Loop**:
    This loop continues until all elements are zero.

    ```cpp
    while(zeros != n) {
    ```

- **Odd Number Handling**:
    Iterate through the array, and for each odd number, subtract 1 and increment the counter.

    ```cpp
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(nums[i] & 1) cnt++, nums[i]--;
    }
    ```

- **Zero Count Reset and Division Check**:
    Reset the zero counter and check for divisions.

    ```cpp
    zeros = 0;
    int ch = true;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(nums[i] > 0 && ch) cnt++, ch = false;
        nums[i] /= 2;
        if(nums[i] == 0) zeros++;
    }
    ```

- **Final Return Statement**:
    Return the count of operations.

    ```cpp
    return cnt;
    }
    ```

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this approach is `O(log(max_num) * n)`, where `max_num` is the maximum value in the input array `nums`. The `log(max_num)` factor arises from the fact that the maximum number of divisions (by 2) we can perform on a number is proportional to its logarithm base 2. Each iteration of the outer loop processes all `n` elements of the array, leading to the overall complexity.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are using a fixed amount of extra space for variables (`cnt`, `zeros`, `n`), regardless of the size of the input array.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the `minOperations` function efficiently determines the minimum number of operations required to reduce all elements of the array `nums` to zero by leveraging a combination of subtraction and division. This methodical approach ensures that both odd and even numbers are handled appropriately within a loop, providing a clear and efficient solution to the problem. The resulting implementation showcases the balance between simplicity and efficiency in algorithm design, making it a valuable tool for similar numerical problems.

By understanding this solution, developers can enhance their skills in working with arrays and applying bitwise operations, as well as optimizing algorithms for minimum operation tasks. Whether applied in competitive programming or practical software development, this approach can serve as a reference point for tackling similar challenges.
