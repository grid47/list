### Problem Statement

The task is to determine whether a given integer `n` is a power of two. A power of two is a number that can be expressed as \( 2^k \) where \( k \) is a non-negative integer. For example, the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on are powers of two. The challenge is to efficiently check if a given integer `n` satisfies this condition.

### Approach

To check whether a given number is a power of two, we can use a simple and efficient approach based on the properties of binary numbers. The binary representation of powers of two has a very distinctive feature: for a number that is a power of two, there is exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation. For instance:
- \( 1 \) in binary is `0001`
- \( 2 \) in binary is `0010`
- \( 4 \) in binary is `0100`
- \( 8 \) in binary is `1000`

If we subtract 1 from any of these numbers, all the bits to the right of the leftmost 1 bit (including the leftmost 1 bit) become 1. For example:
- \( 4 - 1 = 3 \), which is `0011` in binary.
- Performing a bitwise AND operation between `4` (binary `0100`) and `3` (binary `0011`) results in `0000`.

Thus, if a number `n` is a power of two, the result of the bitwise AND operation `n & (n - 1)` should be 0. This property allows us to efficiently check if a number is a power of two.

The steps of the solution are:
1. Check if the number `n` is greater than zero.
2. Apply the bitwise AND operation between `n` and `n - 1`.
3. If the result is 0, the number is a power of two. Otherwise, it is not.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
```
- The function `isPowerOfTwo` is defined to accept an integer `n` and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a power of two.
  
```cpp
        if(n <= 0) return false;
```
- First, we check if the number `n` is less than or equal to zero. If `n` is less than or equal to zero, it cannot be a power of two because powers of two are always positive integers. So, we immediately return `false` for any non-positive number.

```cpp
        return !(n & (n - 1));
```
- The key step in the solution is the bitwise operation `n & (n - 1)`. This operation clears the rightmost set bit of `n`. If `n` is a power of two, this operation will result in zero. 
- The `!` operator is used to negate the result. If the result is `0`, meaning `n` is a power of two, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Thus, the function checks whether the bitwise AND of `n` and `n - 1` is zero, indicating that `n` is a power of two.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - The bitwise operations used in the function (`n & (n - 1)`) are constant-time operations. Checking whether a number is a power of two requires only a single comparison and a single bitwise operation, making this solution very efficient.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - The algorithm uses only a constant amount of space for the integer variable `n`. There are no additional data structures or recursive calls, so the space complexity is constant.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently checks if a given integer is a power of two using a simple bitwise operation. The key observation is that powers of two have a unique property in their binary representation: they have exactly one bit set to 1. The bitwise operation `n & (n - 1)` takes advantage of this property to determine if `n` is a power of two in constant time.

#### Key Highlights:
- **Efficient Solution**: The algorithm runs in constant time `O(1)` due to the direct use of bitwise operations, making it highly efficient even for large integers.
- **Simple Logic**: The solution relies on a simple bitwise trick that is both easy to understand and execute.
- **Constant Space**: The algorithm uses a fixed amount of space, independent of the size of the input.
  
#### When to Use:
This solution is ideal for problems that require checking powers of two, such as in scenarios involving binary manipulation, network protocols, or memory management tasks. The constant-time and constant-space complexity make this method suitable for applications that need fast checks on large datasets or real-time systems.

#### Advantages of Bitwise Approach:
- **Speed**: Bitwise operations are typically faster than arithmetic operations because they work directly on the bits of numbers.
- **Compactness**: This solution is very compact and easy to implement, with minimal overhead.

By leveraging the properties of binary numbers, this solution provides a quick and reliable way to determine if a number is a power of two, making it ideal for use in many competitive programming and real-world scenarios.
