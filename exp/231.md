### Problem Statement
Determine if a given integer \( n \) is a power of two.

### Approach
- **Bit Manipulation**: A number \( n \) is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set in its binary representation. This can be efficiently checked using the expression `!(n & (n - 1))`.
  - **Explanation**:
    - If \( n \) is a power of two, subtracting 1 from it will flip all bits after the only set bit, including the set bit itself.
    - The bitwise AND operation between \( n \) and \( n - 1 \) will result in zero if \( n \) is a power of two.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function `isPowerOfTwo(int n)`**:
  - Check if \( n \) is less than or equal to zero. If so, return `false` since powers of two are positive.
  - Return the result of `!(n & (n - 1))`, which will be `true` if \( n \) is a power of two and `false` otherwise.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(1) \), as it performs a constant-time operation.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \), as it uses a fixed amount of space for the computation.
