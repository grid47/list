### Problem Statement
Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, find the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` into `word2`. The allowed operations are insertions, deletions, and substitutions.

### Approach
1. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**:
   - The problem can be reduced to finding the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) of the two strings. The LCS helps determine how many characters are already in common between the two strings.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Create a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of LCS of the substrings `word1[0...i-1]` and `word2[0...j-1]`.
   - Initialize the first row and column to zero since the LCS of an empty string with any string is zero.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Iterate through each character of `word1` and `word2`. If characters match, increment the LCS count from the previous indices. If they don't match, take the maximum value from either ignoring the current character of `word1` or `word2`.

4. **Calculate Minimum Distance**:
   - The minimum operations required to convert `word1` to `word2` can be computed using the formula:
     \[
     \text{minDistance} = (\text{length of word1}) + (\text{length of word2}) - 2 \times (\text{LCS length})
     \]

### Code Walk-through
- The function initializes a DP table and fills it based on matches between characters of the two words.
- Finally, it computes and returns the minimum number of operations using the calculated LCS length.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, respectively, due to the nested loops filling the DP table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n), for storing the DP table.
