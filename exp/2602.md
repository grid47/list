### Problem Statement

The problem involves calculating the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements of an array `nums` greater than or equal to the values specified in an array `q`. Each operation consists of incrementing or decrementing the values in the `nums` array to meet the conditions specified in `q`. The task is to compute the number of operations for each query efficiently.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to efficiently compute how many operations are required for each query in the array `q` to modify the array `nums` such that all elements of `nums` are greater than or equal to the query value. The core challenge is efficiently determining how to make all elements of `nums` meet the specified threshold and calculating the operations needed.

The steps in the approach are as follows:

1. **Sorting the Array**: We first sort the array `nums`. Sorting helps us efficiently find the elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to each query value using binary search. Sorting ensures that we can process the array efficiently with the help of the `lower_bound` function.

2. **Prefix Sum Array**: We compute a prefix sum array `pre`, where `pre[i]` stores the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the sorted `nums` array. This helps us quickly compute the sum of elements less than or equal to a query value and those greater than the query value.

3. **Binary Search**: For each query value `q[i]`, we use the `lower_bound` function to find the first index in `nums` where the value is greater than or equal to `q[i]`. This binary search helps us efficiently partition the array into two sections: one where elements are smaller than `q[i]`, and the other where elements are greater than or equal to `q[i]`.

4. **Calculating Operations**: For each query:
   - If all elements of `nums` are smaller than `q[i]`, we calculate the operations by multiplying `q[i]` with the total number of elements in `nums` and subtracting the sum of all elements.
   - If there are elements greater than or equal to `q[i]`, we calculate the operations required for each partition using the prefix sum array. The operations for the left section (smaller elements) involve incrementing them to `q[i]`, and the operations for the right section (larger elements) involve decrementing them to `q[i]`.

5. **Return the Results**: After processing each query, we return the results in the form of an array.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. **Sorting the Array**:
   ```cpp
   sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
   ```
   - The first step is to sort the array `nums`. Sorting helps us later apply binary search efficiently and ensures we can compute the results for each query in an optimized manner.

#### 2. **Initializing Prefix Sum Array**:
   ```cpp
   vector<long long> pre(n, 0);
   pre[0] = nums[0];
   for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
       pre[i] = pre[i - 1] + nums[i];
   ```
   - We create a prefix sum array `pre` of size `n`. This array stores the cumulative sum of the sorted elements of `nums`. This allows us to efficiently compute the sum of elements less than or equal to a query value and those greater than the query value.

#### 3. **Processing Each Query**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < q.size(); i++) {
       auto it = lower_bound(nums.begin(), nums.end(), q[i]);
   ```
   - We iterate over each query in the array `q`. For each query `q[i]`, we use the `lower_bound` function to find the position of the first element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to `q[i]`. This helps us partition the array into elements smaller than `q[i]` and those that are greater than or equal to it.

#### 4. **Calculating the Operations**:
   ```cpp
   if(it == nums.end()) {
       ans[i] = (long long)q[i] * n - pre[n - 1];
   } else {
       int idx = it - nums.begin();
       long long right = pre[n - 1] - ((idx > 0) ? pre[idx - 1] : 0);
       long long left = idx > 0 ? pre[idx - 1] : 0;
       ans[i] = (long long)q[i] * idx - (long long)left + (long long)right - (long long)q[i] * ((long long)n - idx);
   }
   ```
   - If the `lower_bound` returns `nums.end()`, it means all elements in `nums` are smaller than the query value. In this case, we compute the operations as the difference between `q[i]` multiplied by the number of elements in `nums` and the sum of all elements in `nums`.
   - If `lower_bound` finds a position within `nums`, we compute the operations for both the left section (smaller elements) and the right section (larger elements). The left section needs to be incremented to meet `q[i]`, and the right section needs to be decremented. We calculate the total operations as the difference between `q[i]` and the elements in `nums`.

#### 5. **Returning the Results**:
   ```cpp
   return ans;
   ```
   - After processing all the queries, we return the results array `ans`, which contains the minimum number of operations required for each query in `q`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Sorting the array `nums` takes \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the size of `nums`.
  - For each query, finding the position using `lower_bound` takes \(O(\log n)\). Since there are `m` queries, processing all queries takes \(O(m \log n)\).
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n + m \log n)\), where `n` is the size of `nums` and `m` is the size of `q`.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(n + m)\), as we store the prefix sum array `pre` of size `n` and the result array `ans` of size `m`.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements in `nums` greater than or equal to the query values in `q`. By sorting `nums` and using binary search, we ensure that each query is processed in logarithmic time with respect to the size of `nums`. The use of a prefix sum array further optimizes the calculation of required operations. The overall time complexity of \(O(n \log n + m \log n)\) ensures that the solution is efficient for large input sizes.
