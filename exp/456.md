### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, a 132 pattern is a subsequence of three integers `nums[i]`, `nums[j]`, `nums[k]` such that `i < j < k` and `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j]`. Your task is to determine if there exists a 132 pattern in the given array.

### Approach
1. **Use a Stack**:
   - We will utilize a stack to keep track of potential candidates for the middle element (the "3" in the 132 pattern).

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - Iterate through the array from the end to the beginning. This allows us to effectively manage the elements in a way that facilitates finding a "1" that is less than a "3" that is less than a "2".

3. **Maintain a Variable**:
   - Keep a variable `prv` to store the value of "2" (the top element of the stack) from the previous iteration, ensuring it is the largest possible value encountered that could serve as "2" in the pattern.

4. **Check for Pattern**:
   - For each element `nums[i]`, check if it is less than `prv`. If it is, a valid 132 pattern is found, and we can return `true`.
   - While the stack is not empty and `nums[i]` is greater than the top of the stack, update `prv` to the top of the stack and pop the stack.

5. **Push Current Element**:
   - Push the current element `nums[i]` onto the stack.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `prv` to `INT_MIN` and create an empty stack.

2. **Loop Through Elements**:
   - Start from the last index of `nums` and move backwards.
   - For each element, check if it's less than `prv`. If so, return `true`.
   - Update `prv` as needed and push the current element onto the stack.

3. **Final Result**:
   - If no pattern is found by the end of the loop, return `false`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in `nums`, since each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) in the worst case for the stack, but on average, it can be much smaller.
