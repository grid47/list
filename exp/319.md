### Problem Statement
You have `n` bulbs, initially turned off. A person toggles the state of the bulbs (turning them on if they are off and vice versa) in the following manner:
- On the first round, they toggle every bulb.
- On the second round, they toggle every second bulb.
- On the third round, they toggle every third bulb, and so on until the `n`-th round.

The goal is to determine how many bulbs are on after `n` rounds.

### Approach
The key observation is that a bulb ends up being toggled (switched) for each of its divisors. For example:
- Bulb 12 is toggled on rounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

A bulb will remain on if it is toggled an odd number of times. This occurs only for bulbs that are perfect squares because perfect squares have an odd number of divisors (one of the divisors is repeated).

For instance:
- \(1 = 1^2\) has 1 divisor.
- \(4 = 2^2\) has 3 divisors (1, 2, 4).
- \(9 = 3^2\) has 3 divisors (1, 3, 9).

Thus, the number of bulbs that remain on corresponds to the number of perfect squares less than or equal to `n`. This is equal to the largest integer \(k\) such that \(k^2 \leq n\), which is the integer part of the square root of `n`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Input**: An integer `n` representing the number of bulbs.
- **Output**: An integer representing the number of bulbs that are on after all rounds.

1. Return the integer part of the square root of `n`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(1)\) because calculating the square root is a constant-time operation.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) since no additional data structures are used.
