### Problem Statement
The Job Scheduling problem requires finding the maximum profit that can be obtained by scheduling a series of jobs, where each job has a start time, end time, and profit associated with it. The key constraint is that no two jobs can overlap in their execution. The objective is to determine the maximum profit that can be earned by selecting jobs such that their execution times do not conflict.

### Approach
To solve the Job Scheduling problem, we can utilize a combination of dynamic programming and binary search. The approach is broken down into the following steps:

1. **Job Representation**: Represent each job using a structured format that includes its start time, end time, and profit.

2. **Sorting**: Sort the jobs based on their end times to facilitate easier management of job scheduling.

3. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum profit:
   - Utilize a recursive function with memoization to avoid recalculating results for previously solved subproblems.
   - For each job, decide whether to include it in the scheduling or to skip it, based on the maximum profit achievable.

4. **Binary Search**: When deciding to include a job, use binary search to find the next job that starts after the current job ends. This ensures that jobs are non-overlapping.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int n;
    vector<vector<int>> item;
    vector<int> mem;
```
- **Lines 1-4**: We define the `Solution` class and declare the necessary member variables. `n` represents the number of jobs, `item` holds the details of each job, and `mem` is a memoization vector for dynamic programming.

```cpp
    int bs(int end, int idx) {
        int ans = item.size();
        int l = idx, r = item.size() - 1;
```
- **Line 5**: We define a binary search function `bs` that takes the `end` time of a job and the current index `idx` as parameters.

```cpp
        while(l <= r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l + 1) / 2;
            if(item[mid][0] >= end) {
                ans = mid;
                r = mid - 1;
            } else l = mid + 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```
- **Lines 6-14**: This while loop implements binary search to find the index of the first job that starts after the current job ends. If a jobâ€™s start time is greater than or equal to the `end`, we update `ans` and narrow down the search range.

```cpp
    int dp(int idx) {
        if(idx == item.size()) return 0;
```
- **Line 15**: We define the dynamic programming function `dp`, which calculates the maximum profit starting from job index `idx`. If `idx` reaches the size of the `item`, it means there are no more jobs to consider, and we return 0.

```cpp
        if(mem[idx] != -1) return mem[idx];
```
- **Line 16**: This line checks if the maximum profit for the job at index `idx` has already been calculated and stored in `mem`. If it has, we return the stored value to avoid redundant calculations.

```cpp
        int ans = dp(idx + 1);
```
- **Line 17**: We initialize `ans` with the result of `dp(idx + 1)`, which represents skipping the current job and calculating the profit from the next job.

```cpp
        int nxt = bs(item[idx][1], idx + 1);
        ans = max(ans, dp(nxt) + item[idx][2]);
```
- **Lines 18-20**: We perform a binary search to find the next job (`nxt`) that can be scheduled after the current job's end time. We then update `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the profit obtained by including the current job (`item[idx][2]`) plus the profit of scheduling the next job.

```cpp
        return mem[idx] = ans;
    }
```
- **Lines 21-23**: Finally, we store the calculated maximum profit in `mem[idx]` and return it.

```cpp
    int jobScheduling(vector<int>& st, vector<int>& et, vector<int>& profit) {
        n = st.size();
        item.resize(n);
        mem.resize(n, -1);
```
- **Lines 24-27**: We define the main function `jobScheduling`, which takes three vectors: `st` (start times), `et` (end times), and `profit`. We initialize `n` with the number of jobs, resize the `item` vector to hold job details, and initialize the `mem` vector to store memoized results.

```cpp
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            item[i] = vector<int>{st[i], et[i], profit[i]};
```
- **Lines 28-30**: We populate the `item` vector with job details by creating a vector for each job that includes its start time, end time, and profit.

```cpp
        sort(item.begin(), item.end());
```
- **Line 31**: We sort the `item` vector based on the end times of the jobs. This is crucial for the correct implementation of the scheduling logic.

```cpp
        return dp(0);        
    }
};
```
- **Lines 32-34**: Finally, we invoke the `dp` function starting from the first job (index 0) and return the result.

### Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity of the solution is \( O(n \log n) \). This is due to the sorting step, which takes \( O(n \log n) \), and the dynamic programming approach, where each job may be processed once with binary search.

2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of jobs. This accounts for the storage of the `item` vector and the `mem` memoization vector.

### Conclusion
The `jobScheduling` function effectively calculates the maximum profit from scheduling jobs using a combination of dynamic programming and binary search. By representing jobs with their respective start times, end times, and profits, and using a sorted approach to manage job conflicts, this solution is efficient and elegant. The use of memoization ensures that we avoid redundant calculations, making the algorithm suitable for larger datasets. Overall, this solution provides a robust method for tackling the Job Scheduling problem, demonstrating the power of dynamic programming and binary search in optimizing solutions.
