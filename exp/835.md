### Problem Statement
The goal is to find the largest overlap between two binary matrices, `img1` and `img2`, where overlap is defined as the number of `1`s that align when one image is translated over the other.

### Approach
1. **Identify Positions of `1`s**:
   - Extract the coordinates of all `1`s from both `img1` and `img2`. Each position is represented as a single integer calculated from its row and column indices.

2. **Calculate Offsets**:
   - For each pair of positions from `img1` and `img2`, compute the offset needed to align them. The offset can be calculated as the difference between the positions of `1`s in `img1` and `img2`.

3. **Count Overlaps**:
   - Use a hash map to count how many times each offset occurs. The more frequent an offset, the more overlap it represents when translating `img1` over `img2`.

4. **Find Maximum Overlap**:
   - The maximum value in the hash map will give the largest overlap.

### Code Walk-through
- Loop through both matrices to collect positions of `1`s.
- Calculate the difference for every pair of positions between the two images, storing the results in a hash map.
- Iterate through the hash map to find the maximum overlap.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in each matrix. This arises from comparing every `1` in `img1` with every `1` in `img2`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the positions of `1`s and the counts in the hash map.
