### Problem Statement
Implement the `StockSpanner` class that calculates the span of stock prices for a series of daily stock prices. The span for a stock price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (including today) the stock price was less than or equal to today's price.

### Class Definition
- **Class**: `StockSpanner`
  - **Constructor**: `StockSpanner()`
    - Initializes an empty stack to store stock prices and their spans.
  - **Method**: `int next(int price)`
    - Takes an integer `price` representing the stock price for the day.
    - Returns the span of stock prices for that day.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a stack `cp` to store pairs of stock prices and their respective spans.

2. **Calculating Span**:
   - Initialize the span (`res`) to 1 for the current day's price.
   - While the stack is not empty and the price at the top of the stack is less than or equal to the current price:
     - Add the span of the stock price at the top of the stack to `res` and pop the stack.
   - After processing, push the current price along with its calculated span onto the stack.
   - Return the calculated span.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) on average for each `next` call since each price is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of stock prices stored in the stack.
