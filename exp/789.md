### Problem Statement
Given the positions of ghosts and your target position, determine if you can reach your target position before any ghost does. You can move one unit per turn, and ghosts move at the same speed.

### Approach
1. **Calculate Your Distance**:
   - Compute the Manhattan distance from your current position (assumed to be `(0, 0)`) to the target position `t`, which is given by:
     \[
     d = |t[0]| + |t[1]|
     \]
   - This represents the total number of steps you need to reach the target.

2. **Check Ghost Distances**:
   - For each ghost's position `it`, calculate its distance to the target using the formula:
     \[
     \text{distance}_{\text{ghost}} = |it[0] - t[0]| + |it[1] - t[1]|
     \]
   - If the ghost's distance to the target is less than or equal to your distance `d`, you cannot reach the target before that ghost, so return `false`.

3. **Return Result**:
   - If none of the ghosts can reach the target before you, return `true`.

### Code Walk-through
- **Class**:
  - `class Solution`: Contains the method to determine if you can escape from the ghosts.
    - `bool escapeGhosts(vector<vector<int>>& gs, vector<int>& t)`: Main function to compute the escape possibility.
      - **Parameters**:
        - `gs`: A 2D vector representing the positions of the ghosts.
        - `t`: A vector representing your target position.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(g), where \( g \) is the number of ghosts, since we check the distance for each ghost.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a fixed number of integer variables.
