### Problem Statement

The problem requires us to return a deck of cards in a specific order. Initially, the deck is shuffled, and the goal is to simulate a process where the cards are revealed and rearranged in a defined pattern. The task is to reveal the cards in increasing order but follow a specific sequence of operations. Here's how the card revelation process works:

1. Start with a shuffled deck of `n` cards.
2. Sort the cards in increasing order.
3. The first card is revealed.
4. The next card is placed at the bottom of the deck.
5. Repeat the above two steps until all the cards are revealed.

The output should be the sequence of cards in the order they were revealed after performing this process.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can break down the problem into the following steps:

1. **Sorting the Deck**: Since the cards need to be revealed in increasing order, we begin by sorting the deck in ascending order.
   
2. **Simulating the Revealing Process**:
   - We use a queue to simulate the positions of the cards.
   - We initially push all card indices into the queue.
   - For each card in the sorted deck, we place the card at the front of the queue (which corresponds to the current revealed position) and then move the next card to the bottom of the queue.
   - This ensures that the revealed cards are arranged in the correct order while maintaining the order of the remaining cards.

3. **Result Storage**:
   - We store the cards in their final revealed order in a result array, where each index represents the position in the queue where the card is revealed.
   
4. **Queue Manipulation**:
   - We continue processing the cards until all cards have been revealed.
   
### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Sorting the Deck**:
   ```cpp
   sort(deck.begin(), deck.end());
   int n = deck.size();
   ```
   - First, we sort the deck in increasing order so that the smallest card is revealed first.

2. **Initializing Variables**:
   ```cpp
   queue<int> q;
   vector<int> res(n, 0);
   ```
   - We initialize a queue `q` to simulate the process of revealing cards.
   - `res` is a vector that will store the final order of cards after the revealing process.

3. **Pushing Initial Positions into Queue**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
       q.push(i);
   ```
   - We push all indices from 0 to `n-1` into the queue to represent the positions of the cards in the deck.

4. **Simulating the Revealing Process**:
   ```cpp
   for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       res[q.front()] = deck[i];
       q.pop();
       if(!q.empty()) {
           q.push(q.front());
           q.pop();                
       }
   }
   ```
   - In the main loop, we reveal the current card (`deck[i]`) by placing it in the position given by `q.front()`. This corresponds to the card index in the queue.
   - After revealing a card, we remove it from the front of the queue (`q.pop()`).
   - If there are still cards left in the queue, we simulate the process of moving the next card to the bottom by pushing the front card to the back of the queue (`q.push(q.front())`) and then popping it from the front.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```
   - After processing all cards, the `res` array contains the final sequence of revealed cards.

### Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Sorting the deck takes `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of cards in the deck.
   - The loop for simulating the revealing process runs `n` times, and each operation inside the loop involves either a `pop` or a `push` operation on the queue. Each of these operations takes constant time, so the total time complexity for this part is `O(n)`.
   - Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is `O(n log n)`.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - We use a queue to store `n` indices, and a result array `res` of size `n` to store the final card sequence. Thus, the space complexity is `O(n)`.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently simulates the process of revealing cards in increasing order while respecting the specific sequence of operations required by the problem. By using a queue to manage the card positions and sorting the deck beforehand, we ensure that the cards are revealed in the correct order. The time complexity of `O(n log n)` makes this approach suitable for larger inputs, and the space complexity of `O(n)` ensures that the solution is memory efficient. The problem's solution is optimal in both time and space, making it an excellent approach to solving this problem.
