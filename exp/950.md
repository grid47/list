### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers representing a deck of cards. Each integer represents the value of a card. The goal is to rearrange the deck such that when the cards are revealed in a specific order, they appear in increasing order.

### Approach
1. **Sorting the Deck**:
   - Start by sorting the input deck in ascending order. This ensures that we can place the cards in increasing order when revealed.

2. **Using a Queue**:
   - Initialize a queue to keep track of the indices of the cards. This will help manage the order in which cards are revealed.
   - Fill the queue with indices from `0` to `n-1`, where `n` is the number of cards.

3. **Revealing Cards**:
   - For each card in the sorted deck:
     - Place the current card in the result array at the index specified by the front of the queue.
     - Remove that index from the queue.
     - If there are still indices left in the queue, move the next index to the back of the queue to simulate the "revealing" and "placing at the back" operations.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - Once all cards are placed, return the result array.

### Code Walk-through
- The function begins by sorting the `deck`.
- It uses a queue to maintain the order of indices and fills the result array by iterating through the sorted deck.
- Finally, it returns the result array with the cards arranged as required.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting operation.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the queue and result vector.
