### Problem Statement
Given a binary search tree (BST), find all the modes (the most frequently occurred values) in the BST. If the tree is empty, return an empty array.

### Approach
1. **Inorder Traversal**:
   - Perform an inorder traversal of the tree, which retrieves the values in sorted order due to the properties of a BST.

2. **Tracking Frequencies**:
   - Use variables to track the frequency of the current value (`currFreq`), the maximum frequency observed (`maxFreq`), and the last value processed (`precursor`).

3. **Updating Modes**:
   - During traversal, update the frequency count based on whether the current value is the same as the precursor. If a new maximum frequency is found, reset the result vector and update `maxFreq`. If the current frequency equals `maxFreq`, append the value to the result.

4. **Return Results**:
   - After completing the traversal, return the result vector containing all modes.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Class Definition**:
   - The `Solution` class contains the method `findMode`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `maxFreq` and `currFreq` are initialized to track frequencies, while `precursor` stores the last value processed.

3. **Main Method**:
   - `findMode` initiates the traversal by calling `inorderTraversal` and returns the results.

4. **Traversal Method**:
   - The `inorderTraversal` function recursively visits each node, updating frequencies and managing the result vector based on the frequency conditions.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, since each node is visited once during the traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the size of the result vector in the worst case (if all values are modes), and O(h) for the recursion stack, where h is the height of the tree.
