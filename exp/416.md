### Problem Statement
Given a non-empty array `nums` containing positive integers, determine if it can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal.

### Approach
1. **Calculate Total Sum**: First, compute the total sum of the elements in `nums`. If the total sum is odd, itâ€™s impossible to split it into two equal subsets, so return `false`.
2. **Target Sum**: If the total sum is even, set the target sum for each subset to `sum / 2`.
3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Use a recursive function `dp(idx, sum)` to check if a subset can be formed from the first `idx` elements that adds up to `sum`. Utilize memoization to store previously computed results:
   - If the current index equals the size of `nums`, check if the sum is zero.
   - If the result for the current `idx` and `sum` is already computed, return it.
4. **Recursive Calls**:
   - Check whether the current element can be included in the subset or not:
     - Call `dp(idx + 1, sum)` to explore the case where the current element is excluded.
     - If the current element can be included (i.e., `sum >= nums[idx]`), call `dp(idx + 1, sum - nums[idx])`.
5. **Store Result**: Save the result in the memoization table and return it.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Input Initialization**: Store the input `nums` into a member variable and calculate the total sum.
2. **Odd Sum Check**: Immediately return `false` if the total sum is odd.
3. **Memoization Array**: Initialize the memoization array `memo` with `-1` to indicate uncomputed states.
4. **Recursion**: Start the recursive function from the first index and the target sum.
5. **Return Result**: The final result of the function indicates whether the partitioning is possible.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * sum), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums` and `sum` is the target sum. The memoization table has `n` rows and `sum + 1` columns.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * sum) for the memoization table, plus O(n) for the recursion stack in the worst case.
