### Problem Statement
Given a `stamp` and a `target` string, the goal is to find the minimum sequence of moves to convert `target` into a string composed entirely of `'*'` characters by replacing segments of `target` with the `stamp`. Each move consists of placing the `stamp` over the `target` such that it matches a segment, replacing that segment with `'*'`. The function should return the sequence of starting indices for each stamping operation, or an empty array if it's not possible.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a result vector `res` to store the positions of the stamping operations.
   - Initialize `turns` and `net` to track the number of characters stamped in each iteration and the total characters stamped, respectively.

2. **Iterative Stamping Process**:
   - Use a while loop to continue stamping until no more stamps can be applied (`turns` remains 0).
   - For each possible size of the stamp from its full size down to 1:
     - Check all possible starting positions in the `stamp` to create a pattern (`key`) that consists of `'*'` and a substring of the `stamp`.
     - Search for the `key` in the `target` string.
     - When found, replace that segment in `target` with `'*'`, increment the `turns`, and store the starting position in `res`.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, check if the total number of characters replaced (`net`) equals the length of the `target`.
   - If so, return the positions in reverse order; otherwise, return an empty vector.

### Code Walk-through
- The main function `movesToStamp` implements the above logic using nested loops to explore all possible stamps and positions.
- The key transformation is performed using `std::string::find` and `std::fill` to replace segments in the target.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m^2) where `n` is the length of the target string and `m` is the length of the stamp string. The complexity arises from iterating through possible stamp sizes and positions and searching within the target.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the result vector and additional temporary variables.
