### Problem Statement

The problem asks to determine the sequence of moves required to transform a string `target` into a string of asterisks (`*`) using a given stamp string `stamp`. In each move, you can place the stamp on any part of the `target` where it matches or partially overlaps with the `target`. After applying the stamp, the characters in the target that overlap with the stamp are replaced with `*`. The goal is to return the sequence of indices where the stamp is applied, in the correct order, to convert the entire `target` into a string of asterisks. If it is impossible to do so, return an empty vector.

### Approach

This problem can be solved by simulating the stamping process iteratively and checking for every possible position where the stamp can fit. The idea is to find positions in `target` where the stamp can be applied and transform the target by replacing the matching section with `*`. The process continues until the entire target is transformed into a string of `*`. The approach involves:

1. **Greedy Simulation**: We simulate the stamping process by checking each possible position in `target` where the stamp can be applied. This involves checking for both partial and complete matches.
  
2. **String Matching with Wildcards**: To facilitate the matching, we use a wildcard character (`*`) to denote positions in the target that have already been stamped. During each iteration, we try to apply the stamp at positions where the stamp either completely or partially matches with the current state of the target (accounting for previously stamped characters).

3. **Tracking Changes**: Each time we find a valid position where the stamp can be applied, we update the target and record the position of the stamp application. We continue this process until the entire target becomes `*`. 

4. **Edge Case Handling**: If it is impossible to stamp the entire target using the given stamp, we return an empty vector. This is checked by ensuring that the number of turns taken to transform the target equals the length of the target.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Initial Setup**:
   ```cpp
   vector<int> res;
   int turns = -1, net = 0;
   ```
   - `res`: This vector stores the sequence of positions where the stamp is applied.
   - `turns`: This variable tracks the number of characters in `target` that were replaced in the current iteration.
   - `net`: This variable accumulates the total number of characters replaced across all iterations.

2. **Main Loop (Simulating the Stamping Process)**:
   ```cpp
   while(turns) {
       turns = 0;
       for(int sz = stamp.size(); sz > 0; sz--) {
           for(int i = 0; i <= stamp.size() - sz; i++) {
               string key = string(i, '*') + stamp.substr(i, sz) + string(stamp.size() - sz - i, '*');
               auto pos = target.find(key);
               while(pos != string::npos) {
                   res.push_back(pos);
                   turns += sz;
                   fill(target.begin() + pos, target.begin() + pos + stamp.size(), '*');
                   pos = target.find(key);
               }
           }
       }
       net += turns;
   }
   ```
   - The outer `while` loop continues as long as we find valid positions to apply the stamp.
   - The inner loops iterate over all possible sub-strings (`key`) that match part of the stamp. For each possible substring, we search for its occurrences in `target` using `find`.
   - If a match is found, we replace that section of `target` with `*` using `fill` and record the position where the stamp was applied.
   - The `turns` variable is incremented by the size of the matched substring, and `net` accumulates the total number of replacements.

3. **Reversing the Result**:
   ```cpp
   reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
   ```
   - The positions of the stamp applications are stored in reverse order. Since the final answer requires the order of applications to be from first to last, we reverse the `res` vector.

4. **Final Check**:
   ```cpp
   return net == target.size() ? res : vector<int>{};
   ```
   - After completing the process, we check if the total number of characters replaced (`net`) is equal to the length of `target`. If it is, we return the sequence of positions in `res`. If not, it means it is impossible to stamp the entire target, and we return an empty vector.

### Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of this approach is driven by the double loop structure. The outer `while` loop continues as long as changes are made to `target`. In the worst case, we may iterate over the entire target multiple times. For each iteration, the algorithm performs string matching and replacement, which takes O(n) time for each operation. 
   - Therefore, the time complexity is approximately O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the `target`. This is because in the worst case, we may need to check all substrings of the stamp and search for them in the target.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is dominated by the storage for the `res` vector and the `target` string itself. The `res` vector can hold up to `n` positions, and the `target` string can hold up to `n` characters. Thus, the space complexity is O(n).

### Conclusion

This solution uses a greedy approach to simulate the process of stamping characters on the target string. By checking all possible positions where the stamp can apply, and using string matching to track changes, we efficiently determine the sequence of moves needed to convert the target string into a string of asterisks. The solution ensures that the correct order of operations is returned, and handles the edge case where the target cannot be fully stamped. The approach leverages efficient string manipulation and ensures that the solution works within the constraints for larger inputs.
