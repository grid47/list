### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find the **maximum sum of two numbers** from a list such that the sum of the digits of the two numbers is the same. The goal is to return this maximum sum. If no such pair exists, the answer should be `-1`.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. **Iterate through the input array (`nums`)**: For each number, we need to calculate the sum of its digits.
2. **Store the maximum number for each sum of digits**: For each unique sum of digits, we track the largest number that has this sum.
3. **Update the maximum sum**: Whenever we find another number with the same sum of digits, we check if adding it to the previously stored number results in a higher sum than the current maximum.
4. **Return the maximum sum**: After iterating through all the numbers, return the maximum sum found. If no valid pair is found, return `-1`.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

#### 1. **Initialization**
```cpp
map<int, int> mp;
int ans = -1;
```
- **`map<int, int> mp;`**: This map will store the sum of digits as the key and the largest number corresponding to that sum as the value.
- **`int ans = -1;`**: This variable will store the maximum sum of any pair of numbers with the same sum of digits. If no valid pair is found, `ans` will remain `-1`.

#### 2. **Iterate Through Each Number**
```cpp
for(int x: nums) {
    int sum = 0;
    int tmp = x;
    while(tmp > 0) {
        sum += (tmp % 10);
        tmp /= 10;
    }
```
- **`for(int x: nums)`**: This loop iterates over each number `x` in the input array `nums`.
- **`int sum = 0;`**: This variable will store the sum of digits of the current number `x`.
- **`int tmp = x;`**: We use a temporary variable `tmp` to extract the digits of `x` without modifying `x` directly.
- **`while(tmp > 0)`**: This loop extracts digits from the number `tmp` one by one.
    - **`sum += (tmp % 10);`**: This adds the last digit of `tmp` to `sum`.
    - **`tmp /= 10;`**: This removes the last digit from `tmp` by dividing it by 10.

#### 3. **Check if Sum of Digits Exists in Map**
```cpp
if(mp.count(sum)) {
    ans = max(ans, x + mp[sum]);
    mp[sum] = max(x, mp[sum]);
} else {
    mp[sum] = x;
}
```
- **`if(mp.count(sum))`**: This checks if the sum of digits `sum` already exists as a key in the map `mp`.
    - **`ans = max(ans, x + mp[sum]);`**: If a number with the same sum of digits already exists in the map, we calculate the sum of the current number `x` and the previously stored number `mp[sum]` (which is the largest number with this sum of digits). We update `ans` with the maximum of the current `ans` and the new sum.
    - **`mp[sum] = max(x, mp[sum]);`**: After updating `ans`, we update the map to store the maximum of `x` and the existing value for `mp[sum]` (i.e., store the largest number with the sum of digits `sum`).
- **`else`**: If `sum` is not already a key in the map, we simply store `x` as the value for the key `sum` in the map `mp`.

#### 4. **Return the Result**
```cpp
return ans;
```
- After iterating through all the numbers in the array, we return the value of `ans`. If no valid pair was found, `ans` will remain `-1`.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n * d)**: The time complexity of this solution is **O(n * d)**, where:
  - **n** is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.
  - **d** is the number of digits in the largest number in the array.
- For each number, we compute the sum of its digits in **O(d)** time. Since the number of digits `d` is proportional to the logarithm of the number size, the time complexity becomes **O(n * log(max(nums)))**.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The space complexity is **O(n)** because, in the worst case, all numbers in the array could have unique sums of digits. The map `mp` stores at most `n` unique sums.

### Conclusion

This solution is efficient and works well even for large arrays. By calculating the sum of digits for each number and using a map to track the largest number for each sum, we can quickly find the maximum sum of two numbers with the same sum of digits. The solution runs in **O(n * log(max(nums)))** time, which is optimal for this type of problem. The space complexity is also **O(n)**, making this solution suitable for large inputs. If no valid pair of numbers is found, the solution correctly returns `-1`, ensuring that edge cases are handled.
