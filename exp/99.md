### Problem Statement
Two nodes in a binary search tree (BST) have been swapped by mistake, violating the BST property. This function identifies and corrects the swapped nodes to restore the BST.

### Approach
This solution uses **in-order traversal** to detect the swapped nodes:
1. **In-order Traversal**:
   - Perform an in-order traversal, which would normally visit nodes in increasing order for a valid BST.
   - During traversal, detect nodes that are out of order by comparing each node with the previous node (`prv`).
2. **Detect Swapped Nodes**:
   - If a node is smaller than the previous node, record the misplaced nodes:
     - **First misplaced node (`fst`)**: The first time we detect a violation, `prv` is recorded as `fst`.
     - **Second misplaced node (`scd`)**: Each subsequent violation records the current node as `scd`.
3. **Swap the Values**:
   - After identifying the two misplaced nodes (`fst` and `scd`), swap their values to restore the BST property.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialize Pointers**: Set `prv` (previous node), `fst` (first misplaced node), and `scd` (second misplaced node) to `NULL`.
2. **Recursive In-order Traversal** (`inorder` function):
   - Traverse to the leftmost node, checking for order violations.
   - If `node->val` is less than `prv->val`, record nodes:
     - On the first violation, set `fst` to `prv`.
     - On subsequent violations, set `scd` to `node`.
3. **Restore BST**:
   - After traversal, swap the values of `fst` and `scd` to correct the BST.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes, since each node is visited once during the traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack in the traversal.
