### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to find the maximum distance between two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(i\) is from the first array `nums1` and \(j\) is from the second array `nums2`, given the condition that the element at `nums1[i]` must be less than or equal to the element at `nums2[j]`. The goal is to determine the largest possible value of \(j - i\).

### Approach

To tackle this problem efficiently, we will leverage a binary search technique. The idea is to iterate through each element in `nums1`, and for each element, we will use binary search on `nums2` to find the largest index \(j\) such that `nums1[i] <= nums2[j]`. By maintaining a record of the maximum distance \(j - i\), we can arrive at the solution without having to resort to a brute-force method that would be less efficient.

### Code Breakdown (Step by Step)

1. **Class Definition**: We start by defining a class named `Solution`, which contains our main method.

    ```cpp
    class Solution {
    public:
    ```

2. **Method Declaration**: The method `maxDistance` takes two vectors of integers as input and returns an integer representing the maximum distance found.

    ```cpp
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
    ```

3. **Initialization**: We initialize a variable `ans` to store the maximum distance found throughout the iterations.

    ```cpp
    int ans = 0;
    ```

4. **Iterate Through `nums1`**: We use a for loop to iterate through each index \(i\) of `nums1`.

    ```cpp
    for(int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); i++) {
    ```

5. **Binary Search Setup**: For each index \(i\), we set up variables for a binary search. Here, `l` is initialized to the current index \(i\), `r` is set to the last index of `nums2`, and `j` is also initialized to \(i\).

    ```cpp
    int l = i, r = nums2.size() - 1, j = i;
    ```

6. **Target Element**: We define a variable `target` that holds the value of the current element in `nums1` that we want to compare against the elements in `nums2`.

    ```cpp
    int target = nums1[i]; // Find the largest index which satisfies target <= nums2[j]
    ```

7. **Binary Search Logic**: We perform a binary search within the bounds of `l` and `r`. The goal is to find the largest index \(j\) where `nums2[j]` is greater than or equal to `target`.

    ```cpp
    while(l <= r) {
        int mid = l + (r - l + 1) / 2; // Calculate mid index
    ```

8. **Comparison Conditions**: Inside the binary search, we compare `target` with `nums2[mid]`:
    - If `target < nums2[mid]`, it means we might have a valid \(j\), so we update `j` to `mid` and move the left bound up.
    - If `target > nums2[mid]`, we move the right bound down, since we need a larger element.
    - If they are equal, we still update `j` to `mid` and move the left bound up, searching for a potentially larger index.

    ```cpp
    if(target < nums2[mid]) {
        j = mid; // Update j to mid
        l = mid + 1; // Move left bound up
    } else if(target > nums2[mid]) {
        r = mid - 1; // Move right bound down
    } else if(target == nums2[mid]) {
        j = mid; // Update j to mid
        l = mid + 1; // Move left bound up
    }
    ```

9. **Update Maximum Distance**: After exiting the binary search, we calculate the distance \(j - i\) and update `ans` if this new distance is greater than the current maximum.

    ```cpp
    ans = max(ans, j - i);
    ```

10. **Return Result**: After iterating through all indices of `nums1`, we return the maximum distance found.

    ```cpp
    return ans;
    }
    ```

### Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \log m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `nums1` and \(m\) is the length of `nums2`. This complexity arises from iterating through each element of `nums1` and performing a binary search on `nums2`. The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are using a fixed number of additional variables regardless of the input size.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, this implementation efficiently finds the maximum distance between indices in two arrays under a specific condition using a combination of a for loop and binary search. By ensuring that we only check relevant elements in `nums2` for each element in `nums1`, we optimize the process and avoid unnecessary comparisons. This method demonstrates the effectiveness of binary search in solving problems involving sorted data, yielding a solution that is both optimal and elegant. As a result, this code is a practical example of algorithm design that leverages efficient searching techniques to achieve a desired outcome in a computationally feasible manner.
