### Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return the length of the longest common subarray between them. A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subarray that ends at `nums1[i-1]` and `nums2[j-1]`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize the `dp` array with dimensions `(n1 + 1) x (n2 + 1)`, where `n1` is the length of `nums1` and `n2` is the length of `nums2`.
   - The first row and first column are initialized to zero, representing the scenario of comparing with an empty array.

3. **State Transition**:
   - Iterate through each element of `nums1` and `nums2`:
     - If `nums1[i - 1]` is equal to `nums2[j - 1]`, then:
       - Set `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1` (indicating a common subarray has been found and its length increases).
       - Update `mx` with the maximum value found so far.

4. **Result**:
   - The value of `mx` holds the length of the longest common subarray.

### Code Walk-through
- **Function**:
  - `findLength(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2)`: Computes the length of the longest common subarray between the two arrays.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n1 * n2), where `n1` and `n2` are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively, due to the nested loop over both arrays.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n1 * n2) for the `dp` array used to store intermediate results.
