### Problem Statement
You are given two integers, `n` and `k`. The task is to construct an array of integers from `1` to `n` such that the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements is either `1` or `k`. The constructed array should maximize the value of `k`.

### Approach
1. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Use two pointers: one starting from the beginning (`i = 1`) and the other from the end (`j = n`) of the range.
   - This allows us to alternate between adding the smallest and largest available numbers to the result, ensuring we can achieve the desired differences.

2. **Building the Result Array**:
   - Use a loop that continues until both pointers meet.
   - If `k > 0`, alternate between pushing `i` and `j` based on the parity of `k`. 
     - If `k` is odd, push the smaller value (`i`) and increment it.
     - If `k` is even, push the larger value (`j`) and decrement it.
   - Once `k` reaches `0`, simply continue pushing the remaining numbers from the start.

### Code Walk-through
1. **Initialization**: An empty vector `res` is created to store the result.
2. **Looping Through**:
   - The loop runs while `i <= j`.
   - Depending on the value of `k`, numbers are pushed to the result vector, adjusting `i` and `j` as needed.
3. **Return Result**: After the loop, the constructed array is returned.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the resulting array. Each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the result array.
